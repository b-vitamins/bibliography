We prove that the ``cavity'' prediction for the limiting free energy per spin is correct for any positive temperature and external field.

Two error-prone patterns of interest include stopping sets for binary erasure channels (BECs) and trapping sets for general memoryless symmetric channels. Despite the provable hardness of the problem, this work provides an exhaustive enumeration algorithm that is computationally affordable when applied to codes of practical short lengths $n ≈ 500$. By exploiting the sparse connectivity of LDPC codes, the stopping sets of size $łeq 13$ and the trapping sets of size $łeq 11$ can be exhaustively enumerated. The central theorem behind the proposed algorithm is a new provably tight upper bound on the error rates of iterative decoding over BECs. Based on a tree-pruning technique, this upper bound can be iteratively sharpened until its asymptotic order equals that of the error floor.},

We present a stochastic local search algorithm called ChainSAT, which moves in the energy landscape of a problem instance by never going upwards in energy. ChainSAT is a focused algorithm in the sense that it considers only variables occurring in unsatisfied clauses. The extensive numerical investigations show that ChainSAT and other focused algorithms solve large K-SAT instances almost surely in linear time, up to high clause-to-variable ratios; for example, for K=4 they observe linear-time performance well beyond the recently postulated clustering and condensation transitions in the solution space. In the context of random K-SAT, it is folklore that stochastic local search algorithms appear to benefit from circumspect descent in energy, that is, from a conservative policy of lowering the number of clauses not satisfied by the trial configuration.},

@article{dembo2008scaling,
  abstract = {The (two) core of a hypergraph is the maximal collection of hyperedges within which no vertex appears only once. It is of importance in tasks such as efficiently solving a large linear system over GF[2], or iterative decoding of low-density parity-check codes used over the binary erasure channel. Similar structures emerge in a variety of NP-hard combinatorial optimization and decision problems, from vertex cover to satisfiability. For a uniformly chosen random hypergraph of $m=nh̊o$ vertices and $n$ hyperedges, each consisting of the same fixed number $l ≥ 3$ of vertices, the size of the core exhibits for large $n$ a first-order phase transition, changing from $o(n)$ for $ø̊ > _̊̊c$ to a positive fraction of $n$ for $\<̊̊ ρ$̊. Analyzing the corresponding "leaf removal" algorithm, we determine the associated finite-size scaling behavior. In particular, if $ρ$s̊ inside the scaling window (more precisely, $ρ =r̊ho_c r̊ n^-1/2$), the probability of having a core of size $Θ(n)$ has a limit strictly between 0 and 1, and a leading correction of order $Θ(n^-1/6)$. The correction admits a sharp characterization in terms of the distribution of a Brownian motion with quadratic shift, from which it inherits the scaling with $n$. This behavior is expected to be universal for a wide collection of combinatorial problems.},

  abstract = {Recent experimental studies indicate that synaptic changes induced by neuronal activity are discrete jumps between a small number of stable states. Learning in systems with discrete synapses is known to be a computationally hard problem. Here, we study a neurobiologically plausible on-line learning algorithm that derives from Belief Propagation algorithms. We show that it performs remarkably well in a model neuron with binary synapses, and a finite number of 'hidden' states per synapse, that has to learn a random classification task. Such system is able to learn a number of associations close to the theoretical limit, in time which is sublinear in system size. This is to our knowledge the first on-line algorithm that is able to achieve efficiently a finite number of patterns learned per binary synapse. Furthermore, we show that performance is optimal for a finite number of hidden states which becomes very small for sparse coding. The algorithm is similar to the standard 'perceptron' learning algorithm, with an additional rule for synaptic transitions which occur only if a currently presented pattern is 'barely correct'. In this case, the synaptic changes are meta-plastic only (change in hidden states and not in actual synaptic state), stabilizing the synapse in its current state. Finally, we show that a system with two visible states and K hidden states is much more robust to noise than a system with K visible states.

The analysis is carried out in the framework of Replica Symmetry Breaking theory and leads to the identification of low temperature glass phases of different kinds. Besides the usual `one-step' solution, known to reproduce all basic properties of structural glasses, also a physically consistent `two-step' solution arises. More complicated phases are found as well, as temperature is further decreased, expressing a complex variety of metastable states structures for amorphous systems.},

@article{krzakala2007phase,
  abstract = {We consider the problem of coloring the vertices of a large sparse random graph with a given number of colors so that no adjacent vertices have the same color. Using the cavity method, we present a detailed and systematic analytical study of the space of proper colorings (solutions). We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree (number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phase transitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses. First, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the phase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond this transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the space of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and consequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed one. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant states a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is allowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above the coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the critical connectivities for Erdős-Rényi and regular random graphs and determine their asymptotic values for large number of colors. We argue that the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering transition and suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the relevant phenomenon. We also discuss the performance of a simple local Walk-COL algorithm and of the belief propagation algorithm in the light of our results.},

In such applications, variables are fixed sequentially to satisfy the constraints. Message passing is run after each step. Its outcome provides an heuristic to make choices at next step. This approach has been referred to as `decimation,' with reference to analogous procedures in statistical physics. The behavior of decimation procedures is poorly understood. Here we consider a simple randomized decimation algorithm based on belief propagation (BP), and analyze its behavior on random k-satisfiability formulae. In particular, we propose a tree model for its analysis and we conjecture that it provides asymptotically exact predictions in the limit of large instances.

Yet, all known polynomial-time algorithms for these problems fail to find solutions even at much lower densities. To understand the origin of this gap we study how the structure of the space of solutions evolves in such problems as constraints are added. In particular, we prove that much before solutions disappear, they organize into an exponential number of clusters, each of which is relatively small and far apart from all other clusters. This suggests that the failure of polynomial-time algorithms is due to the fact that they cannot explore this exponentially large space of clusters. We establish rigorously one of the two main hypotheses underlying Survey Propagation, a heuristic introduced by physicists that appears to perform extraordinarily well on random constraint satisfaction problems.},

ASAT is significantly simpler than the benchmark WALKSAT heuristic. We show that ASAT solves instances as large as $N=10^6$ in linear time, on average, up to a ratio of 4.21 clauses per variable in random three-satisfiability.

In our previous work (2005) we showed that the max-product algorithm can be used to solve the problem of finding the maximum weight matching (MWM) in a weighted complete bipartite graph. However, for a graph with n nodes the max-product algorithm requires O(n extsuperscript4) operations to find the MWM compared to O(n extsuperscript3) for best known algorithms such as those proposed by Edmonds and Karp (1972) and Bertsekas (1988). In this paper, we simplify the max-product algorithm to reduce the number of operations required to O(n extsuperscript3). The simplified algorithm has very similar dynamics to the well-known auction algorithm of Bertsekas (1988).},

@article{achlioptas2005phase,
  abstract = {It is widely believed that for many optimization problems, no algorithm is substantially more efficient than exhaustive search. This means that finding optimal solutions for many practical problems is completely beyond any current or projected computational capacity. To understand the origin of this extreme 'hardness', computer scientists, mathematicians and physicists have been investigating for two decades a connection between computational complexity and phase transitions in random instances of constraint satisfaction problems. Here we present a mathematically rigorous method for locating such phase transitions. Our method works by analysing the distribution of distances between pairs of solutions as constraints are added. By identifying critical behaviour in the evolution of this distribution, we can pinpoint the threshold location for a number of problems, including the two most-studied ones: random k-SAT and random graph colouring.},

  abstract = {Max-product `belief propagation' is an iterative, local, message-passing algorithm for finding the maximum a posteriori (MAP) assignment of a discrete probability distribution specified by a graphical model. Despite the spectacular success of the algorithm in many application areas such as iterative decoding, computer vision and combinatorial optimization which involve graphs with many cycles, theoretical results about both correctness and convergence of the algorithm are known in few cases. In this paper we consider the problem of finding the Maximum Weight Matching (MWM) in a weighted complete bipartite graph. We define a probability distribution on the bipartite graph whose MAP assignment corresponds to the MWM. We use the max-product algorithm for finding the MAP of this distribution or equivalently, the MWM on the bipartite graph. Even though the underlying bipartite graph has many short cycles, we find that surprisingly, the max-product algorithm always converges to the correct MAP assignment as long as the MAP assignment is unique. We provide a bound on the number of iterations required by the algorithm and evaluate the computational cost of the algorithm. We find that for a graph of size $n$, the computational cost of the algorithm scales as $O(n^3)$, which is the same as the computational cost of the best known algorithm. Finally, we establish the precise relation between the max-product algorithm and the celebrated `auction' algorithm proposed by Bertsekas. This suggests possible connections between dual algorithm and max-product algorithm for discrete optimization problems.},

@article{braunstein2005propagation,
  abstract = {We study the satisfiability of randomly generated formulas formed by M clauses of exactly K literals over N Boolean variables. For a given value of N the problem is known to be most difficult when $α = M/N$ is close to the experimental threshold $α_c$ separating the region where almost all formulas are SAT from the region where all formulas are UNSAT. Recent results from a statistical physics analysis suggest that the difficulty is related to the existence of a clustering phenomenon of the solutions when $α$ is close to (but smaller than) $α_c$. We introduce a new type of message passing algorithm which allows to find efficiently a satisfying assignment of the variables in this difficult region. This algorithm is iterative and composed of two main parts. The first is a message-passing procedure which generalizes the usual methods like Sum-Product or Belief Propagation: It passes messages that may be thought of as surveys over clusters of the ordinary messages. The second part uses the detailed probabilistic information obtained from the surveys in order to fix variables and simplify the problem. Eventually, the simplified problem that remains is solved by a conventional heuristic.},

The first solver, called the 'SP diffusion algorithm', diffuses as dynamical information the maximum bias over the system, so that variable nodes can decide to freeze in a self-organized way, each variable making its decision on the basis of purely local information. The second solver, called the 'SP reinforcement algorithm', makes use of time-dependent external forcing messages on each variable, which let the variables get completely polarized in the direction of a solution at the end of a single convergence. Both methods allow us to find a solution of the random 3-SAT problem in a range of parameters comparable with the best previously described serialized solvers. The simulated time of convergence towards a solution (if these solvers were implemented on a distributed device) grows as log(N).},

Furthermore, a related Gaussian approximation allows us to describe the randomness which may persist in the limit when certain parameters take critical values. Our method is quite general, but is applied here to vertex identifiability in random hypergraphs. A vertex v is identifiable in n steps if there is a hyperedge containing v all of whose other vertices are identifiable in fewer steps. We say that a hyperedge is identifiable if every one of its vertices is identifiable. Our analytic formulae describe the asymptotics of the number of identifiable vertices and the number of identifiable hyperedges for a Poisson random hypergraph on a set V of N vertices, in the limit as N approaches infinity.},

@inproceedings{maneva2005propagation,
  abstract = {This paper provides a new conceptual perspective on survey propagation, which is an iterative algorithm recently introduced by the statistical physics community that is very effective in solving random k-SAT problems even with densities close to the satisfiability threshold. We first describe how any SAT formula can be associated with a novel family of Markov random fields (MRFs), parameterized by a real number ρ ∈ [0,1]. We then show that applying belief propagation--a well-known 'message-passing' technique for estimating marginal probabilities--to this family of MRFs recovers a known family of algorithms, ranging from pure survey propagation at one extreme (ρ = 1) to standard belief propagation on the uniform distribution over SAT assignments at the other extreme (ρ = 0). Configurations in these MRFs have a natural interpretation as partial satisfiability assignments, on which a partial order can be defined. We isolate cores as minimal elements in this partial ordering, which are also fixed points of survey propagation and the only assignments with positive probability in the MRF for ρ=1. Our experimental results for k=3 suggest that solutions of random formulas typically do not possess non-trivial cores. This makes it necessary to study the structure of the space of partial assignments for ρ<1 and investigate the role of assignments that are very close to being cores. To that end, we investigate the associated lattice structure, and prove a weight-preserving identity that shows how any MRF with ρ>0 can be viewed as a 'smoothed' version of the uniform distribution over satisfying assignments (ρ=0). Finally, we isolate properties of Gibbs sampling and message-passing algorithms that are typical for an ensemble of k-SAT problems.},

  abstract = {We develop and analyze methods for computing provably optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) configurations for a subclass of Markov random fields defined on graphs with cycles. By decomposing the original distribution into a convex combination of tree-structured distributions, we obtain an upper bound on the optimal value of the original problem (i.e., the log probability of the MAP assignment) in terms of the combined optimal values of the tree problems. We prove that this upper bound is tight if and only if all the tree distributions share an optimal configuration in common. An important implication is that any such shared configuration must also be a MAP configuration for the original distribution. Next we develop two approaches to attempting to obtain tight upper bounds: (a) a tree-relaxed linear program (LP), which is derived from the Lagrangian dual of the upper bounds; and (b) a tree-reweighted max-product message-passing algorithm that is related to but distinct from the max-product algorithm. In this way, we establish a connection between a certain LP relaxation of the mode-finding problem, and a reweighted form of the max-product (min-sum) message-passing algorithm.},

The belief propagation (BP) algorithm is an efficient way to solve these problems that is exact when the factor graph is a tree, but only approximate when the factor graph has cycles. We show that BP fixed points correspond to the stationary points of the Bethe approximation of the free energy for a factor graph. We explain how to obtain region-based free energy approximations that improve the Bethe approximation, and corresponding generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithms. We emphasize the conditions a free energy approximation must satisfy in order to be a valid or maxent-normal approximation. We describe the relationship between four different methods that can be used to generate valid approximations: the Bethe method, the junction graph method, the cluster variation method, and the region graph method. Finally, we explain how to tell whether a region-based approximation, and its corresponding GBP algorithm, is likely to be accurate, and describe empirical results showing that GBP can significantly outperform BP.},

We show that these equations can be derived as sum-product equations for the computation of marginals in an extended space where the variables are allowed to take an additional value -- $\*$ -- when they are not forced by the combinatorial constraints. An appropriate ``local equilibrium condition'' cost/energy function is introduced and its entropy is shown to coincide with the expected logarithm of the number of clusters of solutions as computed by SP. These results may help to clarify the geometrical notion of clusters assumed by SP for the random K-SAT or random graph coloring (where it is conjectured to be exact) and helps to explain which kind of clustering operation or approximation is enforced in general/small sized models in which it is known to be inexact.},

This book introduces in a rigorous manner this exciting new area to the mathematically minded reader. It requires no knowledge whatsoever of any physics, and contains proofs in complete detail of much of what is rigorously known on spin glasses at the time of writing.},

The minimum vertex cover corresponds to the ground state(s) of a proposed Ising spin model. When the connectivity $c > e = 2.718282$, there is no state for this system as the reweighting parameter $y$, which takes a similar role as the inverse temperature $β$ in conventional statistical physics, approaches infinity; consequently the ground state energy is obtained at a finite value of $y$ when the free energy function attains its maximum value. The minimum vertex cover size at given $c$ is estimated using population dynamics and compared with known rigorous bounds and numerical results. The backbone size is also calculated.},

Despite being classified as NP-complete, children around the world solve it daily when dividing into teams. This apparent contradiction highlights that not all instances of hard problems are actually hard to solve. The article explores how the success of playground algorithms suggests that the partitioning task is not always as intractable as the term "NP-complete" implies. Recent results using tools from physics, mathematics, and computer science reveal exactly where the hard problem instances hide. The number partitioning problem has applications beyond playground games, including dual-processor job scheduling and other resource-allocation tasks. The work demonstrates an easy-hard-easy phase transition where many problem instances remain trivial to solve even for large problem sizes, earning it the designation as "the easiest hard problem."},

Our work builds on recent results by Yedidia, Freeman, and Weiss (2000), who showed that the fixed points of BP and GBP algorithms correspond to extrema of the Bethe and Kikuchi free energies, respectively. We obtain two algorithms by applying CCCP to the Bethe and Kikuchi free energies, respectively (CCCP is a procedure, introduced here, for obtaining discrete iterative algorithms by decomposing a cost function into a concave and a convex part). We implement our CCCP algorithms on two- and three-dimensional spin glasses and compare their results to BP and GBP. Our simulations show that the CCCP algorithms are stable and converge very quickly (the speed of CCCP is similar to that of BP and GBP). Unlike CCCP, BP will often not converge for these problems (GBP usually, but not always, converges). The results found by CCCP applied to the Bethe or Kikuchi free energies are equivalent, or slightly better than, those found by BP or GBP, respectively (when BP and GBP converge). Note that for these, and other problems, BP and GBP give very accurate results (see Yedidia et al., 2000), and failure to converge is their major error mode. Finally, we point out that our algorithms have a large range of inference and learning applications.},

The addition of two new sections, numerous new results and 150 references means that this represents an up-to-date and comprehensive account of random graph theory. The theory (founded by Erdős and Rényi in the late fifties) aims to estimate the number of graphs of a given degree that exhibit certain properties. It not only has numerous combinatorial applications, but also serves as a model for the probabilistic treatment of more complicated random structures.},

@article{bollobas2001scaling,
  abstract = {We consider the random 2-satisfiability problem, in which each instance is a formula that is the conjunction of m clauses of the form (x or y), chosen uniformly at random from among all 2-clauses on n Boolean variables and their negations. As m and n tend to infinity in the ratio m/n → α, the problem is known to have a phase transition at α_c = 1, below which the probability that the formula is satisfiable tends to one and above which it tends to zero. We determine the finite-size scaling about this transition, namely the scaling of the maximal window W(n,δ) = (α_-(n,δ),α_+(n,δ)) such that the probability of satisfiability is greater than 1-δ for α < α_- and is less than δ for α > α_+. We show that W(n,δ)=(1-Θ(n^-1/3),1+Θ(n^-1/3)), where the constants implicit in Θ depend on δ. We also determine the rates at which the probability of satisfiability approaches one and zero at the boundaries of the window. Namely, for m=(1+ε)n, where ε may depend on n as long as |ε| is sufficiently small and |ε|n^1/3 is sufficiently large, we show that the probability of satisfiability decays like exp(-Θ(nε³)) above the window, and goes to one like 1-Θ(1/(n|ε|³)) below the window. We prove these results by defining an order parameter for the transition and establishing its scaling behavior in n both inside and outside the window. Using this order parameter, we prove that the 2-SAT phase transition is continuous with an order parameter critical exponent of 1. We also determine the values of two other critical exponents, showing that the exponents of 2-SAT are identical to those of the random graph.},

@article{borgs2001phase,
  abstract = {We consider the problem of partitioning n randomly chosen integers between 1 and 2^m into two subsets such that the discrepancy, the absolute value of the difference of their sums, is minimized. A partition is called perfect if the optimum discrepancy is 0 when the sum of all n integers in the original set is even, or 1 when the sum is odd. Parameterizing the random problem in terms of κ = m/n, we prove that the problem has a phase transition at κ=1, in the sense that for κ<1, there are many perfect partitions with probability tending to 1 as n → ∞, whereas for κ>1, there are no perfect partitions with probability tending to 1. Moreover, we show that this transition is first-order in the sense the derivative of the so-called entropy is discontinuous at κ=1. We also determine the finite-size scaling window about the transition point: κ_n = 1-(2n)^-1 log_2 n + λ_n/n, by showing that the probability of a perfect partition tends to 1, 0, or some explicitly computable p(λ) ∈ (0,1), depending on whether λ_n tends to -∞, ∞, or λ ∈ (-∞, ∞), respectively. For λ_n → -∞ fast enough, we show that the number of perfect partitions is Gaussian in the limit. For λ_n → ∞, we prove that with high probability the optimum partition is unique, and that the optimum discrepancy is Θ(2^n). Within the window, i.e., if |λ_n| is bounded, we prove that the optimum discrepancy is bounded. Both for λ_n → ∞ and within the window, we find the limiting distribution of the (scaled) discrepancy. Finally, for both the integer partitioning and continuous partitioning problem, we find the joint distribution of the k smallest discrepancies above the scaling window.},

Widely used solving procedures, as the Davis-Putnam-Loveland-Logemann (DPLL) algorithm, perform a systematic search for a solution, through a sequence of trials and errors represented by a search tree. The study identifies easy (size of the search tree scaling polynomially with N) and hard (exponential scaling) regimes as a function of the ratio α of constraints per variable. The typical complexity is explicitly calculated in the different regimes, in very good agreement with numerical simulations. Depending on whether or not the trajectories cross the boundary between satisfiable and unsatisfiable phases, single branches or full trees are generated by DPLL, resulting in easy or hard resolutions.},

  abstract = {A generalized state realization of the Wiberg (1996) type is called normal if symbol variables have degree 1 and state variables have degree 2. A natural graphical model of such a realization has leaf edges representing symbols, ordinary edges representing states, and vertices representing local constraints. Such a graph can be decoded by any version of the sum-product algorithm. Any state realization of a code can be put into normal form without essential change in the corresponding graph or in its decoding complexity. Group or linear codes are generated by group or linear state realizations. On a cycle-free graph, there exists a well-defined minimal canonical realization, and the sum-product algorithm is exact. However, the cut-set bound shows that graphs with cycles may have a superior performance-complexity tradeoff, although the sum-product algorithm is then inexact and iterative, and minimal realizations are not well-defined. Efficient cyclic and cycle-free realizations of Reed-Muller (RM) codes are given as examples. The dual of a normal group realization, appropriately defined, generates the dual group code. The dual realization has the same graph topology as the primal realization, replaces symbol and state variables by their character groups, and replaces primal local constraints by their duals.},

Following a single, simple computational rule, the sum-product algorithm computes---either exactly or approximately---various marginal functions derived from the global function.

By carefully designing these graphs we can construct for any given rate R and any given real number $ε$ a family of linear codes of rate R which can be encoded in time proportional to $łn(1/ε)$ times their block length $n$. Furthermore, a codeword can be recovered with high probability from a portion of its entries of length $(1+ε)Rn$ or more, and the recovery algorithm also runs in time proportional to $n łn(1/ε)$. These codes have exceedingly fast software implementations and should be useful for compensating for packet loss in internet traffic.

@article{richardson2001capacity,
  abstract = {We present a general method for determining the capacity of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes under message-passing decoding when used over any binary-input memoryless channel with discrete or continuous output alphabets. Transmitting at rates below this capacity, a randomly chosen element of the given ensemble will achieve an arbitrarily small target probability of error with a probability that approaches one exponentially fast in the length of the code. By concatenating with an appropriate outer code one can achieve a probability of error that approaches zero exponentially fast in the length of the code with arbitrarily small loss in rate. Conversely, transmitting at rates above this capacity the probability of error is bounded away from zero by a strictly positive constant which is independent of the length of the code and of the number of iterations performed. Our results are based on the observation that the concentration of the performance of the decoder around its average performance, as observed by Luby et al. in the case of a binary-symmetric channel and a binary message-passing algorithm, is a general phenomenon. For the particularly important case of belief-propagation decoders, we provide an effective algorithm to determine the corresponding capacity to any desired degree of accuracy. The ideas presented in this paper are broadly applicable and extensions of the general method to low-density parity-check codes over larger alphabets, turbo codes, and other concatenated coding schemes are outlined.},

Assuming that the underlying communication channel is symmetric, we prove that the probability densities at the message nodes of the graph possess a certain symmetry. Using this symmetry property we then show that, under the assumption of no cycles, the message densities always converge as the number of iterations tends to infinity. Furthermore, we prove a stability condition which implies an upper bound on the fraction of errors that a belief-propagation decoder can correct when applied to a code induced from a bipartite graph with a given degree distribution.},

Starting with an unbiased random bit at the root of the tree, the bit is sent down the edges of the tree, where on every edge the bit can be reversed with probability epsilon, and these errors occur independently. The goal is to reconstruct the original bit from the values which arrive at the nth level of the tree. We bound the reconstruction probability from above using the maximum flow on the tree viewed as a capacitated network, and from below using the electrical conductance of the tree. For general infinite trees, we establish a sharp threshold: the probability of correct reconstruction tends to 1/2 as n approaches infinity if (1-2epsilon)^2 is below a certain threshold value.},

A major challenge in computational biology is to uncover, from such measurements, gene/protein interactions and key biological features of cellular systems. In this paper, we propose a new framework for discovering interactions between genes based on multiple expression measurements. This framework builds on the use of Bayesian networks for representing statistical dependencies. A Bayesian network is a graph-based model of joint multivariate probability distributions that captures properties of conditional independence between variables. Such models are attractive for their ability to describe complex stochastic processes, and for providing clear methodologies for learning from (noisy) observations. We start by showing how Bayesian networks can describe interactions between genes. We then describe a method for recovering gene interactions from microarray data using tools for learning Bayesian networks. Finally, we demonstrate this method on the S. cerevisiae cell-cycle measurements of Spellman et al.},

However, there has been little understanding of the algorithm or the nature of the solutions it finds for general graphs. We show that BP can only converge to a stationary point of an approximate free energy, known as the Bethe free energy in statistical physics. This result characterizes BP fixed-points and makes connections with variational approaches to approximate inference. We then derive generalized belief propagation (GBP) versions of Kikuchi approximations. These new message passing algorithms can be significantly more accurate than ordinary BP, at an adjustable increase in complexity. We illustrate such a new GBP algorithm on a grid Markov network, and show that it gives much more accurate marginal probabilities than those found using ordinary BP.},

For 2-SAT it has been shown theoretically that a threshold phenomenon occurs at the critical value c=1. For 3-SAT experimental results show a sharp transition near c=4 but no such threshold phenomenon has already been proved. Noticing that the XOR-SAT problem (in which one uses the 'exclusive or' instead of the usual 'or') is a special case of satisfiability which is solvable in polynomial time as decision problem as well as counting problem leads to the natural question: is there a satisfiability threshold for XOR-SAT? In this paper, we answer this question in establishing a threshold phenomenon for XOR-SAT, with associated critical value c=1. We prove that F is satisfiable with probability 1-o(1) whenever c<1 and unsatisfiable with probability 1-o(1) whenever c>1 as n tends to infinity. We achieve more than just establishing the threshold. Indeed, in following the nice terminology classification given by Erdős and Rényi for random graphs, we obtain much better: we exhibit a probability distribution function that gives a complete understanding of the transition from satisfiability to unsatisfiability for random XOR-SAT formulas.},

We show that if $dp(P)/dp$ is small (corresponding to a non-sharp threshold), then there is a list of graphs of bounded size such that $P$ can be approximated by the property of having one of the graphs as a subgraph. One striking consequence of this result is that a coarse threshold for a random graph property can only happen when the value of the critical edge probability is a rational power of $n$.

The transmitted codeword comprises products of the original message bits selected by two randomly-constructed sparse matrices; the number of non-zero row/column elements in these matrices constitutes a family of codes. Shannon's channel capacity may be saturated in equilibrium for many of the regular codes while slightly lower performance is obtained for others which may be of higher practical relevance. Irregular codes may saturate Shannon's capacity but with improved dynamical properties. Decoding aspects are considered by employing the TAP approach which is identical to the commonly used belief-propagation-based decoding.},

This graph is a fascinating object of study: it has several hundred million nodes today, over a billion links, and appears to grow exponentially with time. There are many reasons — mathematical, sociological, and commercial — for studying the evolution of this graph. In this paper we begin by describing two algorithms that operate on the Web graph, addressing problems from Web search and automatic community discovery. We then report a number of measurements and properties of this graph that manifested themselves as we ran these algorithms on the Web. Finally, we observe that traditional random graph models do not explain these observations, and we propose a new family of random graph models.},

The decoding of both codes can be tackled with a practical sum-product algorithm. We prove that both families of codes are ``very good'', in that sequences of codes exist which, when optimally decoded, achieve information rates up to the Shannon limit. This result holds not only for the binary-symmetric channel but also for any channel with symmetric stationary ergodic noise. Experimental results demonstrate that practical performance substantially better than that of standard convolutional and concatenated codes can be achieved; indeed, the performance of Gallager codes is almost as close to the Shannon limit as that of turbo codes.},

Here we observe that these problems exhibit `phase boundaries' across which dramatic changes occur in computational difficulty and solution character---the problems become easier to solve away from the boundary. We report an analytic solution and experimental investigation of the phase transition in K-satisfiability, an archetypal NP-complete problem. Depending on the input parameters, the computing time may grow either exponentially or polynomially with problem size; in the former case, we observe a discontinuous transition, whereas in the latter case a continuous (second-order) transition is found. The nature of these transitions may explain the differing computational costs and suggests directions for improving the efficiency of search algorithms. Similar types of transitions should occur in other combinatorial problems and in glassy or granular materials, thereby strengthening the link between computational models and properties of physical systems.},

@inproceedings{schoning1999algorithm,
  abstract = {We present a simple probabilistic algorithm for solving $k$-SAT and more generally, for solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSP). The algorithm follows a simple local search paradigm: randomly guess an initial assignment and then, guided by those clauses (constraints) that are not satisfied, by successively choosing a random literal from such a clause and flipping the corresponding bit, try to find a satisfying assignment. If no satisfying assignment is found after $O(n)$ steps, start over again. We show that for any satisfiable $k$-CNF formula with $n$ variables this process has to be repeated only $t$ times, on the average, to find a satisfying assignment, where $t$ is within a polynomial factor of $(2(1-1/k))^n$. This is the fastest algorithm for $3$-SAT known up to date. We also consider the more general case of a CSP with $n$ variables, each variable taking at most $d$ values, and constraints of order $l$. It turns out that any CSP can be solved with complexity at most $(d · (1-1/l)+ε)^n$.},

We prove there is a phase transition at a critical value of this parameter. We show that constrainedness can be used to analyze and compare algorithms and heuristics for number partitioning in a precise and quantitative manner. For example, we demonstrate that on uniform random problems both the Karmarkar-Karp and greedy heuristics minimize the constrainedness, but that the decisions made by the Karmarkar-Karp heuristic are superior at reducing constrainedness. This supports the better performance observed experimentally for the Karmarkar-Karp heuristic. Our results refute a conjecture of Fu that phase transition behavior does not occur in number partitioning.

Probability theory serves as the glue whereby the parts are combined, ensuring that the system as a whole is consistent and providing ways to interface models to data. Graph theory provides both an intuitively appealing interface by which humans can model highly interacting sets of variables and a data structure that lends itself naturally to the design of efficient general-purpose algorithms.

This belief diagram has loops, and Pearl only proved that his algorithm works when there are no loops, so an explanation of the experimental performance of turbo decoding is still lacking. We also show that Pearl's algorithm can be used to routinely derive previously known iterative, but suboptimal, decoding algorithms for a number of other error-control systems, including Gallager's (1962) low-density parity-check codes, serially concatenated codes, and product codes.},

In this paper, we establish a general upper bound for r-SAT formulae that gives a value of 4.64 for 3-SAT.

The usual Poisson-Dirichlet distribution with a single parameter $þeta$, introduced by Kingman, is PD(0, $þeta$). Known properties of PD(0, $þeta$), including the Markov chain description due to Vershik, Shmidt and Ignatov, are generalized to the two-parameter case. The size-biased random permutation of PD($α$, $þeta$) is a simple residual allocation model proposed by Engen in the context of species diversity, and rediscovered by Perman and the authors in the study of excursions of Brownian motion and Bessel processes. For 0 < $α$ < 1, PD($α$, 0) is the asymptotic distribution of ranked lengths of excursions of a Markov chain away from a state whose recurrence time distribution is in the domain of attraction of a stable law of index $α$. The distribution of ranked lengths of excursions of a one-dimensional Brownian motion is PD(1/2, 0), and the corresponding distribution for a Brownian bridge is PD(1/2, 1/2).},

The validity of these algorithms depends crucially on the rate of convergence to equilibrium of the Markov chain being simulated. Unfortunately, the classical theory of stochastic processes hardly touches on the sort of non-asymptotic analysis required in this application. As a consequence, it had previously not been possible to make useful, mathematically rigorous statements about the quality of the estimates obtained. Within the last ten years, analytical tools have been devised with the aim of correcting this deficiency. As well as permitting the analysis of Monte Carlo algorithms for classical problems in statistical physics, the introduction of these tools has spurred the development of new approximation algorithms for a wider class of problems in combinatorial enumeration and optimization. The Markov chain Monte Carlo method exploits the idea that information about a set of combinatorial objects may be obtained by performing an appropriately defined random walk on those objects.},

@article{selman1996critical,
  abstract = {In previous work, we employed finite-size scaling, a method from statistical mechanics, to explore the crossover from the SAT regime of K-SAT, where almost all randomly generated expressions are satisfiable, to the UNSAT regime, where almost all are not. In this work, we extend the experiments to cover critical behavior in the computational cost. We find that the median computational cost takes on a universal form across the transition regime. Finite-size scaling accounts for its dependence on N (the number of variables) and on M (the number of clauses in the k-CNF expression). We also inquire into the sources of the complexity by studying distributions of computational cost. In the SAT phase we observe an unusually wide range of costs. The median cost increases linearly with N, while the mean is significantly increased over the median by a small fraction of cases in which exponentially large costs are incurred. We show that the large spread in cost of finding assignments is mainly due to the variability of running time of the Davis-Putnam (DP) procedure, used to determine the satisfiability of our expressions. In particular, if we consider a single satisfiable expression and run DP many times, each time randomly relabelling the variables in the expression, the resulting distribution of costs nearly reproduces the distribution of costs encountered by running DP search once on each of many such randomly generated satisfiable expressions.

We apply the method to the spherical p-spin glass and to some generalization of this model in the range of temperatures between the dynamic and the static transition. The analysis suggests a correspondence among local minima of the potential and metastable states.

One algorithm chooses the next literal from a unit clause if one exists and randomly from the set of remaining literals otherwise. The other algorithm uses a generalization of the unit-clause rule as a heuristic for selecting the next literal: at each step a literal is chosen randomly from a clause containing the least number of literals.

  abstract = {Bayesian belief networks provide a natural, efficient method for representing probabilistic dependencies among a set of variables. Algorithms have been developed previously for efficient probabilistic inference using special classes of belief networks. More general classes of belief networks, however, have eluded efforts to develop efficient inference algorithms. This paper establishes that probabilistic inference using belief networks is NP-hard. Therefore, it seems unlikely that an exact algorithm can be developed to perform probabilistic inference efficiently over all classes of belief networks. This result suggests that research should be directed away from the search for a general, efficient probabilistic inference algorithm, and toward the design of efficient special-case, average-case, and approximate algorithms.},

We present a systematic way to construct replica symmetry-breaking solutions of the spin glass on random lattices with finite (fixed or average) connectivity, generalizing Parisi's scheme to the case of infinitely many order parameters. A systematic expansion in inverse powers of the connectivity (M+1) is performed. At finite temperatures the expansion is in powers of 1/M, and at zero temperature in powers of 1/√M. The q's with larger number of indices contribute at higher orders in the expansion parameter. At zero temperature the results apply to the graph bipartitioning problem and are compared with numerical simulation. The agreement is of the order of ∼1%, for the range 9≤M≤20, much closer than the replica symmetric solution. Applications to graph partitioning problems demonstrate the relevance of statistical physics methods to combinatorial optimization.},

One wants to recover the information with the minimum error possible. In theory this is possible by increasing the power of the emitter source. But as the cost is proportional to the energy fed into the channel, it costs less to code the message before sending it, thus including redundant 'coding' bits, and to decode at the end. Coding theory provides rigorous bounds on the cost-effectiveness of any code. Here we show that theoretical models of magnetically disordered materials (spin glasses) provide a new class of error-correction codes that can, under certain circumstances, constitute the first known codes to saturate Shannon's well-known cost-performance bounds.},

Two distinct phase transitions are identified: at temperature T1, there is a transition with a jump in the order parameter but without latent heat; at a lower temperature T2, this phase becomes unstable and there is a second-order transition where the order parameter changes smoothly. This work introduces what is now known as the Gardner transition, where the free energy basin of a disordered system divides into many marginally stable sub-basins, establishing fundamental concepts in spin glass theory that continue to influence modern research in condensed matter physics and complex systems.},

However, the internal energy in the BPW method is identical to that obtained by SK, while the MRF neglects correlations and thus gives a different internal energy. Using a plausible phenomenological constant of integration, the microscopic free energy derived by Thouless, Anderson, and Palmer (TAP) is obtained. Using this free energy, it is shown that the BPW method with a random distribution of fields reproduces all the results of SK including a negative entropy of $-k/(2π)$ at $T=0$.},

While these Hamiltonians may be exactly soluble, a complete solution is not yet available. The thermodynamic properties of the model for Ising and XY spins are evaluated using a many-replica procedure. The results of the replica theory reproduce properties at and above the ordering temperature which are also predicted by high-temperature expansions, but are in error at low temperatures. Extensive computer simulations of infinite-ranged Ising spin-glasses are presented, which confirm the general details of the predicted phase diagram. The errors in the replica solution are found to be small, and confined to low temperatures. For this model, the extended mean-field theory of Thouless, Anderson, and Palmer gives physically sensible low-temperature predictions that are in quantitative agreement with the Monte Carlo statistics. The dynamics of the infinite-ranged Ising spin-glass are studied in a linearized mean-field theory, and critical slowing down is predicted and found.},

Low-density coding is one of the three techniques thus far developed for efficient communication over noisy channels with an arbitrarily low probability of error. A principal result of information theory is that if properly coded information is transmitted over a noisy channel at a rate below channel capacity, the probability of error can be made to approach zero exponentially with the code length. Any practical use of this theorem, however, requires a coding scheme in which the cost of storage and computation equipment grows slowly with code length. The present book analyzes a class of coding schemes for which costs grow approximately linearly with code length.},

The typical minimum distance of these codes increases linearly with block length for a fixed rate and fixed $j$. When used with maximum likelihood decoding on a sufficiently quiet binary-input symmetric channel, the typical probability of decoding error decreases exponentially with block length for a fixed rate and fixed $j$. A simple but nonoptimum decoding scheme operating directly from the channel a posteriori probabilities is described. Both the equipment complexity and the data-handling capacity in bits per second of this decoder increase approximately linearly with block length. For $j > 3$ and a sufficiently low rate, the probability of error using this decoder on a binary symmetric channel is shown to decrease at least exponentially with a root of the block length.},

@article{davis1960theory,
  abstract = {The hope that mathematical methods employed in the investigation of formal logic would lead to purely computational methods for obtaining mathematical theorems goes back to Leibniz and has been revived by Peano around the turn of the century and by Hilbert's school in the 1920's. Hilbert, noting that all of classical mathematics could be formalized within quantification theory, declared that the problem of finding an algorithm for determining whether or not a given formula of quantification theory is valid was the central problem of mathematical logic. It was shown by Church and by Turing that such an algorithm can not exist. This led to considerable pessimism regarding the possibility of using modern digital computers in deciding significant mathematical questions. But the point seems to have been overlooked that, though no decision procedure exists for quantification theory there are many proof procedures available--i.e., uniform procedures that will locate a proof for any formula of quantification theory that possesses a proof. Some of these procedures can be feasibly mechanized and may be expected to lead to the solution of some problems of real mathematical interest. This paper concerns a uniform proof procedure for quantification theory which is feasible for use with some rather complicated formulas and which does not ordinarily lead to exponentiation. A formula on which Gilmore's routine for the IBM 704 causes the machine to compute for 21 minutes without obtaining a result was worked successfully by hand computation using the present method in 30 minutes.},

@article{jaynes1957information,

It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment is then a question of whether Nature is in fact constructed in such a way that the particular models we use are valid approximations.},

The transition from the ordered to the disordered state occurs in a fairly small temperature range, and is accompanied by a large specific heat, an increase in electric resistance, etc. The mathematical method employed by Bragg and Williams is similar to that used in Weiss's theory of ferromagnetism.

  abstract = {This foundational paper in graph theory and topology presents the solution to the famous Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem. Euler proves that it is impossible to walk through the city crossing each of the seven bridges exactly once, introducing concepts that would later become fundamental to graph theory. The paper establishes the first theorem of graph theory by analyzing the degrees of vertices in what we now call a graph, laying the groundwork for the mathematical study of networks and topological relationships},
