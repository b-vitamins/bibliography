  abstract     = {Analogical reasoning is fundamental to human cognition and holds an important place in various fields. However, previous studies mainly focus on single-modal analogical reasoning and ignore taking advantage of structure knowledge. Notably, the research in cognitive psychology has demonstrated that information from multimodal sources always brings more powerful cognitive transfer than single modality sources. To this end, we introduce the new task of multimodal analogical reasoning over knowledge graphs, which requires multimodal reasoning ability with the help of background knowledge. Specifically, we construct a Multimodal Analogical Reasoning dataSet (MARS) and a multimodal knowledge graph MarKG. We evaluate with multimodal knowledge graph embedding and pre-trained Transformer baselines, illustrating the potential challenges of the proposed task. We further propose a novel model-agnostic Multimodal analogical reasoning framework with Transformer (MarT) motivated by the structure mapping theory, which can obtain better performance. Code and datasets are available in https://github.com/zjunlp/MKG_Analogy.},

  abstract     = {Despite the recent advancement in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the MARL agents easily overfit the training environment and perform poorly in the evaluation scenarios where other agents behave differently. Obtaining generalizable policies for MARL agents is thus necessary but challenging mainly due to complex multi-agent interactions. In this work, the authors model the problem with Markov Games and propose a simple yet effective method, ranked policy memory (RPM), to collect diverse multi-agent trajectories for training MARL policies with good generalizability. The main idea of RPM is to maintain a look-up memory of policies. In particular, they try to acquire various levels of behaviors by saving policies via ranking the training episode return, i.e., the episode return of agents in the training environment; when an episode starts, the learning agent can then choose a policy from the RPM as the behavior policy. This innovative self-play training framework leverages agents' past policies and guarantees the diversity of multi-agent interaction in the training data. The authors implement RPM on top of MARL algorithms and conduct extensive experiments on Melting Pot. It has been demonstrated that RPM enables MARL agents to interact with unseen agents in multi-agent generalization evaluation scenarios and complete given tasks, and it significantly boosts the performance up to 402\% on average.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is a subfield of machine learning where multiple clients try to collaboratively learn a model over a network under communication constraints. We consider finite-sum federated optimization under a second-order function similarity condition and strong convexity, and propose two new algorithms: SVRP and Catalyzed SVRP. This second-order similarity condition has grown popular recently, and is satisfied in many applications including distributed statistical learning and differentially private empirical risk minimization. The first algorithm, SVRP, combines approximate stochastic proximal point evaluations, client sampling, and variance reduction. We show that SVRP is communication efficient and achieves superior performance to many existing algorithms when function similarity is high enough. Our second algorithm, Catalyzed SVRP, is a Catalyst-accelerated variant of SVRP that achieves even better performance and uniformly improves upon existing algorithms for federated optimization under second-order similarity and strong convexity. In the course of analyzing these algorithms, we provide a new analysis of the Stochastic Proximal Point Method (SPPM) that might be of independent interest. Our analysis of SPPM is simple, allows for approximate proximal point evaluations, does not require any smoothness assumptions, and shows a clear benefit in communication complexity over ordinary distributed stochastic gradient descent.},

  abstract     = {Contrastive vision-language models (e.g. CLIP) are typically created by updating all the parameters of a vision model and language model through contrastive training. Can such models be created by a small number of parameter updates to an already-trained language model and vision model? The literature describes techniques that can create vision-language models by updating a small number of parameters in a language model, but these require already aligned visual representations and are non-contrastive, hence unusable for latency-sensitive applications such as neural search. We explore the feasibility and benefits of parameter-efficient contrastive vision-language alignment through transfer learning: creating a model such as CLIP by minimally updating an already-trained vision and language model. We demonstrate that a minimal set of parameter updates (<7\%) can achieve the same performance as full-model training, and updating specific components (<1\% of parameters) can match 75\% of full-model training. Additionally, changing a small number (<7\%) of parameters in already trained language and image models can match the performance of full model training for creating CLIP-like models. The research shows that parameter-efficient training constitutes an energy-efficient and effective training strategy for contrastive vision-language models that may be preferable to the full-model training paradigm for common use cases.},

In this context, we provide evidence that a learner succeeds if and only if it identifies the correct features, and moreover derive non-asymptotic generalization error bounds that precisely quantify the penalty that one must pay for not learning features. Our theoretical results are validated empirically on synthetic data and real data, demonstrating the importance of feature learning for long-tailed learning scenarios.},

This paper shows that in such settings, selectively fine-tuning a subset of layers (which we term surgical fine-tuning) matches or outperforms commonly used fine-tuning approaches. Moreover, the type of distribution shift influences which subset is more effective to tune: for example, for image corruptions, fine-tuning only the first few layers works best. We validate our findings systematically across seven real-world data tasks spanning three types of distribution shifts. We also prove that for two-layer neural networks in an idealized setting, first-layer tuning can outperform fine-tuning all layers.},

  abstract     = {Recent Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods are able to learn feature representations that are invariant to different data augmentations, which can then be transferred to downstream tasks of interest. However, different downstream tasks require different invariances for their best performance, so the optimal choice of augmentations for SSL depends on the target task. In this paper, we aim to learn self-supervised features that generalize well across a variety of downstream tasks (e.g., object classification, detection and instance segmentation) without knowing any task information beforehand. We do so by Masked Augmentation Subspace Training (or MAST) to encode in the single feature space the priors from different data augmentations in a factorized way. Specifically, we disentangle the feature space into separate subspaces, each induced by a learnable mask that selects relevant feature dimensions to model invariance to a specific augmentation. We show the success of MAST in jointly capturing generalizable priors from different augmentations, using both unique and shared features across the subspaces. We further show that MAST benefits from uncertainty modeling to reweight ambiguous samples from strong augmentations that may cause similarity mismatch in each subspace. Experiments demonstrate that MAST consistently improves generalization on various downstream tasks, while being task-agnostic and efficient during SSL.},

  abstract     = {In large-scale retrieval, the lexicon-weighting paradigm, learning weighted sparse representations in vocabulary space, has shown promising results with high quality and low latency. Despite it deeply exploiting the lexicon-representing capability of pre-trained language models, a crucial gap remains between language modeling and lexicon-weighting retrieval -- the former preferring certain or low-entropy words whereas the latter favoring pivot or high-entropy words -- becoming the main barrier to lexicon-weighting performance for large-scale retrieval. To bridge this gap, we propose a brand-new pre-training framework, lexicon-bottlenecked masked autoencoder (LexMAE), to learn importance-aware lexicon representations. Essentially, we present a lexicon-bottlenecked module between a normal language modeling encoder and a weakened decoder, where a continuous bag-of-words bottleneck is constructed to learn a lexicon-importance distribution in an unsupervised fashion. The pre-trained LexMAE is readily transferred to the lexicon-weighting retrieval via fine-tuning. On the ad-hoc retrieval benchmark, MS-Marco, it achieves 42.6\% MRR@10 with 45.8 QPS for the passage dataset and 44.4\% MRR@100 with 134.8 QPS for the document dataset, by a CPU machine. LexMAE shows state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer capability on BEIR benchmark with 12 datasets.},

We then prove that a simple representation obtained by combining this kernel with PCA provably minimizes the worst-case approximation error of linear predictors, under a straightforward assumption that positive pairs have similar labels. Our analysis is based on a decomposition of the target function in terms of the eigenfunctions of a positive-pair Markov chain, and a surprising equivalence between these eigenfunctions and the output of Kernel PCA. We give generalization bounds for downstream linear prediction using our kernel PCA representation, and show empirically on a set of synthetic tasks that applying kernel PCA to contrastive learning models can indeed approximately recover the Markov chain eigenfunctions, although the accuracy depends on the kernel parameterization as well as on the augmentation strength.},

  abstract     = {Discovering causal relationships between different variables from time series data has been a long-standing challenge for many domains. For example, in stock markets, the announcement of acquisitions from leading companies may have immediate effects on stock prices and increase the uncertainty of the future market due to this past action. To discover causal relations in such case, the model needs to consider non-linear relations between variables, instantaneous effect and the change of noise distribution due to past actions. We name the latter as history-dependent noise. However, previous works do not offer a solution addressing all these problems together. In this paper, we propose a structural equation model, called Rhino, which combines vector auto-regression, deep learning and variational inference to model non-linear relationships with instantaneous effects while allowing the noise distribution to be modulated by history observations. Theoretically, we prove the structural identifiability of Rhino. Our empirical results from extensive synthetic experiments and two real-world benchmarks demonstrate better discovery performance compared to relevant baselines, with ablation studies revealing its robustness under model misspecification.},

Model-based RL has the potential to be highly sample efficient by concurrently learning a world model and using synthetic rollouts for planning and policy improvement. However, in practice, sample-efficient learning with model-based RL is bottlenecked by the exploration challenge. In this work, we find that leveraging just a handful of demonstrations can dramatically improve the sample-efficiency of model-based RL. Simply appending demonstrations to the interaction dataset, however, does not suffice. We identify key ingredients for leveraging demonstrations in model learning -- policy pretraining, targeted exploration, and oversampling of demonstration data -- which forms the three phases of our model-based RL framework. We empirically study three complex visuo-motor control domains and find that our method is 160\%-250\% more successful in completing sparse reward tasks compared to prior approaches in the low data regime (100k interaction steps, 5 demonstrations).},

  abstract     = {Knowledge tracing (KT) is the problem of predicting students' future performance based on their historical interactions with intelligent tutoring systems. Recently, many works present lots of special methods for applying deep neural networks to KT from different perspectives like model architecture, adversarial augmentation and etc., which make the overall algorithm and system become more and more complex. Furthermore, due to the lack of standardized evaluation protocol, there is no widely agreed KT baselines and published experimental comparisons become inconsistent and self-contradictory, i.e., the reported AUC scores of DKT on ASSISTments2009 range from 0.721 to 0.821. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a strong but simple baseline method to deal with the KT task named simpleKT. Inspired by the Rasch model in psychometrics, we explicitly model question-specific variations to capture the individual differences. Furthermore, instead of using sophisticated representations to capture student forgetting behaviors, we use the ordinary dot-product attention function to extract the time-aware information embedded in the student learning interactions. Extensive experiments show that such a simple baseline is able to always rank top 3 in terms of AUC scores and achieve 57 wins, 3 ties and 16 loss against 12 DLKT baseline methods on 7 public datasets of different domains. We believe this work serves as a strong baseline for future KT research.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning models have proven to be successful in a wide range of machine learning tasks. Yet, they are often highly sensitive to perturbations on the input data which can lead to incorrect decisions with high confidence, hampering their deployment for practical use-cases. Thus, finding architectures that are (more) robust against perturbations has received much attention in recent years. Just like the search for well-performing architectures in terms of clean accuracy, this usually involves a tedious trial-and-error process with one additional challenge: the evaluation of a network's robustness is significantly more expensive than its evaluation for clean accuracy. Thus, the aim of this paper is to facilitate better streamlined research on architectural design choices with respect to their impact on robustness as well as, for example, the evaluation of surrogate measures for robustness. We therefore borrow one of the most commonly considered search spaces for neural architecture search for image classification, NAS-Bench-201, which contains a manageable size of 6,466 non-isomorphic network designs. We evaluate all these networks on a range of common adversarial attacks and corruption types and introduce a database on neural architecture design and robustness evaluations. We further present three exemplary use cases of this dataset, in which we (i) benchmark robustness measurements based on Jacobian and Hessian matrices for their robustness predictability, (ii) perform neural architecture search on robust accuracies, and (iii) provide an initial analysis of how architectural design choices affect robustness. We find that carefully crafting the topology of a network can have substantial impact on its robustness, where networks with the same parameter count range in mean adversarial robust accuracy from 20\%--41\%.

This work proposes a general mechanism, learnable randomness injection (LRI), which allows building inherently interpretable models based on general GDL backbones. LRI-induced models, once trained, can detect the points in the point cloud data that carry information indicative of the prediction label. We also propose four datasets from real scientific applications that cover the domains of high-energy physics and biochemistry to evaluate the LRI mechanism. Compared with previous post-hoc interpretation methods, the points detected by LRI align much better and stabler with the ground-truth patterns that have actual scientific meanings.},

  abstract     = {One of the main motivations of studying continual learning is that the problem setting allows a model to accrue knowledge from past tasks to learn new tasks more efficiently. However, recent studies suggest that the key metric that continual learning algorithms optimize, reduction in catastrophic forgetting, does not correlate well with the forward transfer of knowledge. We believe that the conclusion previous works reached is due to the way they measure forward transfer. We argue that the measure of forward transfer to a task should not be affected by the restrictions placed on the continual learner in order to preserve knowledge of previous tasks. Instead, forward transfer should be measured by how easy it is to learn a new task given a set of representations produced by continual learning on previous tasks. Under this notion of forward transfer, we evaluate different continual learning algorithms on a variety of image classification benchmarks. Our results indicate that less forgetful representations lead to a better forward transfer suggesting a strong correlation between retaining past information and learning efficiency on new tasks. Further, we found less forgetful representations to be more diverse and discriminative compared to their forgetful counterparts.},

We use a small set of exemplar molecules, i.e., those that (partially) satisfy the design criteria, to steer the pre-trained generative model towards synthesizing molecules that satisfy the given design criteria. We design a retrieval mechanism that retrieves and fuses the exemplar molecules with the input molecule, which is trained by a new self-supervised objective that predicts the nearest neighbor of the input molecule. We also propose an iterative refinement process to dynamically update the generated molecules and retrieval database for better generalization. Our approach is the first retrieval-based framework for controllable molecule generation and can effectively extrapolate beyond the retrieval database. We conduct thorough empirical studies on various tasks ranging from simple design criteria to a challenging real-world scenario for designing lead compounds that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.},

  abstract     = {We develop fast distribution-free conformal prediction algorithms for obtaining multivalid coverage on exchangeable data in the batch setting. Multivalid coverage guarantees are stronger than marginal coverage guarantees in two ways: (1) They hold even conditional on group membership---that is, the target coverage level $1-\alpha$ holds conditionally on membership in each of an arbitrary (potentially intersecting) group in a finite collection $\mathcal{G}$ of regions in the feature space. (2) They hold even conditional on the value of the threshold used to produce the prediction set on a given example. In fact multivalid coverage guarantees hold even when conditioning on group membership and threshold value simultaneously. We give two algorithms: both take as input an arbitrary non-conformity score and an arbitrary collection of possibly intersecting groups $\mathcal{G}$, and then can equip arbitrary black-box predictors with prediction sets. Our first algorithm is a direct extension of quantile regression, needs to solve only a single convex minimization problem, and produces an estimator which has group-conditional guarantees for each group in $\mathcal{G}$. Our second algorithm is iterative, and gives the full guarantees of multivalid conformal prediction: prediction sets that are valid conditionally both on group membership and non-conformity threshold. We evaluate the performance of both of our algorithms in an extensive set of experiments.},

  abstract     = {Extensive work has demonstrated that equivariant neural networks can significantly improve sample efficiency and generalization by enforcing an inductive bias in the network architecture. These applications typically assume that the domain symmetry is fully described by explicit transformations of the model inputs and outputs. However, many real-life applications contain only latent or partial symmetries which cannot be easily described by simple transformations of the input. In these cases, it is necessary to learn symmetry in the environment instead of imposing it mathematically on the network architecture. We discover, surprisingly, that imposing equivariance constraints that do not exactly match the domain symmetry is very helpful in learning the true symmetry in the environment. We differentiate between extrinsic and incorrect symmetry constraints and show that while imposing incorrect symmetry can impede the model's performance, imposing extrinsic symmetry can actually improve performance. We demonstrate that an equivariant model can significantly outperform non-equivariant methods on domains with latent symmetries both in supervised learning and in reinforcement learning for robotic manipulation and control problems.},

  abstract     = {State-of-the-art computer vision models are mostly trained with supervised learning using human-labeled images, which limits their scalability due to the expensive annotation cost. While self-supervised representation learning has achieved impressive progress, it still requires a second stage of finetuning on labeled data. On the other hand, models pre-trained with large-scale text-image supervision (e.g., CLIP) have enabled zero-shot transfer to downstream image classification tasks. However, the zero-shot performance of CLIP-like models are often insufficient for real-world adoption. In this paper, we aim to leverage the abundant unlabeled data to improve the performance of a pre-trained zero-shot classifier on downstream tasks. We propose Masked Unsupervised Self-Training (MUST), a new approach which leverages two different and complimentary sources of supervision: pseudo-labels and raw images. MUST jointly optimizes three objectives to learn both class-level global feature and pixel-level local feature and enforces a regularization between the two. We demonstrate the efficacy of MUST on 8 downstream tasks across a variety of domains, where it improves upon CLIP by a large margin and narrows the performance gap between unsupervised and supervised classification.},

We present the first single-call single-projection algorithm -- the Accelerated Reflected Gradient (ARG) method that achieves the optimal O(1/T) last-iterate convergence rate for inclusion problems that satisfy negative comonotonicity. We show that the Reflected Gradient (RG) method, another single-call single-projection algorithm, has O(1/√T) last-iterate convergence rate for constrained convex-concave min-max optimization, answering an open problem of Hsieh et al., 2019. Both the weak MVI and negative comonotonicity are well-studied assumptions and capture a rich set of non-convex non-concave min-max optimization problems.

Based on this perspective, we theoretically characterize how contrastive learning gradually learns discriminative features with the alignment update and the uniformity update. This perspective also establishes an intriguing connection between contrastive learning and Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs). This connection not only provides a unified understanding of many techniques independently developed in each community, but also enables borrowing techniques from MP-GNNs to design new contrastive learning variants, such as graph attention, graph rewiring, jumpy knowledge techniques, etc.},

The existence of entangled features makes the poisoned data become less useful for training a model, no matter if AT is applied or not. For attacking a CIFAR-10 AT model under a reasonable setting with ε_adv=ε_poi=8/255, our EntF yields an accuracy drop of 13.31%, which is 7× better than existing methods.

For neural networks, prior methods, including those based on ℓ₁ regularization, attention, and other techniques, typically select the entire feature subset in one evaluation round, ignoring the residual value of features during selection, i.e., the marginal contribution of a feature given that other features have already been selected. We propose a feature selection algorithm called Sequential Attention that achieves state-of-the-art empirical results for neural networks. This algorithm is based on an efficient one-pass implementation of greedy forward selection and uses attention weights at each step as a proxy for feature importance.},

  abstract     = {The expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is fundamental for understanding their capabilities and limitations, i.e., what graph properties can or cannot be learnt by a GNN. Since standard GNNs have been characterised to be upper-bounded by the Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) algorithm, recent attempts concentrated on developing more expressive GNNs in terms of the k-WL hierarchy, a well-established framework for graph isomorphism tests. In this work we show that, contrary to the widely accepted view, the k-WL hierarchy is not well-suited for measuring expressive GNNs. This is due to limitations that are inherent to high-dimensional WL algorithms such as the lack of a natural interpretation and high computational costs, which makes it difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the expressive power of GNNs beyond 1-WL. Thus, we propose a novel hierarchy of graph isomorphism tests, namely Neighbourhood WL (N-WL), and also establish a new theorem on the equivalence of expressivity between induced connected subgraphs and induced subgraphs within this hierarchy. Further, we design a GNN model upon N-WL, Graph Neighbourhood Neural Network (G3N), and empirically verify its expressive power on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.},

Do these networks just memorize a collection of surface statistics, or do they rely on internal representations of the process that generates the sequences they see? We investigate this question by applying a variant of the GPT model to the task of predicting legal moves in a simple board game, Othello. Although the network has no a priori knowledge of the game or its rules, we uncover evidence of an emergent nonlinear internal representation of the board state. Interventional experiments indicate this representation can be used to control the output of the network and create "latent saliency maps" that can help explain predictions in human terms.},

This has motivated the development of linear regression methods that also satisfy differential privacy and thus guarantee that the learned model reveals little about any one data point used to construct it. However, existing differentially private solutions assume that the end user can easily specify good data bounds and hyperparameters. Both present significant practical obstacles. In this paper, we study an algorithm which uses the exponential mechanism to select a model with high {T}ukey depth from a collection of non-private regression models. Given $n$ samples of $d$-dimensional data used to train $m$ models, we construct an efficient analogue using an approximate {T}ukey depth that runs in time $O(d^2n + dm\log(m))$. We find that this algorithm obtains strong empirical performance in the data-rich setting with no data bounds or hyperparameter selection required.},

Despite the advance of {CNN}s in image demoir{\'{e}}ing, existing networks are with heavy design, causing redundant computation burden for mobile devices. To accelerate existing {CNN}-based demoir{\'{e}}ing approaches, we launched the first study on accelerating demoir{\'{e}}ing networks and proposed a dynamic demoir{\'{e}}ing acceleration method ({DDA}) towards real-time deployment on mobile devices. Our approach stems from the observation that moir{\'{e}} patterns often unbalancedly distribute across an image, consequently, excessive computation is wasted upon non-moir{\'{e}} areas. Therefore, we reallocate computation costs in proportion to the complexity of image patches. We measure such complexity with a novel moir{\'{e}} prior that considers both colorfulness and frequency information of moir{\'{e}} patterns. These metrics will in turn be used to determine the network size adapted to each image patch. We train all networks in a parameter-shared supernet paradigm to avoid additional parameter burden. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed {DDA}. The acceleration evaluated on the {VIVO} {X}80 {P}ro smartphone equipped with a chip of {S}napdragon 8 {G}en 1 shows that our method can drastically reduce the inference time, leading to real-time image demoir{\'{e}}ing on mobile devices.},

In the learning-based sketching paradigm proposed by {I}ndyk et al., the sketch matrix is found by choosing a random sparse matrix, e.g., {C}ount{S}ketch, and then the values of its non-zero entries are updated by running gradient descent on a training data set. Despite the growing body of work on this paradigm, a noticeable omission is that previous algorithms fixed the locations of the non-zero entries, and only learned their values. In this work, we propose the first learning-based algorithms that also optimize the locations of the non-zero entries. We present a greedy search algorithm that can achieve good performance, as well as approaches for optimizing positions for sketches for low-rank approximation and second-order optimization, which run much faster than our greedy approach. We show that our approach can reduce errors by 30\% compared to previous learning-based sketches. For second-order optimization, we show that the convergence rate can be reduced by 87\% over the non-learned {C}ount{S}ketch for the {LASSO} problem on a real-world dataset. Our approaches work well even in few-shot learning settings where there is limited training data.},

In this paper, we present a new model named Score-based Tabular data Synthesis ({STaSy}) and its training strategy based on the paradigm of score-based generative modeling. Despite the fact that score-based generative models have resolved many issues in generative models, there still exists room for improvement in tabular data synthesis. Our proposed training strategy includes a self-paced learning technique and a fine-tuning strategy, which further increases the sampling quality and diversity by stabilizing the denoising score matching training. We conduct rigorous experimental studies in terms of the generative task trilemma: sampling quality, diversity, and time. In experiments with 15 benchmark tabular datasets and 7 baselines, our method outperformed existing methods in terms of task-dependent evaluations and diversity.},

  abstract     = {We present Masked Frequency Modeling ({MFM}), a unified frequency-domain-based approach for self-supervised pre-training of visual models. Instead of randomly inserting mask tokens to the input embeddings in the spatial domain, we shift the perspective to the frequency domain. Specifically, {MFM} first masks out a portion of frequency components of the input image and then predicts the missing frequencies on the frequency spectrum. The key insight is that predicting masked components in the frequency domain is more ideal to reveal underlying image patterns rather than predicting masked patches in the spatial domain, due to the heavy spatial redundancy. Our findings suggest that with the right configuration of mask-and-predict strategy, both the structural information within high-frequency components and the low-level statistics among low-frequency counterparts are useful in learning good representations. For the first time, {MFM} demonstrates that, for both {V}i{T} and {CNN}, a simple non-Siamese framework can learn meaningful representations even using none of the following: (i) extra data, (ii) extra model, (iii) mask token. Compared with other representative self-supervised learners, {MFM} can achieve comparable performance with fewer pre-training epochs. Experimental results on image classification and semantic segmentation, as well as several robustness benchmarks show the competitive performance and advanced robustness of {MFM} compared with recent masked image modeling approaches.},

An ideal solution for such a problem would be integrating both the text and graph structure information with large language models and graph neural networks ({GNN}s). However, the problem becomes very challenging when graphs are large due to the high computational complexity brought by training large language models and {GNN}s together. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective solution to learning on large text-attributed graphs by fusing graph structure and language learning with a variational Expectation-Maximization ({EM}) framework, called {GLEM}. Instead of simultaneously training large language models and {GNN}s on big graphs, {GLEM} proposes to alternatively update the two modules in the {E}-step and {M}-step. Such a procedure allows training the two modules separately while simultaneously allowing the two modules to interact and mutually enhance each other. In {E}-step, an {LM} is trained towards predicting both the gold and {GNN} predicted pseudolabels. In {M}-step, a {GNN} is trained by predicting both the gold and {LM} predicted pseudolabels. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

It also facilitates semi-automatic interactive annotation/proofreading via the sampling of structures and structure-aware uncertainty.

Self-consistency leverages the intuition that a complex reasoning problem typically admits multiple different ways of thinking leading to its unique correct answer.},

Most practical implementations of SGDA randomly reshuffle components and sequentially use them (i.e., without-replacement sampling); however, there are few theoretical results on this approach for minimax algorithms, especially outside the easier-to-analyze (strongly-)monotone setups. To narrow this gap, we study the convergence bounds of SGDA with random reshuffling (SGDA-RR) for smooth nonconvex-nonconcave objectives with Polyak-Lojasiewicz geometry.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing attention to large vision-language models such as CLIP, there has been a significant amount of effort dedicated to building efficient prompts. Unlike conventional methods of only learning one single prompt, we propose to learn multiple comprehensive prompts to describe diverse characteristics of categories such as intrinsic attributes or extrinsic contexts. However, directly matching each prompt to the same visual feature is problematic, as it pushes the prompts to converge to one point. To solve this problem, we propose to apply optimal transport to match the vision and text modalities. Specifically, we first model images and the categories with visual and textual feature sets. Then, we apply a two-stage optimization strategy to learn the prompts. In the inner loop, we optimize the optimal transport distance to align visual features and prompts by the Sinkhorn algorithm, while in the outer loop, we learn the prompts by this distance from the supervised data. Extensive experiments are conducted on the few-shot recognition task and the improvement demonstrates the superiority of our method.},

Most efforts are devoted to advancing optimization objectives that regularize models to capture the underlying invariance; however, there often are compromises in the optimization process of these OOD objectives. Many OOD objectives have to be relaxed as penalty terms of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) for the ease of optimization, while the relaxed forms can weaken the robustness of the original objective. To address these issues, we introduce a multi-objective optimization (MOO) perspective to understand the OOD optimization process, and propose a new optimization scheme called PAreto Invariant Risk Minimization (PAIR). PAIR improves the robustness of OOD objectives by cooperatively optimizing with other OOD objectives, thereby bridging the gaps caused by the relaxations.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning in partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) faces two challenges: (i) It often takes the full history to predict the future, which induces a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the horizon. (ii) The observation and state spaces are often continuous, which induces a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the extrinsic dimension. Addressing such challenges requires learning a minimal but sufficient representation of the observation and state histories by exploiting the structure of the POMDP. To this end, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm named Embed to Control (ETC), which learns the representation at two levels while optimizing the policy. For each step, ETC learns to represent the state with a low-dimensional feature, which factorizes the transition kernel. Across multiple steps, ETC learns to represent the full history with a low-dimensional embedding, which assembles the per-step feature. For a class of POMDPs with a low-rank structure in the transition kernel, ETC attains an O(1/ε²) sample complexity that scales polynomially with the horizon and the intrinsic dimension.},

We introduce, for the first time, the problem of machine unlearning for FC, and propose an efficient unlearning mechanism for a customized secure FC framework. The FC framework utilizes special initialization procedures that are well-suited for unlearning. To protect client data privacy, we develop the secure compressed multiset aggregation (SCMA) framework that addresses sparse secure federated learning (FL) problems. Simulation results show that the new FC framework exhibits superior clustering performance compared to previously reported FC baselines when the cluster sizes are highly imbalanced. Compared to completely retraining K-means++ locally and globally for each removal request, our unlearning procedure offers an average speed-up of roughly 84x across seven datasets.},

We study EoS phenomenon by constructing a simple function that has the same behavior and give rigorous analysis for its training dynamics in a large local region and explain why the final converging point has sharpness close to $2/\eta$.

Existing data augmentation methods either potentially cause shifts in decision boundaries (representation interpolation), are not expressive enough (token replacement), or introduce too much computational overhead (augmentation with models). Our method builds on top of representation interpolation augmentation methods to maintain the diversity of expressions and converts the augmented data to tokens to avoid shifting decision boundaries. It uses simple operations that come with little computational overhead. The results on multiple GLUE tasks show that our methods can improve distillation performance by a large margin at a low time cost.},

Recently, the emerge of masked image modeling (MIM), a self-supervised visual pre-training method, raised a new challenge to vision transformers in terms of flexibility. In this paper, we delve deep into the comparison between ViT and Swin, revealing that (i) the performance gain of Swin is mainly brought by a deepened backbone and relative positional encoding, (ii) the hierarchical design of Swin can be simplified into hierarchical patch embedding (proposed in this work), and (iii) other designs such as shifted-window attentions can be removed. By removing the unnecessary operations, we come up with a new architecture named HiViT (short for hierarchical ViT), which is simpler and more efficient than Swin yet further improves its performance on fully-supervised and self-supervised visual representation learning.},

To this end, we identify two properties in dialogue modeling, i.e., locality and isotropy, and present a simple method for dialogue representation calibration, namely SimDRC, to build isotropic and conversational feature spaces. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art models on three dialogue tasks across the automatic and human evaluation metrics. More in-depth analyses further confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Real-world data usually couples the label ambiguity and heavy imbalance, challenging the algorithmic robustness of partial label learning (PLL) and long-tailed learning (LT). The straightforward combination of LT and PLL, i.e., LT-PLL, suffers from a fundamental dilemma: LT methods build upon a given class distribution that is unavailable in PLL, and the performance of PLL is severely influenced in long-tailed context. We show that even with the auxiliary of an oracle class prior, the state-of-the-art methods underperform due to an adverse fact that the constant rebalancing in LT is harsh to the label disambiguation in PLL. To overcome this challenge, we thus propose a dynamic rebalancing method, termed as RECORDS, without assuming any prior knowledge about the class distribution. Based on a parametric decomposition of the biased output, our method constructs a dynamic adjustment that is benign to the label disambiguation process and theoretically converges to the oracle class prior.},

  abstract     = {This paper challenges the cross-species generalization problem for animal pose estimation, aiming to learn a pose estimator that can be well generalized to novel species. We find the relation between different joints is important with two-fold impact: 1) on the one hand, some relation is consistent across all the species and may help two joints mutually confirm each other, e.g., the eyes help confirm the nose and vice versa because they are close in all species. 2) on the other hand, some relation is inconsistent for different species due to the species variation and may bring severe distraction rather than benefit. With these two insights, we propose a Decompose-to-Generalize (D-Gen) pose estimation method to break the inconsistent relations while preserving the consistent ones. Specifically, D-Gen first decomposes the body joints into several joint concepts so that each concept contains multiple closely-related joints.},

In this paper, we propose an effective approximate SkewIoU loss based on Gaussian modeling and Gaussian product, which mainly consists of two items. The first term is a scale-insensitive center point loss, which is used to quickly narrow the distance between the center points of the two bounding boxes. In the distance-independent second term, the product of the Gaussian distributions is adopted to inherently mimic the mechanism of SkewIoU by its definition, and show its alignment with the SkewIoU loss at trend-level within a certain distance. The resulting new loss called KFIoU loss is easier to implement and works better compared with exact SkewIoU loss, thanks to its full differentiability and ability to handle the non-overlapping cases.},

  abstract     = {There is a recent trend of applying multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train an agent that can cooperate with humans in a zero-shot fashion without using any human data. The typical workflow is to first repeatedly run self-play (SP) to build a policy pool and then train the final adaptive policy against this pool. A crucial limitation of this framework is that every policy in the pool is optimized w.r.t. the environment reward function, which implicitly assumes that the testing partners of the adaptive policy will be precisely optimizing the same reward function as well. However, human objectives are often substantially biased according to their own preferences, which can differ greatly from the environment reward. We propose a more general framework, Hidden-Utility Self-Play (HSP), which explicitly models human biases as hidden reward functions in the self-play objective.},

Although considerable improvement has been achieved, the quality of synthesized images is far from satisfactory due to three largely unresolved challenges. 1) The semantic labels do not provide detailed structural information, making it difficult to synthesize local details and structures. 2) The widely adopted CNN operations such as convolution, down-sampling, and normalization usually cause spatial resolution loss and thus cannot fully preserve the original semantic information, leading to semantically inconsistent results (e.g., missing small objects). 3) Existing semantic image synthesis methods focus on modeling 'local' semantic information from a single input semantic layout. However, they ignore 'global' semantic information of multiple input semantic layouts, i.e., semantic cross-relations between pixels across different input layouts. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel contrastive learning method, which aims to enforce pixel embeddings belonging to the same semantic class to generate more similar image content than those from different classes.},

Context clusters (CoCs) view an image as a set of unorganized points and extract features via a simplified clustering algorithm. In detail, each point includes the raw feature (e.g., color) and positional information (e.g., coordinates), and a simplified clustering algorithm is employed to group and extract deep features hierarchically.},

In this paper, we show that the {MLI} property is not necessarily related to the hardness of optimization problems, and empirical observations on {MLI} for deep neural networks depend heavily on biases. In particular, we show that interpolating both weights and biases linearly leads to very different influences on the final output, and when different classes have different last-layer biases on a deep network, there will be a long plateau in both the loss and accuracy interpolation (which existing theory of {MLI} cannot explain). We also show how the last-layer biases for different classes can be different even on a perfectly balanced dataset using a simple model.},

To circumvent this dilemma, instead of changing the model architecture, we decouple {DNN}s into an encoder followed by a linear classifier and propose to restrict the function space of a {DNN} by a representation regularizer. Particularly, we require the distance between two self-supervised features to be positively related to the distance between the corresponding two supervised model outputs. Our proposed framework is easily extendable and can incorporate many other robust loss functions to further improve performance.},

  abstract     = {Due to the significant computational challenge of training large-scale graph neural networks ({GNN}s), various sparse learning techniques have been exploited to reduce memory and storage costs. Examples include graph sparsification that samples a subgraph to reduce the amount of data aggregation and model sparsification that prunes the neural network to reduce the number of trainable weights. Despite the empirical successes in reducing the training cost while maintaining the test accuracy, the theoretical generalization analysis of sparse learning for {GNN}s remains elusive. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical characterization of joint edge-model sparse learning from the perspective of sample complexity and convergence rate in achieving zero generalization error.},

  abstract     = {Offline reinforcement learning ({RL}) aims at learning an optimal strategy using a pre-collected dataset without further interactions with the environment. While various algorithms have been proposed for offline {RL} in the previous literature, the minimax optimality has only been (nearly) established for tabular Markov decision processes ({MDP}s). In this paper, we focus on offline {RL} with linear function approximation and propose a new pessimism-based algorithm for offline linear {MDP}. At the core of our algorithm is the uncertainty decomposition via a reference function, which is new in the literature of offline {RL} under linear function approximation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our algorithm can match the performance lower bound up to logarithmic factors. We also extend our techniques to the two-player zero-sum Markov games ({MG}s), and establish a new performance lower bound for {MG}s, which tightens the existing result, and verifies the nearly minimax optimality of the proposed algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first computationally efficient and nearly minimax optimal algorithms for offline single-agent {MDP}s and {MG}s with linear function approximation.},

Existing approaches to differentiable {DTW} either differentiate through a fixed warping path or apply a differentiable relaxation to the min operator found in the recursive steps used to solve the {DTW} problem. We instead propose a {DTW} layer based around bi-level optimisation and deep declarative networks, which we name {DecDTW}. By formulating {DTW} as a continuous, inequality constrained optimisation problem, we can compute gradients for the solution of the optimal alignment (with respect to the underlying time series) using implicit differentiation. An interesting byproduct of this formulation is that {DecDTW} outputs the optimal warping path between two time series as opposed to a soft approximation, recoverable from Soft-{DTW}.},

We present an approach that combines constraint programming with both theoretical insights into the problem structure and prior information about admissible causal interactions to achieve speed up of multiple orders of magnitude. The resulting system scales to significantly larger sets of random variables (>100) without knowledge of the timescale difference while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Rather than removing the information associated with a concept that may induce bias, our proposed method identifies two concept subspaces and makes them orthogonal. The resulting representation has these two concepts uncorrelated, one can simply apply a rotation on the basis of the representation so that the resulting subspace corresponds with coordinates. This explicit encoding of concepts to coordinates works because they have been made fully orthogonal, which previous approaches do not achieve. The proposed debiasing technique significantly improves the amount of debiasing while retaining relevant information in the embedding representation. The method can also be extended to multiple subspace debiasing, allowing one to choose a subset of concepts to be represented transparently and explicitly while the others are retained in the mixed but extremely expressive format.},

In this work, we propose a regularizer that enforces the reconstruction of features from the output logits to overcome SB. We find that while SB may not altogether preclude learning complex features, it amplifies simpler features over complex ones. Specifically, simple features are replicated several times in the learned representations while complex features might not be replicated, making them difficult to extract from mixed representations and increasing susceptibility to noise and adversarial perturbations. Our proposed regularizer ensures that complex features are also well-represented by requiring reconstruction from the output. We show that our method improves OOD performance on several datasets and provide theoretical justifications for the approach.},

Existing approaches propose ways to mitigate the effect of label error on a model's downstream accuracy, yet little is known about its impact on a model's group-based disparity metrics. Here we study the effect of label error on a model's group-based disparity metrics like group calibration. We empirically characterize how varying levels of label error, in both training and test data, affect these disparity metrics. We find that group calibration and other metrics are sensitive to train-time and test-time label error—particularly for minority groups. This disparate effect persists even for models trained with noise-aware algorithms. To mitigate the impact of training-time label error, we present an approach to estimate the influence of a training input's label on a model's group disparity metric. We empirically assess the proposed approach on a variety of datasets and find significant improvement, compared to alternative approaches, in identifying training inputs that improve a model's disparity metric.},

In particular, the information plane analysis, which measures mutual information ({MI}) between input and representation as well as representation and output, should give rich insights into the training process. This approach, however, was shown to strongly depend on the choice of estimator of the {MI}. The problem is amplified for deterministic networks if the {MI} between input and representation is infinite. Thus, the estimated values are defined by the different approaches for estimation, but do not adequately represent the training process from an information-theoretic perspective. In this work, we show that dropout with continuously distributed noise ensures that {MI} is finite. We demonstrate in a range of experiments that this enables a meaningful information plane analysis for a class of dropout neural networks that is widely used in practice.},

  abstract     = {Classical wisdom suggests that estimators should avoid fitting noise to achieve good generalization. In contrast, modern overparameterized models can yield small test error despite interpolating noise—a phenomenon often called "benign overfitting" or "harmless interpolation". This paper argues that the degree to which interpolation is harmless hinges upon the strength of an estimator's inductive bias, i.e., how heavily the estimator favors solutions with a certain structure: while strong inductive biases prevent harmless interpolation, weak inductive biases can even require fitting noise to generalize well. Our main theoretical result establishes tight non-asymptotic bounds for high-dimensional kernel regression that reflect this phenomenon for convolutional kernels, where the filter size regulates the strength of the inductive bias. We provide empirical evidence of the same behavior for deep neural networks with varying filter sizes and rotational invariance.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of computing the 1-Wasserstein distance between two $d$-dimensional discrete distributions whose support lie within the unit hypercube. There are several algorithms that estimate the Wasserstein distance within an additive error of $\varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ can be very small. However, when the Wasserstein distance is small, the additive error $\varepsilon$ dominates, leading to noisy results. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that runs in $O(T(n,\varepsilon/d) \log n)$ time and boosts the accuracy of estimating the Wasserstein distance from $\varepsilon$ to an expected additive error of $\min\{\varepsilon, (d \log_{\sqrt{d/\varepsilon}} n)W(\mu,\nu)\}$, where $W(\mu,\nu)$ is the true 1-Wasserstein distance between $\mu$ and $\nu$. This result provides significantly higher precision when the distance is small.},

The challenge lies in rendering $k$-subset sampling amenable to end-to-end learning. This has typically involved relaxing the reparameterized samples to allow for backpropagation, but introduces both bias and variance. In this work, we fall back to discrete $k$-subset sampling on the forward pass. This is coupled with using the gradient with respect to the exact marginals, computed efficiently, as a proxy for the true gradient. We show that our gradient estimator exhibits lower variance compared to existing approaches, leading to faster convergence in end-to-end learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several machine learning tasks including feature selection, attention mechanisms, and sparse neural network training.},

  abstract     = {Class imbalance problems frequently occur in real-world tasks, and conventional deep learning algorithms are well known for performance degradation on imbalanced training datasets. To mitigate this problem, many approaches have aimed to balance among given classes by re-weighting or re-sampling training samples. These re-balancing methods increase the impact of minority classes and reduce the influence of majority classes on the output of models. However, the extracted representations may be of poor quality owing to the limited number of minority samples. To handle this restriction, several methods have been developed that increase the representations of minority samples by leveraging the features of the majority samples. Despite extensive recent studies, no deep analysis has been conducted on determination of classes to be augmented and strength of augmentation has been conducted. In this study, we first investigate the correlation between the degree of augmentation and class-wise performance, and find that the proper degree of augmentation must be allocated for each class to mitigate class imbalance problems. Motivated by this finding, we propose a simple and efficient novel curriculum, which is designed to find the appropriate per-class strength of data augmentation, called {CUDA}: {CU}rriculum of {D}ata {A}ugmentation for long-tailed recognition. {CUDA} can simply be integrated into existing long-tailed recognition methods. We present the results of experiments showing that {CUDA} effectively achieves better generalization performance compared to the state-of-the-art method on various imbalanced datasets such as {CIFAR}-100-{LT}, {I}mage{N}et-{LT}, and i{N}aturalist 2018.},

  abstract     = {The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the training dataset setup. In particular, when attributes with a strong correlation with the target attribute are present, the trained model can provide unintended prejudgments and show significant inference errors (i.e., the dataset bias problem). Various methods have been proposed to mitigate dataset bias, and their emphasis is on weakly correlated samples, called bias-conflicting samples. These methods are based on explicit bias labels provided by humans. However, such methods require human costs. Recently, several studies have sought to reduce human intervention by utilizing the output space values of neural networks, such as feature space, logits, loss, or accuracy. However, these output space values may be insufficient for the model to understand the bias attributes well. In this study, we propose a debiasing algorithm leveraging gradient called {P}er-sample {G}radient-based {D}ebiasing ({PGD}). {PGD} is comprised of three steps: (1) training a model on uniform batch sampling, (2) setting the importance of each sample in proportion to the norm of the sample gradient, and (3) training the model using importance-batch sampling, whose probability is obtained in step (2). Compared with existing baselines for various datasets, the proposed method showed state-of-the-art accuracy for the classification task. Furthermore, we describe theoretical understandings of how {PGD} can mitigate dataset bias.},

We argue that neural network loss landscapes often contain (nearly) a single basin after accounting for all possible permutation symmetries of hidden units a la Entezari et al. 2021. We introduce three algorithms to permute the units of one model to bring them into alignment with a reference model in order to merge the two models in weight space. This transformation produces a functionally equivalent set of weights that lie in an approximately convex basin near the reference model. Experimentally, we demonstrate the single basin phenomenon across a variety of model architectures and datasets, including the first (to our knowledge) demonstration of zero barrier linear connectivity between independently trained models.},

We investigate whether these methods can directly address the problem of sequential decision-making. We view decision-making not through the lens of reinforcement learning ({RL}), but rather through conditional generative modeling. To our surprise, we find that our formulation leads to policies that can outperform existing offline {RL} approaches across standard benchmarks. By modeling a policy as a return-conditional generative model, we avoid the need for dynamic programming and subsequently eliminate many of the complexities that come with traditional offline {RL}. We further demonstrate the advantages of modeling policies as conditional generative models by considering two other conditioning variables: constraints and skills. Conditioning on a single constraint or skill during training leads to behaviors at test-time that can satisfy several constraints together or demonstrate a composition of skills. Our results illustrate that conditional generative modeling is a powerful tool for decision-making.},

To address this issue, we investigate the excess risk of two-layer {R}e{LU} neural networks in a teacher-student regression model, in which a student network learns an unknown teacher network through its outputs. Especially, we consider the student network that has the same width as the teacher network and is trained in two phases: first by noisy gradient descent and then by the vanilla gradient descent. Our result shows that the student network provably reaches a near-global optimal solution and outperforms any kernel methods estimator (more generally, linear estimators), including neural tangent kernel approach, random feature model, and other kernel methods, in a sense of the minimax optimal rate. The key concept inducing this superiority is the non-convexity of the neural network models. Even though the loss landscape is highly non-convex, the student network adaptively learns the teacher neurons.},

We investigate the hypothesis that transformer-based in-context learners implement standard learning algorithms implicitly, by encoding context-specific parametric models in their hidden representations, and updating these implicit models as new examples appear in the context. Using linear regression as a model problem, we offer three sources of evidence for this hypothesis. First, we prove by construction that transformers can implement learning algorithms for linear models based on gradient descent and closed-form computation of regression parameters. Second, we show that trained in-context learners closely match the predictors computed by gradient descent, ridge regression, and exact least-squares regression, transitioning between different predictors as transformer depth and dataset noise vary.},

In this work, we show that using this regularizer under a mixture distribution of the policy and the expert provides a particularly illuminating perspective: the original objective can be understood as squared {B}ellman error minimization. We build on the {I}nverse soft {Q}-{L}earning ({IQ}-{L}earn) approach and analyze the effect of this squared norm regularizer.

Unlike conventional normalizing flow inference methods based the maximum likelihood principle, which require costly backpropagation through {ODE} solvers, our interpolant approach leads to a simple quadratic loss for the velocity itself which is expressed in terms of expectations that are readily amenable to empirical estimation. The flow can be used to generate samples from either the base or target, and to estimate the likelihood at any time along the interpolant. In addition, the flow can be optimized to minimize the path length of the interpolant density, thereby paving the way for building optimal transport maps.},

We develop a theory showing that when data has a structure we call ``multi-view'', then ensemble of independently trained neural networks can provably improve test accuracy, and such superior test accuracy can also be provably distilled into a single model. Our result sheds light on how ensemble works in deep learning in a way that is completely different from traditional learning theory such as boosting, and how the ``dark knowledge'' is hidden in the outputs of the ensemble and can be used in distillation. Additionally, we prove that self-distillation can also be viewed as implicitly combining ensemble and knowledge distillation to improve test accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Biological vision systems are unparalleled in their ability to learn visual representations without supervision. In machine learning, self-supervised learning ({SSL}) has led to major advances in forming object representations in an unsupervised fashion. Such systems learn representations invariant to augmentation operations over images, like cropping or flipping. In contrast, biological vision systems exploit the temporal structure of the visual experience during natural interactions with objects. This gives access to 'augmentations' not commonly used in {SSL}, like watching the same object from multiple viewpoints or against different backgrounds. Here, we systematically investigate and compare the potential benefits of such time-based augmentations during natural interactions for learning object categories. Our results show that time-based augmentations achieve large performance gains over state-of-the-art image augmentations. Specifically, our analyses reveal that: 1) {3-D} object manipulations drastically improve the learning of object categories; 2) viewing objects against changing backgrounds is important for learning to discard background-related information from the latent representation. Overall, we conclude that time-based augmentations during natural interactions with objects can substantially improve self-supervised learning, narrowing the gap between artificial and biological vision systems.},

Towards this goal, recent works have begun to train language models on narrative datasets which require extracting the most critical information by integrating across long contexts. However, it is still an open question whether these models are learning a deeper understanding of the text, or if the models are simply learning a heuristic to complete the task. This work investigates this further by turning to the one language processing system that truly understands complex language: the human brain. We show that training language models for deeper narrative understanding results in richer representations that have improved alignment to human brain activity. The improvements in brain alignment are larger for character names than for other discourse features, which indicates that these models are learning important narrative elements.},

Unlike prior work that studies the setting of zero bias, we consider the more challenging scenario when the bias of the {ReLU} function is non-zero. Our main result establishes that starting from random initialization, in a polynomial number of iterations gradient descent outputs, with high probability, a {ReLU} function that achieves an error that is within a constant factor of the optimal error of the best {ReLU} function with moderate bias. The paper guarantees achieving an error of {O}({OPT}), where {OPT} is the error of the best {ReLU} function. This is a significant improvement over existing guarantees for gradient descent, which only guarantee error of {O}(√{d} · {OPT}) even in the zero-bias case. We also provide finite sample guarantees, and these techniques generalize to a broader class of marginal distributions beyond Gaussians.},

In this work, we propose {GLGExplainer} ({Global Logic-based GNN Explainer}), the first Global Explainer capable of generating explanations as arbitrary Boolean combinations of learned graphical concepts. {GLGExplainer} is a fully differentiable architecture that takes local explanations as inputs and combines them into a logic formula over graphical concepts, represented as clusters of local explanations. Contrary to existing solutions, {GLGExplainer} provides accurate and human-interpretable global explanations that are perfectly aligned with ground-truth explanations (on synthetic data) or match existing domain knowledge (on real-world data). Extracted formulas are faithful to the model predictions, to the point of providing insights into some occasionally incorrect rules learned by the model, making {GLGExplainer} a promising diagnostic tool for learned {GNNs}.},

In practice, {VAEs} usually require multiple training rounds to choose the amount of information the latent variable should retain. This trade-off between the reconstruction error (distortion) and the {KL} divergence (rate) is typically parameterized by a hyperparameter β. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Rate {VAE} ({MR-VAE}), a computationally efficient framework for learning optimal parameters corresponding to various β in a single training run. The key idea is to explicitly formulate a response function using hypernetworks that maps β to the optimal parameters. {MR-VAEs} construct a compact response hypernetwork where the pre-activations are conditionally gated based on β. We justify the proposed architecture by analyzing linear {VAEs} and showing that it can represent response functions exactly for linear {VAEs}. With the learned hypernetwork, {MR-VAEs} can construct the rate-distortion curve without additional training and can be deployed with significantly less hyperparameter tuning. Empirically, our approach is competitive and often exceeds the performance of multiple β-{VAEs} training with minimal computation and memory overheads.},

The advancement of this area is challenged by: 1) characterizing data distribution drift and its impacts on models, 2) expressiveness in tracking the model dynamics, and 3) theoretical guarantee on the performance. To address them, we propose a Temporal Domain Generalization with Drift-Aware Dynamic Neural Network ({DRAIN}) framework. Specifically, we formulate the problem into a Bayesian framework that jointly models the relation between data and model dynamics. We then build a recurrent graph generation scenario to characterize the dynamic graph-structured neural networks learned across different time points. The {DRAIN} framework addresses the key challenges in temporal domain generalization by using a Bayesian approach to model the relationship between evolving data distributions and corresponding model dynamics over time.},

  abstract     = {Though Self-supervised learning ({SSL}) has been widely studied as a promising technique for representation learning, it doesn't generalize well on long-tailed datasets due to the majority classes dominating the feature space. Recent work shows that the long-tailed learning performance could be boosted by sampling extra in-domain ({ID}) data for self-supervised training, however, large-scale {ID} data which can rebalance the minority classes are expensive to collect. In this paper, we propose an alternative but easy-to-use and effective solution, Contrastive with Out-of-distribution ({OOD}) data for Long-Tail learning ({COLT}), which can effectively exploit {OOD} data to dynamically re-balance the feature space. We empirically identify the counter-intuitive usefulness of {OOD} samples in {SSL} long-tailed learning and principally design a novel {SSL} method. Concretely, we first localize the 'head' and 'tail' samples by assigning a tailness score to each {OOD} sample based on its neighborhoods in the feature space. Then, we propose an online {OOD} sampling strategy to dynamically re-balance the feature space. Finally, we enforce the model to be capable of distinguishing {ID} and {OOD} samples by a distribution-level supervised contrastive loss. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets and several state-of-the-art {SSL} frameworks to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that our method significantly improves the performance of {SSL} on long-tailed datasets by a large margin, and even outperforms previous work which uses external {ID} data.},

The most widely adopted approach for concept-based interpretation is Concept Activation Vector ({CAV}). {CAV} relies on learning a linear relation between some latent representation of a given model and concepts. The linear separability is usually implicitly assumed but does not hold true in general. In this work, we started from the original intent of concept-based interpretation and proposed Concept Gradient ({CG}), extending concept-based interpretation beyond linear concept functions. We showed that for a general (potentially non-linear) concept, we can mathematically evaluate how a small change of concept affecting the model's prediction, which leads to an extension of gradient-based interpretation to the concept space. We demonstrated empirically that {CG} outperforms {CAV} in both toy examples and real world datasets. The paper addresses a key limitation of existing concept-based interpretation methods by removing the assumption that meaningful concepts lie in a linear subspace of model layers and instead extending concept-based gradient interpretation methods to non-linear concept functions.},

  abstract     = {No-press Diplomacy is a complex strategy game involving both cooperation and competition that has served as a benchmark for multi-agent {AI} research. While self-play reinforcement learning has resulted in numerous successes in purely adversarial games like chess, Go, and poker, self-play alone is insufficient for achieving optimal performance in domains involving cooperation with humans. We address this shortcoming by first introducing a planning algorithm called {DiL-piKL} that regularizes a reward-maximizing policy toward a human imitation-learned policy. We prove that this is a no-regret learning algorithm under a modified utility function. We then show that {DiL-piKL} can be extended into a self-play reinforcement learning algorithm called {RL-DiL-piKL} that provides a model of human play while simultaneously training an agent that responds well to this human model. We used {RL-DiL-piKL} to train an agent named Diplodocus. In a 200-game no-press Diplomacy tournament involving 62 human participants spanning skill levels from beginner to expert, two Diplodocus agents both achieved a higher average score than all other participants who played more than two games, and ranked first and third according to an Elo ratings model.},

The main drawback is efficiency -- most kernel-based algorithms require materializing a full n × n kernel matrix, incurring Ω(n²) runtime. Breaking this quadratic barrier has been an extensive research effort. We give a framework for using recently developed tools for kernel density estimation to solve downstream kernel problems in sub-quadratic time. The paper proposes subquadratic time algorithms for various linear-algebraic and graph processing tasks by leveraging kernel density estimation. They demonstrate significant improvements, including 9x decrease in kernel evaluations for low-rank approximation and 41x reduction in graph size for spectral sparsification.},

In this paper, we propose a method to extract concise discrete representations for audio that can be used for efficient retrieval. Our motivation comes from orthography which represents speech of a given language in a concise and distinct discrete form. The proposed method, wav2tok, learns such representations for any kind of audio, speech or non-speech, from pairs of similar audio. wav2tok compresses the query and target sequences into shorter sequences of tokens that are faster to match. The learning method makes use of CTC loss and expectation-maximization algorithm, which are generally used for supervised automatic speech recognition and for learning discrete latent variables, respectively. Experiments show the consistent performance of wav2tok across two audio retrieval tasks: music search (query by humming) and speech search via audio query, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.},

Formally, we show that EEGSDE naturally exploits the geometric symmetry in 3D molecular conformation, as long as the energy function is invariant to orthogonal transformations. Empirically, under the guidance of designed energy functions, EEGSDE significantly improves the baseline on QM9, in inverse molecular design targeted to quantum properties and molecular structures. Furthermore, EEGSDE is able to generate molecules with multiple target properties by combining the corresponding energy functions linearly.},

Since transformers are parameter-heavy, cannot benefit from history longer than a fixed window size, and are not computed using recurrence, we set out to investigate the suitability of the S4 family of models, which are based on state-space layers and have been shown to outperform transformers, especially in modeling long-range dependencies. In this work, we present two main algorithms: (i) an off-policy training procedure that works with trajectories, while still maintaining the training efficiency of the S4 model. (ii) An on-policy training procedure that is trained in a recurrent manner, benefits from long-range dependencies, and is based on a novel stable actor-critic mechanism. The method outperforms multiple variants of decision transformers, as well as other baseline methods on most tasks, while reducing the latency, number of parameters, and training time by several orders of magnitude.},

We study these effects through the node classification problem of a non-linearly separable Gaussian mixture model coupled with a stochastic block model. First, we show that a single graph convolution expands the regime of the distance between the means where multi-layer networks can classify the data by a factor of at least 1/√[4]{deg}, where deg denotes the expected degree of a node. Second, we show that with a slightly stronger graph density, two graph convolutions improve this factor to at least 1/√[4]{n}, where n is the number of nodes in the graph.},

In this work, we tackle the problem of learning representations that are robust to biases. We first present a margin-based theoretical framework that allows us to clarify why recent contrastive losses (InfoNCE, SupCon, etc.) can fail when dealing with biased data. Based on that, we derive a novel formulation of the supervised contrastive loss (ε-SupInfoNCE), providing more accurate control of the minimal distance between positive and negative samples. Furthermore, thanks to our theoretical framework, we also propose FairKL, a new debiasing regularization loss, that works well even with extremely biased data.},

Our results indicate that (1) with ReLU activation, the eigenvalues of these residual kernels decay polynomially at a similar rate compared to the same kernels when skip connections are not used, thus maintaining a similar frequency bias; (2) however, residual kernels are more locally biased. Our analysis further shows that the matrices obtained by these residual kernels yield favorable condition numbers at finite depths than those obtained without the skip connections, enabling therefore faster convergence of training with gradient descent.},

However, the design constraints and objectives typically change dynamically in real-life scenarios. Furthermore, storing a policy for each potential preference is not scalable. Hence, obtaining a set of Pareto front solutions for the entire preference space in a given domain with a single training is critical. The paper presents a novel approach that obtains a single policy network optimizing multiple objectives using multi-objective reinforcement learning on challenging continuous control tasks. The algorithm learns a single policy for the whole Pareto front for multi-objective continuous robotic tasks and was successfully applied to energy-harvesting of wearable devices and heterogeneous SoC scheduling.},

Our benchmark demonstrates that state-of-the-art approaches fail catastrophically on difficult tasks, with accuracy dropping by up to 40% compared to their performance on standard benchmarks. We investigate what makes some tasks harder than others and find that task difficulty is related to the underlying data distribution and the number of distinguishing features between classes.

RAD uses a principled selection criterion that balances informativeness and teacher reliability, leading to more efficient and robust knowledge distillation. Our experiments on various datasets demonstrate that RAD significantly outperforms existing active learning baselines and achieves superior performance with fewer labeled examples, making it an effective solution for semi-supervised knowledge distillation.},

To this end, the two main challenges are estimating gradients of the target model without access to its parameters, and generating a diverse set of training samples that thoroughly explores the input space. We propose a Dual Student method where two students are symmetrically trained in order to provide the generator a criterion to generate samples that the two students disagree on. On one hand, disagreement on a sample implies at least one student has classified the sample incorrectly when compared to the target model. This incentive towards disagreement implicitly encourages the generator to explore more diverse regions of the input space.},

The proposed estimation method called the subspace encoder approach (SUBNET) ascertains these results by efficiently approximating the complete simulation loss by evaluating short simulations on subsections of the data, by using an encoder function to estimate the initial state for each subsection and a novel state-derivative normalization to ensure stability and good numerical conditioning of the training process.},

As a result, the solution encodings can be chosen flexibly and compactly. Furthermore, our methodology is general and virtually independent of the specifics of the target problem type.},

IPS achieves this by selecting only the most salient patches, which are then aggregated into a global representation for image recognition. For both patch selection and aggregation, a cross-attention based transformer is introduced, which exhibits a close connection to Multiple Instance Learning. Our method demonstrates strong performance and has wide applicability across different domains, training regimes and image sizes while using minimal accelerator memory.},

In contrast, we consider multifactor disentanglement in which multiple (more than two) semantic disentangled components are generated. Key to our approach is a strong inductive bias where we assume that the underlying dynamics can be represented linearly in the latent space. However, disentangled representations are not guaranteed in Koopman approaches, and thus we propose a novel spectral loss term which leads to structured Koopman matrices and disentanglement. Overall, we propose a simple and easy to code new deep model that is fully unsupervised and it supports multifactor disentanglement.},

This accuracy is typically measured in terms of a generalization error, that is, an expected value of a given loss function. However, for several applications -- for example in a security-critical context or for problems in the computational sciences -- accuracy in this sense is not sufficient. In such cases, one would like to have guarantees for high accuracy on every input value, that is, with respect to the uniform norm. In this paper we precisely quantify the number of training samples needed for any conceivable training algorithm to guarantee a given uniform accuracy on any learning problem formulated over target classes containing (or consisting of) ReLU neural networks of a prescribed architecture. We prove that, under very general assumptions, the minimal number of training samples for this task scales exponentially both in the depth and the input dimension of the network architecture.},

  abstract     = {Self-training (ST), or pseudo-labeling has sparked significant interest in the automatic speech recognition (ASR) community recently because of its success in harnessing unlabeled data. Unlike prior semi-supervised learning approaches that relied on iteratively regenerating pseudo-labels (PLs) from a trained model and using them to train a new model, recent state-of-the-art methods perform 'continuous training' where PLs are generated using a very recent version of the model being trained. Nevertheless, these approaches still rely on bootstrapping the ST using an initial supervised learning phase where the model is trained on labeled data alone. We believe this has the potential for over-fitting to the labeled dataset in low resource settings and that ST from the start of training should reduce over-fitting. In this paper we show how we can do this by dynamically controlling the evolution of PLs during the training process in ASR.},

  abstract     = {Neural fields are receiving increased attention as a geometric representation due to their ability to compactly store detailed and smooth shapes and easily undergo topological changes. Compared to classic geometry representations, however, neural representations do not allow the user to exert intuitive control over the shape. Motivated by this, we leverage boundary sensitivity to express how perturbations in parameters move the shape boundary. This allows to interpret the effect of each learnable parameter and study achievable deformations. With this, we perform geometric editing: finding a parameter update that best approximates a globally prescribed deformation. Prescribing the deformation only locally allows the rest of the shape to change according to some prior, such as semantics or deformation rigidity. Our method is agnostic to the model its training and updates the NN in-place. Furthermore, we show how boundary sensitivity helps to optimize and constrain objectives (such as surface area and volume), which are difficult to compute without first converting to another representation, such as a mesh.},

Thus, inspired by the Global Workspace Theory of conscious information access in the brain, we propose TAMiL, a continual learning method that entails task-attention modules to capture task-specific information from the common representation space. We employ simple, undercomplete autoencoders to create a communication bottleneck between the common representation space and the global workspace, allowing only the task-relevant information to the global workspace, thus greatly reducing task interference.},

In this paper, we propose BALTO, a fast TPO approach with biased-diversity-based active learning, aiming at reducing much lower training costs under similar optimization accuracy. The key insight is that random sampling of existing approaches suffers from a heavy redundancy of low-performance programs, which incurs tremendous duplicated time-consuming measurements. Inspired by this, BALTO removes such redundancy by introducing active learning (AL) to TPO for a much lower training cost. To address this, we further propose a biased-diversity-based diversity scheme specially designed for BALTO.},

Nevertheless, software developers benefit from fast iteration loops where automated tools identify errors as early as possible, even before programs can be compiled and run. This presents an interesting machine learning challenge: can we predict runtime errors in a ''static'' setting, where program execution is not possible? We introduce a real-world dataset and task for predicting runtime errors, which we show is difficult for generic models like Transformers. As an alternative, we develop an interpreter-inspired architecture with an inductive bias towards mimicking program executions, which models exception handling and ''learns to execute'' descriptions of the contents of external resources. Surprisingly, we show that the model can also predict the location of the error, despite being trained only on labels indicating the presence/absence and kind of error.},

We derive a novel dual variational representation that can be used to construct numerically tractable divergence estimators. This representation avoids risk-sensitive terms and therefore exhibits lower variance, making it well-behaved when α>1; this addresses a notable weakness of prior approaches. We prove several properties of these new divergences, showing that they interpolate between the classical Rényi divergences and IPMs. We also study the α→∞ limit, which leads to a regularized worst-case-regret and a new variational representation in the classical case.},

In this paper, we present a graph based neural ODE, GNODE, to learn the time evolution of dynamical systems.

These two perspectives combine elegantly in neural latent variable models that constrain the relationship between latent variables and neural activity, modeled by simple tuning curve functions. This has recently been demonstrated using Gaussian processes, with applications to realistic and topologically relevant latent manifolds. Those and previous models, however, missed crucial shared coding properties of neural populations. We propose feature sharing across neural tuning curves which significantly improves performance and helps optimization. We also propose a solution to the ensemble detection problem, where different groups of neurons, i.e., ensembles, can be modulated by different latent manifolds. Achieved through a soft clustering of neurons during training, this allows for the separation of mixed neural populations in an unsupervised manner. These innovations lead to more interpretable models of neural population activity that train well and perform better even on mixtures of complex latent manifolds. Finally, we apply our method on a recently published grid cell dataset, and recover distinct ensembles, infer toroidal latents and predict neural tuning curves in a single integrated modeling framework.},

We consider the problem of privately releasing L₂-heavy hitters in the sliding window model, which include Lₚ-heavy hitters for p≤2 and represent the strongest possible guarantees that can be achieved using polylogarithmic space. However, these cannot be handled by existing techniques due to the sub-additivity of the L₂ norm, and existing non-private sliding window algorithms use the smooth histogram framework, which has high sensitivity. We use smooth sensitivity and statistical distance arguments to show that we can add noise proportional to an estimation of the L₂ norm. To the best of our knowledge, our techniques are the first to privately release statistics that are related to a sub-additive function in the sliding window model, and may be of independent interest to future differentially private algorithmic design in the sliding window model.},

However, most existing spectral graph filters are scalar-to-scalar functions, i.e., mapping a single eigenvalue to a single filtered value, thus ignoring the global pattern of the spectrum. Furthermore, these filters are often constructed based on some fixed-order polynomials, which have limited expressiveness and flexibility. To tackle these issues, we introduce Specformer, which effectively encodes the set of all eigenvalues and performs self-attention in the spectral domain, leading to a learnable set-to-set spectral filter. We also design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution. Importantly, Specformer is equivariant to permutation. By stacking multiple Specformer layers, one can build a powerful spectral GNN. On synthetic datasets, Specformer can better recover ground-truth spectral filters than other spectral GNNs. Extensive experiments of both node-level and graph-level tasks on real-world graph datasets show that our Specformer outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and learns meaningful spectrum patterns.},

While these techniques would seem to be usable in concert, improving one another, how to build an interface between them is not well-understood. In this work, we propose a model fusing programmatic weak supervision and generative adversarial networks and provide theoretical justification motivating this fusion. The proposed approach captures discrete latent variables in the data alongside the weak supervision derived label estimate. Alignment of the two allows for better modeling of sample-dependent accuracies of the weak supervision sources, improving the estimate of unobserved labels.},

The inherent inextricable trade-off between those objectives leads one to the task of exploring their Pareto front. A meaningful quantity for the purpose of the latter is the hypervolume indicator, which is used in Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). However, the computational complexity for the calculation of the hypervolume scales unfavorably with increasing number of objectives and data points, which restricts its use in those common multi-objective optimization frameworks. To overcome these restrictions we propose to approximate the hypervolume function with a deep neural network, which we call DeepHV. For better sample efficiency and generalization, we exploit the fact that the hypervolume is scale-equivariant in each of the objectives as well as permutation invariant w.r.t. both the objectives and the samples, by using a deep neural network that is equivariant w.r.t. the combined group of scalings and permutations. We evaluate our method against exact, and approximate hypervolume methods in terms of accuracy, computation time, and generalization. We also apply and compare our methods to state-of-the-art multi-objective BO methods and EAs on a range of synthetic benchmark test cases. The results show that our methods are promising for such multi-objective optimization tasks.},

This problem can be circumvented by self-supervised approaches based on contrastive learning, such as SimCLR, relying on data augmentation to generate implicit neighbors, but these methods do not produce two-dimensional embeddings suitable for visualization. Here, we present a new method, called t-SimCNE, for unsupervised visualization of image data. T-SimCNE combines ideas from contrastive learning and neighbor embeddings, and trains a parametric mapping from the high-dimensional pixel space into two dimensions. We show that the resulting 2D embeddings achieve classification accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art high-dimensional SimCLR representations, thus faithfully capturing semantic relationships. Using t-SimCNE, we obtain informative visualizations of the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, showing rich cluster structure and highlighting artifacts and outliers.},

The overhead complexity of the backward mode turns out to be independent of the dimension when using programs with locally Lipschitz semi-algebraic or definable elementary functions. This considerably extends Baur-Strassen's smooth cheap gradient principle. We illustrate our results by establishing fast backpropagation results of conservative gradients through feedforward neural networks with standard activation and loss functions. Nonsmooth backpropagation's cheapness contrasts with concurrent forward approaches, which have, to this day, dimensional-dependent worst-case overhead estimates. We provide further results suggesting the superiority of backward propagation of conservative gradients. Indeed, we relate the complexity of computing a large number of directional derivatives to that of matrix multiplication, and we show that finding two subgradients in the Clarke subdifferential of a function is an NP-hard problem.},

ToMe can also easily be applied during training, improving in practice training speed up to 2x for MAE fine-tuning on video. Training with ToMe further minimizes accuracy drop, leading to 2x the throughput of ViT-B on audio for only a 0.4\% mAP drop.

We focus more specifically on the sphere, for which we define a novel SW discrepancy, which we call spherical Sliced-Wasserstein, making a first step towards defining SW discrepancies on manifolds. Our construction is notably based on closed-form solutions of the Wasserstein distance on the circle, together with a new spherical Radon transform. Along with efficient algorithms and the corresponding implementations, we illustrate its properties in several machine learning use cases where spherical representations of data are at stake: sampling on the sphere, density estimation on real earth data or hyperspherical auto-encoders.},

However, like other models, they are prone to picking up confounders and shortcuts from the data, thus suffering from compromised prediction accuracy and limited generalization. We propose ProtoPDebug, an effective concept-level debugger for ProtoPNets in which a human supervisor, guided by the model's explanations, supplies feedback in the form of what part-prototypes must be forgotten or kept, and the model is fine-tuned to align with this supervision. Our experimental evaluation shows that ProtoPDebug outperforms state-of-the-art debuggers for a fraction of the annotation cost. An online experiment with laypeople confirms the simplicity of the feedback requested to the users and the effectiveness of the collected feedback for learning confounder-free part-prototypes. ProtoPDebug is a promising tool for trustworthy interactive learning in critical applications, as suggested by a preliminary evaluation on a medical decision making task.},

  abstract     = {Graph Neural Networks usually rely on the assumption that the graph topology is available to the network as well as optimal for the downstream task. Latent graph inference allows models to dynamically learn the intrinsic graph structure of problems where the connectivity patterns of data may not be directly accessible. In this work, we generalize the discrete Differentiable Graph Module (dDGM) for latent graph learning. The original dDGM architecture used the Euclidean plane to encode latent features based on which the latent graphs were generated. By incorporating Riemannian geometry into the model and generating more complex embedding spaces, we can improve the performance of the latent graph inference system. In particular, we propose a computationally tractable approach to produce product manifolds of constant curvature model spaces that can encode latent features of varying structure. The latent representations mapped onto the inferred product manifold are used to compute richer similarity measures that are leveraged by the latent graph learning model to obtain optimized latent graphs. Moreover, the curvature of the product manifold is learned during training alongside the rest of the network parameters and based on the downstream task, rather than it being a static embedding space. Our novel approach is tested on a wide range of datasets, and outperforms the original dDGM model.},

  abstract     = {It is unclear how changing the learning rule of a deep neural network alters its learning dynamics and representations. To gain insight into the relationship between learned features, function approximation, and the learning rule, we analyze infinite-width deep networks trained with gradient descent (GD) and biologically-plausible alternatives including feedback alignment (FA), direct feedback alignment (DFA), and error modulated Hebbian learning (Hebb), as well as gated linear networks (GLN). We show that, for each of these learning rules, the evolution of the output function at infinite width is governed by a time varying effective neural tangent kernel (eNTK). In the lazy training limit, this eNTK is static and does not evolve, while in the rich mean-field regime this kernel's evolution can be determined self-consistently with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). This DMFT enables comparisons of the feature and prediction dynamics induced by each of these learning rules. In the lazy limit, we find that DFA and Hebb can only learn using the last layer features, while full FA can utilize earlier layers with a scale determined by the initial correlation between feedforward and feedback weight matrices. In the rich regime, DFA and FA utilize a temporally evolving and depth-dependent NTK. Counterintuitively, we find that FA networks trained in the rich regime exhibit more feature learning if initialized with smaller correlation between the forward and backward pass weights. GLNs admit a very simple formula for their lazy limit kernel and preserve conditional Gaussianity of their preactivations under gating functions. Error modulated Hebb rules show very small task-relevant alignment of their kernels and perform most task relevant learning in the last layer.},

However, the generation of synthetic samples with the original data's characteristics remains a significant challenge for tabular data. While many generative models from the computer vision domain, such as variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks, have been adapted for tabular data generation, less research has been directed towards recent transformer-based large language models (LLMs), which are also generative in nature. To this end, we propose GReaT (Generation of Realistic Tabular data), which exploits an auto-regressive generative LLM to sample synthetic and yet highly realistic tabular data. Furthermore, GReaT can model tabular data distributions by conditioning on any subset of features; the remaining features are sampled without additional overhead. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a series of experiments that quantify the validity and quality of the produced data samples from multiple angles. We find that GReaT maintains state-of-the-art performance across numerous real-world and synthetic data sets with heterogeneous feature types coming in various sizes.},

It formalizes Occam's Razor and can be applied to data from non-stationary sources. In the prequential formulation of MDL, the objective is to minimize the cumulative next-step log-loss when sequentially going through the data and using previous observations for parameter estimation. It thus closely resembles a continual- or online-learning problem. In this study, we evaluate approaches for computing prequential description lengths for image classification datasets with neural networks. Considering the computational cost, we find that online-learning with rehearsal has favorable performance compared to the previously widely used block-wise estimation. We propose forward-calibration to better align the models predictions with the empirical observations and introduce replay-streams, a minibatch incremental training technique to efficiently implement approximate random replay while avoiding large in-memory replay buffers. As a result, we present description lengths for a suite of image classification datasets that improve upon previously reported results by large margins.},

In this work, we propose SWIFT: a novel wait-free decentralized FL algorithm that allows clients to conduct training at their own speed. Theoretically, we prove that SWIFT matches the gold-standard iteration convergence rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ of parallel SGD for convex and non-convex smooth optimization. We also provide theoretical results for both iid and non-iid settings without any bounded-delay assumption for slow clients, which is required by other asynchronous decentralized FL algorithms. Empirically, we demonstrate that SWIFT's asynchronous training reduces the wall-clock training time by an order of magnitude compared to synchronous counterparts and reaches target loss values upwards of 50\% faster than existing SOTA algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Learning from large amounts of unsupervised data and a small amount of supervision is an important open problem in computer vision. We propose a new semi-supervised learning method, Semantic Positives via Pseudo-Labels (SemPPL), that combines labelled and unlabelled data to learn informative representations. Our method extends self-supervised contrastive learning -- where representations are shaped by learning to contrast generated augmentations -- with a novel approach to selecting positives. To enrich the set of positives, we leverage the few existing ground-truth labels to predict the missing ones through a $k$-nearest neighbours classifier by using the learned embeddings of the labelled data. We thus extend the set of positives with datapoints having the same pseudo-label, which we call ``semantic positives''. We jointly learn representations and predict bootstrapped pseudo-labels, creating a reinforcing cycle. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance of 68.5\% and 76\% top-1 accuracy when using a ResNet-50 and training on 1\% and 10\% of labels on ImageNet, respectively. When using selective kernels, SemPPL significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art achieving 72.3\% and 78.3\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 1\% and 10\% labels respectively. Lastly, SemPPL is beneficial across image classification datasets, achieving significant improvements on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.},

For dense problems such as object detection, learning local rather than global information has proven more efficient. However, popular contrastive learning methods require large batch sizes and therefore significant resources. To address this problem, we focus on Transformer-based object detectors that recently gained attraction in the community with good performance and the particularity of generating many diverse object proposals. We present Proposal Selection Contrast (ProSeCo), a novel unsupervised end-to-end pretraining approach that leverages the large number of object proposals generated by the detector for contrastive learning, which allows the use of a smaller batch size, combined with object-level features to learn local information in the images. To improve the effectiveness of the contrastive loss, we introduce object location information in the selection of positive examples to take into account multiple overlapping object proposals. When reusing pretrained backbones, we advocate for consistency in learning local information between the backbone and the detection head. We show that ProSeCo outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in unsupervised pretraining for object detection on standard and novel benchmarks in learning with fewer data.},

Most prior attempts at this problem proposed neural networks that implement independent component analysis (ICA) which works under the limitation that latent causes are mutually independent. Here, we relax this limitation and propose a biologically plausible neural network that extracts correlated latent sources by exploiting information about their domains. Specifically, we choose maximum correlative information transfer from inputs to outputs as the separation objective under the constraint that the outputs are restricted to their presumed sets. We show that this objective leads to a novel neural network with plausible properties and an intuitive representation learning interpretation. The resulting separation algorithm can be adapted to infinitely many source domain choices. We demonstrate this capability with numerical examples of correlated sources in both synthetic and natural data settings.},

Due to the computationally expensive nature of their standard solution methods, neural PDE surrogates have become an active research topic to accelerate these simulations. However, current methods do not explicitly take into account the relationship between different fields and their internal components, which are often correlated. Viewing the time evolution of such correlated fields through the lens of multivector fields allows us to overcome these limitations. Multivector fields consist of scalar, vector, as well as higher-order components, such as bivectors and trivectors. Their algebraic properties, such as multiplication, addition and other arithmetic operations can be described by Clifford algebras. To our knowledge, this is the first usage of such multivector representations together with Clifford convolutions and Clifford Fourier transforms in the context of deep learning. We empirically evaluate the benefit of Clifford neural layers by replacing convolution and Fourier operations in common neural PDE surrogates by their Clifford counterparts on 2D Navier-Stokes and weather modeling tasks, as well as 3D Maxwell equations. For similar parameter count, Clifford neural layers consistently improve generalization capabilities of the tested neural PDE surrogates.},

Several works have focused on altering the reconstruction term of the evidence lower bound (ELBO), however, often at the expense of losing the mathematical link to maximizing the likelihood of the samples under the modeled distribution. Here we propose a new formulation of the reconstruction term for the VAE that specifically penalizes the generation of blurry images while at the same time still maximizing the ELBO under the modeled distribution. We show the potential of the proposed loss on three different data sets, where it outperforms several recently proposed reconstruction losses for VAEs.},

This formulation enforces long-range memory and preserves a global representation of the underlying dynamical system.

This success would be impossible if there was no hidden low-dimensional structure in data of interest; this existence is posited by the manifold hypothesis, which states that the data lies on an unknown manifold of low intrinsic dimension. In this paper, we argue that this hypothesis does not properly capture the low-dimensional structure typically present in image data. Assuming that data lies on a single manifold implies intrinsic dimension is identical across the entire data space, and does not allow for subregions of this space to have a different number of factors of variation. To address this deficiency, we consider the union of manifolds hypothesis, which states that data lies on a disjoint union of manifolds of varying intrinsic dimensions. We empirically verify this hypothesis on commonly-used image datasets, finding that observed data lies on a disconnected set and that intrinsic dimension is not constant. We further observe that classes with higher intrinsic dimensions are harder to classify. Additionally, we provide insights into the implications of the union of manifolds hypothesis in deep learning, both supervised and unsupervised, showing that designing models with an inductive bias for this structure improves performance across classification and generative modelling tasks.},

In this work, we instead propose to change how {CNPs} are deployed at test time, without any modifications to the model or training procedure. Instead of making predictions independently for every target point, we autoregressively define a joint predictive distribution using the chain rule of probability, taking inspiration from the neural autoregressive density estimator ({NADE}) literature.

How many stable, sufficiently-attracting memory patterns can we store in such a network using {$N$} neurons? The answer depends on the choice of weights and update rule. Inspired by setwise connectivity in biology, we extend Hopfield networks by adding setwise connections and embedding these connections in a simplicial complex. Simplicial complexes are higher dimensional analogues of graphs which naturally represent collections of pairwise and setwise relationships. We show that our simplicial Hopfield networks increase memory storage capacity. Surprisingly, even when connections are limited to a small random subset of equivalent size to an all-pairwise network, our networks still outperform their pairwise counterparts. Such scenarios include non-trivial simplicial topology. We also test analogous modern continuous Hopfield networks, offering a potentially promising avenue for improving the attention mechanism in Transformer models.},

Specifically, we introduce a method for accurately answering yes-no questions given only unlabeled model activations. It works by finding a direction in activation space that satisfies logical consistency properties, such as that a statement and its negation have opposite truth values. We show that despite using no supervision and no model outputs, our method can recover diverse knowledge represented in large language models: across 6 models and 10 question-answering datasets, it outperforms zero-shot accuracy by 4\% on average.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural network ({GNN}) is a powerful learning approach for graph-based recommender systems. Recently, {GNNs} integrated with contrastive learning have shown superior performance in recommendation with their data augmentation schemes, aiming at dealing with highly sparse data. Despite their success, most existing graph contrastive learning methods either perform stochastic augmentation (e.g., node/edge perturbation) on the user-item interaction graph, or rely on the heuristic-based augmentation techniques (e.g., user clustering) for generating contrastive views. We argue that these methods cannot well preserve the intrinsic semantic structures and are easily biased by the noise perturbation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective graph contrastive learning paradigm {LightGCL} that mitigates these issues impairing the generality and robustness of {CL}-based recommenders. The model exclusively utilizes singular value decomposition for contrastive augmentation, which enables the unconstrained structural refinement with global collaborative relation modeling. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the significant improvement in performance of our model over the state-of-the-arts. Further analyses demonstrate the superiority of {LightGCL}'s robustness against data sparsity and popularity bias.},

  abstract     = {The universal approximation property ({UAP}) of neural networks is fundamental for deep learning, and it is well known that wide neural networks are universal approximators of continuous functions within both the $L^p$ norm and the continuous/uniform norm. However, the exact minimum width, $w_{\min}$, for the {UAP} has not been studied thoroughly. Recently, using a decoder-memorizer-encoder scheme, \citet{Park2021Minimum} found that $w_{\min} = \max(d_x+1,d_y)$ for both the $L^p$-{UAP} of {ReLU} networks and the $C$-{UAP} of {ReLU}+{STEP} networks, where $d_x,d_y$ are the input and output dimensions, respectively. In this paper, we consider neural networks with an arbitrary set of activation functions. We prove that both $C$-{UAP} and $L^p$-{UAP} for functions on compact domains share a universal lower bound of the minimal width; that is, $w^*_{\min} = \max(d_x,d_y)$. In particular, the critical width, $w^*_{\min}$, for $L^p$-{UAP} can be achieved by leaky-{ReLU} networks, provided that the input or output dimension is larger than one. Our construction is based on the approximation power of neural ordinary differential equations and the ability to approximate flow maps by neural networks. The nonmonotone or discontinuous activation functions case and the one-dimensional case are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {In many real-world imitation learning tasks, the demonstrator and the learner have to act under different observation spaces. This situation brings significant obstacles to existing imitation learning approaches, since most of them learn policies under homogeneous observation spaces. On the other hand, previous studies under different observation spaces have strong assumptions that these two observation spaces coexist during the entire learning process. However, in reality, the observation coexistence will be limited due to the high cost of acquiring expert observations. In this work, we study this challenging problem with limited observation coexistence under heterogeneous observations: Heterogeneously Observable Imitation Learning ({HOIL}). We identify two underlying issues in {HOIL}: the dynamics mismatch and the support mismatch, and further propose the Importance Weighting with {REjection} ({IWRE}) algorithm based on importance weighting and learning with rejection to solve {HOIL} problems. Experimental results show that {IWRE} can solve various {HOIL} tasks, including the challenging tasks of transforming the vision-based demonstrations to random access memory ({RAM})-based policies in the Atari domain, even with limited visual observations.},

However, their performance degrades considerably when applied to out-of-domain data, making robust cross-domain performance critical for scalable {IR} systems. In this paper, we propose {HypeR}, a hyper-prompted training mechanism to enable uniform retrieval across tasks of different domains. Our approach jointly trains the query encoder with a shared prompt-based parameter pool and a prompt synthesizer that dynamically composes hyper-prompt for encoding each query from different tasks or domains. To prevent mode collapse of prompt attention distribution for different queries, we design a contrastive prompt regularization that promotes the mode of prompt attention to be aligned and uniform. Through multi-task hyper-prompted training, our retriever can master the ability to dynamically represent different types of queries and transfer knowledge across different domains and tasks. Extensive experiments show our model attains better retrieval performance across different tasks and better zero-shot transfer ability compared with various previous methods.},

The main body of {RevCol} is composed of multiple copies of subnetworks, named columns respectively, between which multi-level reversible connections are employed. Such architectural scheme attributes {RevCol} very different behavior from conventional networks: during forward propagation, features in {RevCol} are learned to be gradually disentangled when passing through each column, whose total information is maintained rather than compressed or discarded as other network does. Our experiments suggest that {CNN}-style {RevCol} models can achieve very competitive performances on multiple computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation, especially with large parameter budget and large dataset. For example, after {ImageNet}-22K pre-training, {RevCol}-{XL} obtains 88.2\% {ImageNet}-1K accuracy. Given more pre-training data, our largest model {RevCol}-H reaches 90.0\% on {ImageNet}-1K, 63.8\% {AP}$_{box}$ on {COCO} detection minival set, 61.0\% {mIoU} on {ADE20k} segmentation.

  abstract     = {With adversarial or otherwise normal prompts, existing large language models (LLM) can be pushed to generate toxic discourses. One way to reduce the risk of LLMs generating undesired discourses is to alter the training of the LLM. This can be very restrictive due to demanding computation requirements. Other methods rely on rule-based or prompt-based token elimination, which are limited as they dismiss future tokens and the overall meaning of the complete discourse. Here, we center detoxification on the probability that the finished discourse is ultimately considered toxic. That is, at each point, we advise against token selections proportional to how likely a finished text from this point will be toxic. To this end, we formally extend the dead-end theory from the recent reinforcement learning (RL) literature to also cover uncertain outcomes. Our approach, called rectification, utilizes a separate but significantly smaller model for detoxification, which can be applied to diverse LLMs as long as they share the same vocabulary. Importantly, our method does not require access to the internal representations of the LLM, but only the token probability distribution at each decoding step. We believe this is important since many LLMs today are hosted in servers and only accessible through APIs. When applied to various LLMs, including GPT-3, our approach generates notably better results compared to the base LLMs and other techniques in terms of the overall language and detoxification performance.},

However, most present AutoML techniques consider each task independently from scratch, which requires exploring many architectures, leading to high computational cost. Here we propose AutoTransfer, an AutoML solution that improves search efficiency by transferring the prior architectural design knowledge to the novel task of interest. Our key innovation includes a task-model bank that captures the model performance over a diverse set of GNN architectures and tasks, and a computationally efficient task embedding that can accurately measure the similarity among different tasks. Based on the task-model bank and the task embeddings, we estimate the design priors of desirable models of the novel task, by aggregating a similarity-weighted sum of the top-K design distributions on tasks that are similar to the task of interest. The computed design priors can be used with any AutoML search algorithm. We evaluate AutoTransfer on six datasets in the graph machine learning domain. Experiments demonstrate that (i) our proposed task embedding can be computed efficiently, and that tasks with similar embeddings have similar best-performing architectures; (ii) AutoTransfer significantly improves search efficiency with the transferred design priors, reducing the number of explored architectures by an order of magnitude. Finally, we release GNN-Bank-101, a large-scale dataset of detailed GNN training information of 120,000 task-model combinations to facilitate and inspire future research.},

This is undesirable because memorization violates privacy (exposing user data), degrades utility (repeated easy-to-memorize text is often low quality), and hurts fairness (some texts are memorized over others). We describe three log-linear relationships that quantify the degree to which LMs emit memorized training data. Memorization significantly grows as we increase (1) the capacity of a model, (2) the number of times an example has been duplicated, and (3) the number of tokens of context used to prompt the model. Surprisingly, we find the situation becomes complicated when generalizing these results across model families. On the whole, we find that memorization in LMs is more prevalent than previously believed and will likely get worse as models continues to scale, at least without active mitigations.},

However, to be effective this approach requires state features that are useful to predict, and these state-features are typically hand-designed.

While there has been substantial progress on understanding the global convergence of policy optimization methods in single-agent RL, designing and analysis of efficient policy optimization algorithms in the MARL setting present significant challenges, which unfortunately, remain highly inadequately addressed by existing theory. In this paper, we focus on the most basic setting of competitive multi-agent RL, namely two-player zero-sum Markov games, and study equilibrium finding algorithms in both the infinite-horizon discounted setting and the finite-horizon episodic setting. We propose a single-loop policy optimization method with symmetric updates from both agents, where the policy is updated via the entropy-regularized optimistic multiplicative weights update (OMWU) method and the value is updated on a slower timescale. In the full-information tabular setting, the proposed method achieves a finite-time last-iterate linear convergence to the quantal response equilibrium of the regularized problem, which translates to a sublinear last-iterate convergence to the Nash equilibrium by controlling the amount of regularization. Our convergence results improve upon the best known iteration complexities, and lead to a better understanding of policy optimization in competitive Markov games.},

Recently, Unified Open-set Recognition (UOSR) has been proposed to reject not only unknown samples but also known but wrongly classified samples, which tends to be more practical in real-world applications. In this paper, we deeply analyze the UOSR task under different training and evaluation settings and show that the uncertainty distribution of almost all existing OSR methods is actually closer to the expectation of UOSR than OSR. The reason lies in the known but wrongly classified samples, as their uncertainty distribution is extremely close to unknown samples rather than known and correctly classified samples. Based on this finding, we further analyze and compare different training procedures and find that pre-training is helpful for identifying known but wrongly classified samples while outlier exposure is not. Furthermore, we formulate a new evaluation setting called few-shot UOSR, where only one or five samples per unknown class are available during evaluation, and propose FS-KNNS for the few-shot UOSR to achieve state-of-the-art performance.},

Sequential decision-making requires reasoning about the possible future consequences of current behavior. Consequently, capturing the relationship between key evolving features for a given task is conducive to recovering effective policies. To this end, hyperbolic geometry provides deep RL models with a natural basis to precisely encode this inherently hierarchical information. However, applying existing methodologies from the hyperbolic deep learning literature leads to fatal optimization instabilities due to the non-stationarity and variance characterizing RL gradient estimators. Hence, we design a new general method that counteracts such optimization challenges and enables stable end-to-end learning with deep hyperbolic representations. We empirically validate our framework by applying it to popular on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms on the Procgen and Atari 100K benchmarks, attaining near universal performance and generalization benefits. Given its natural fit, we hope future RL research will consider hyperbolic representations as a standard tool.},

In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective framework for anytime domain adaptation that is executable with dynamic resource constraints to achieve accuracy-efficiency trade-offs under domain-shifts. We achieve this by training a single shared network using both labeled source and unlabeled target data, with switchable depth, width and input resolutions on the fly to enable testing under a wide range of computation budgets. Starting with a teacher network trained from a label-rich source domain, we utilize bootstrapped recursive knowledge distillation as a nexus between source and target domains to jointly train the student network with switchable subnetworks. Through extensive experiments on 4 benchmark datasets, we show that AnyDA achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods, more significantly at lower computation budgets.},

  abstract     = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training neural policies to solve complex control tasks. However, these policies tend to be overfit to the exact specifications of the task and environment they were trained on, and thus do not perform well when conditions deviate slightly or when composed hierarchically to solve even more complex tasks. Recent work has shown that training a mixture of policies, as opposed to a single one, that are driven to explore different regions of the state-action space can address this shortcoming by generating a diverse set of behaviors, referred to as skills, that can be collectively used to great effect in adaptation tasks or for hierarchical planning. This is typically realized by including a diversity term - often derived from information theory - in the objective function optimized by RL. However these approaches often require careful hyperparameter tuning to be effective. In this work, we demonstrate that less widely-used neuroevolution methods, specifically Quality Diversity (QD), are a competitive alternative to information-theory-augmented RL for skill discovery. Through an extensive empirical evaluation comparing eight state-of-the-art algorithms (four flagship algorithms from each line of work) on the basis of (i) metrics directly evaluating the skills' diversity, (ii) the skills' performance on adaptation tasks, and (iii) the skills' performance when used as primitives for hierarchical planning; QD methods are found to provide equal, and sometimes improved, performance whilst being less sensitive to hyperparameters and more scalable. As no single method is found to provide near-optimal performance across all environments, there is a rich scope for further research which we support by proposing future directions and providing optimized open-source implementations.},

  abstract     = {Many Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) perform poorly compared to simple heuristics on Link Prediction (LP) tasks. This is due to limitations in expressive power such as the inability to count triangles (the backbone of most LP heuristics) and because they can not distinguish automorphic nodes (those having identical structural roles). Both expressiveness issues can be alleviated by learning link (rather than node) representations and incorporating structural features such as triangle counts. Since explicit link representations are often prohibitively expensive, recent works resorted to subgraph-based methods, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance for LP, but suffer from poor efficiency due to high levels of redundancy between subgraphs. We analyze the components of subgraph GNN (SGNN) methods for link prediction. Based on our analysis, we propose a novel full-graph GNN called ELPH (Efficient Link Prediction with Hashing) that passes subgraph sketches as messages to approximate the key components of SGNNs without explicit subgraph construction. ELPH is provably more expressive than Message Passing GNNs (MPNNs). It outperforms existing SGNN models on many standard LP benchmarks while being orders of magnitude faster. However, it shares the common GNN limitation that it is only efficient when the dataset fits in GPU memory. Accordingly, we develop a highly scalable model, called BUDDY, which uses feature precomputation to circumvent this limitation without sacrificing predictive performance. Our experiments show that BUDDY also outperforms SGNNs on standard LP benchmarks while being highly scalable and faster than ELPH.},

However, recent studies reveal that text-to-SQL models are vulnerable to task-specific perturbations. Previous curated robustness test sets usually focus on individual phenomena. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive robustness benchmark based on Spider, a cross-domain text-to-SQL benchmark, to diagnose the model robustness. We design 17 perturbations on databases, natural language questions, and SQL queries to measure the robustness from different angles. To collect more diversified natural question perturbations, we utilize large pretrained language models (PLMs) to simulate human behaviors in creating natural questions. Our experimental results reveal that even the most robust model suffers from a 14.0\% performance drop overall and a 50.7\% performance drop on the most challenging perturbation.},

  abstract     = {In streaming settings, speech recognition models have to map sub-sequences of speech to text before the full audio stream becomes available. However, since alignment information between speech and text is rarely available during training, models need to learn it in a completely self-supervised way. In practice, the exponential number of possible alignments makes this extremely challenging, with models often learning peaky or sub-optimal alignments. Prima facie, the exponential nature of the alignment space makes it difficult to even quantify the uncertainty of a model's alignment distribution. Fortunately, it has been known for decades that the entropy of a probabilistic finite state transducer can be computed in time linear to the size of the transducer via a dynamic programming reduction based on semirings. In this work, we revisit the entropy semiring for neural speech recognition models, and show how alignment entropy can be used to supervise models through regularization or distillation. We also contribute an open-source implementation of CTC and RNN-T in the semiring framework that includes numerically stable and highly parallel variants of the entropy semiring. Empirically, we observe that the addition of alignment distillation improves the accuracy and latency of an already well-optimized teacher-student distillation model, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Librispeech dataset in the streaming scenario.},

The bias of a few parties against under-represented groups (identified by sensitive attributes such as gender or race) can propagate through the network to all parties in the network. We analyze and explain the source of bias propagation in federated learning. Our analysis reveals that biased parties unintentionally yet stealthily encode their bias in a small number of model parameters, and throughout the training, they steadily increase the dependence of the global model on sensitive attributes. What is important to highlight is that the experienced bias in federated learning is higher than what parties would otherwise encounter in centralized training with a model trained on the union of all their data, indicating that this bias is intrinsic to the federated learning algorithm itself. This underlines the critical necessity for auditing group fairness in federated learning and designing robust algorithms against bias propagation.},

Existing methods for machine learning on temporal networks generally exhibit at least one of two limitations: (1) time is discretized, so if the time data is continuous, the user must determine the discretization and discard precise time information, or (2) edge representations can only be calculated indirectly from the nodes, which may be suboptimal for tasks like edge classification. We present a simple method that avoids both shortcomings: construct the line graph of the network, which includes a node for each interaction, and weigh the edges of this graph based on the difference in time between interactions. From this derived graph, edge representations for the original network can be computed with efficient classical methods. The simplicity of this approach facilitates explicit theoretical analysis: we can constructively show the effectiveness of our method's representations for a natural synthetic model of temporal networks. Empirical results on real-world networks demonstrate the method's efficacy and efficiency on both edge classification and temporal link prediction.},

However, current approaches to learning diverse cooperative behaviors typically focus on the concept of population diversity or novelty, which do not directly translate to behaviorally diverse cooperative agents. We propose to learn diverse behaviors via policy compatibility, which conceptually measures whether policies of interest can coordinate effectively. We theoretically show that incompatible policies are not similar. Thus, policy compatibility—which has been used exclusively as a measure of robustness—can be used as a proxy for learning diverse behaviors. We incorporate the proposed objective into a population-based training scheme to allow concurrent training of multiple agents. Additionally, we use state-action information to induce local variations of each policy. Empirically, the proposed method consistently discovers more solutions than baseline methods across various multi-goal cooperative environments. Finally, in multi-recipe Overcooked, we show that our method produces populations of behaviorally diverse agents, which enables generalist agents trained with such a population to be more robust.},

  abstract     = {There is a growing interest in the machine learning community in developing predictive algorithms that are ``interpretable by design''. Towards this end, recent work proposes to make interpretable decisions by sequentially asking interpretable queries about data until a prediction can be made with high confidence based on the answers obtained (the history). To promote short query-answer chains, a greedy procedure called Information Pursuit (IP) is used, which adaptively chooses queries in order of information gain. Generative models are employed to learn the distribution of query-answers and labels, which is in turn used to estimate the most informative query. However, learning and inference with a full generative model of the data is often intractable for complex tasks. In this work, we propose Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP), a variational characterization of IP which bypasses the need for learning generative models. Empirically, V-IP is 10-100x faster than IP on different Vision and NLP tasks with competitive performance. Moreover, V-IP finds much shorter query chains when compared to reinforcement learning which is typically used in sequential-decision-making problems. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of V-IP on challenging tasks like medical diagnosis where the performance is far superior to the generative modelling approach.},

Our method consists of a novel SE(3)-equivariant coordinate-based network (TF-ONet), that parametrizes the occupancy field of the shape and respects the inherent symmetries of the problem. In contrast to previous shape reconstruction methods that align the input to a regular grid, we operate directly on the irregular point cloud. Our architecture leverages equivariant attention layers that operate on local tokens. This mechanism enables local shape modelling, a crucial property for scalability to large scenes. Given an unoriented, sparse, noisy point cloud as input, we produce equivariant features for each point. These serve as keys and values for the subsequent equivariant cross-attention blocks that parametrize the occupancy field. By querying an arbitrary point in space, we predict its occupancy score. We show that our method outperforms previous SO(3)-equivariant methods, as well as non-equivariant methods trained on SO(3)-augmented datasets. More importantly, local modelling together with SE(3)-equivariance create an ideal setting for SE(3) scene reconstruction. We show that by training only on single, aligned objects and without any pre-segmentation, we can reconstruct novel scenes containing arbitrarily many objects in random poses without any performance loss.},

  abstract     = {Contrastive self-supervised learning methods famously produce high quality transferable representations by learning invariances to different data augmentations. Invariances established during pre-training can be interpreted as strong inductive biases. However these may or may not be helpful, depending on if they match the invariance requirements of downstream tasks or not. This has led to several attempts to learn task-specific invariances during pre-training, however, these methods are highly compute intensive and tedious to train. We introduce the notion of amortized invariance learning for contrastive self supervision. In the pre-training stage, we parameterize the feature extractor by differentiable invariance hyper-parameters that control the invariances encoded by the representation. Then, for any downstream task, both linear readout and task-specific invariance requirements can be efficiently and effectively learned by gradient-descent. We evaluate the notion of amortized invariances for contrastive learning over two different modalities: vision and audio, on two widely-used contrastive learning methods in vision: SimCLR and MoCo-v2 with popular architectures like ResNets and Vision Transformers, and SimCLR with ResNet-18 for audio. We show that our amortized features provide a reliable way to learn diverse downstream tasks with different invariance requirements, while using a single feature and avoiding task-specific pre-training. This provides an exciting perspective that opens up new horizons in the field of general purpose representation learning.},

In this paper, we propose the first weakly-supervised {VidSGG} task with only single-frame weak supervision: {SF}-{VidSGG}. By ``weakly-supervised'', we mean that {SF}-{VidSGG} relaxes the training supervision from two different levels: 1) It only provides single-frame annotations instead of all-frame annotations. 2) The single-frame ground-truth annotation is still a weak image {SGG} annotation, i.e., an unlocalized scene graph. To solve this new task, we also propose a novel Pseudo Label Assignment based method, dubbed as {PLA}. {PLA} is a two-stage method, which generates pseudo visual relation annotations for the given video at the first stage, and then trains a fully-supervised {VidSGG} model with these pseudo labels. Extensive ablations and results on the benchmark Action Genome have demonstrated the effectiveness of our {PLA} method.},

To train {PaLI}, we make use of large pretrained encoder-decoder language models and Vision Transformers ({ViTs}).

Since existing Transformers for language are much larger than their vision counterparts, we train a large, 4-billion parameter {ViT} ({ViT}-e) to quantify the benefits from even larger-capacity vision models.

Across multiple visual recognition benchmarks, we found that pre-training can not only improve {FL}, but also close its accuracy gap to the counterpart centralized learning, especially in the challenging cases of non-{IID} clients' data. To make our findings applicable to situations where pre-trained models are not directly available, we explore pre-training with synthetic data or even with clients' data in a decentralized manner, and found that they can already improve {FL} notably. Interestingly, many of the techniques we explore are complementary to each other to further boost the performance, and we view this as a critical result toward scaling up deep {FL} for real-world applications. We conclude our paper with an attempt to understand the effect of pre-training on {FL}. We found that pre-training enables the learned global models under different clients' data conditions to converge to the same loss basin, and makes global aggregation in {FL} more stable. Nevertheless, pre-training seems to not alleviate local model drifting, a fundamental problem in {FL} under non-{IID} data.},

We make the simple observation that many well-studied subclasses of {POMDPs} with polynomial sample complexity share a common property: they all admit a low-rank structure in their Predictive State Representations ({PSRs}). Motivated by this observation, we introduce the notion of B-stability: a natural and unified structural condition for {PSRs} that encompasses the vast majority of known tractable {POMDP} subclasses. We show that any B-stable {PSR} can be learned with polynomial samples in relevant problem parameters. Our result is achieved by three algorithms simultaneously: Optimistic Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Estimation-to-Decisions, and Model-Based Optimistic Posterior Sampling -- with the latter two being new for sample-efficient learning of {POMDPs}/{PSRs}. The sample complexities we obtain substantially improve over existing results for many well-studied subclasses.},

In this work, we show that due to the limited distributional expressivity of policy models, previous methods might still select unseen actions during training, which deviates from their initial motivation. To address this problem, we adopt a generative approach by decoupling the learned policy into two parts: an expressive generative behavior model and an action evaluation model. The key insight is that such decoupling avoids learning an explicitly parameterized policy model with a closed-form expression. Instead, we use a generative model to sample actions from the behavior distribution and use a separate model to select from these actions. We instantiate our framework with a diffusion-based generative model and name our method SfBC (Selecting from Behavior Candidates). Experimental results show SfBC achieves competitive performance on standard {D4RL} tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods on tasks that demand distributional expressivity.},

  abstract     = {Transformer architectures have achieved great success in solving natural language tasks, which learn strong language representations from large-scale unlabeled texts. In this paper, we seek to go further beyond and explore a new logical inductive bias for better language representation learning. Logic reasoning is known as a formal methodology to reach answers from given knowledge and facts. Inspired by such a view, we develop a novel neural architecture named {FOLNet} (First-Order Logic Network), to encode this new inductive bias. We construct a set of neural logic operators as learnable Horn clauses, which are further forward-chained into a fully differentiable neural architecture ({FOLNet}). Interestingly, we find that the self-attention module in transformers can be composed by two of our neural logic operators, which probably explains their strong reasoning performance. Experimental results on several language understanding tasks show that the pretrained {FOLNet} model outperforms the existing strong transformer-based approaches and learns language representations that have much stronger transfer capabilities.},

In contrast to prior works, their results: (1) hold for an {L}²-accurate score estimate (rather than {L}∞-accurate); (2) do not require restrictive functional inequality conditions that preclude substantial non-log-concavity; (3) scale polynomially in all relevant problem parameters; and (4) match state-of-the-art complexity guarantees for discretization of the Langevin diffusion, provided that the score error is sufficiently small. The authors view this as strong theoretical justification for the empirical success of {SGMs}.},

However, the success of applying existing language models to planning, in which we wish to obtain a trajectory of actions to reach some goal, is less straightforward. The typical autoregressive generation procedures of language models preclude sequential refinement of earlier steps, which limits the effectiveness of a predicted plan. In this paper, we suggest an approach towards integrating planning with language models based on the idea of iterative energy minimization, and illustrate how such a procedure leads to improved RL performance across different tasks. We train a masked language model to capture an implicit energy function over trajectories of actions, and formulate planning as finding a trajectory of actions with minimum energy. We illustrate how this procedure enables improved performance over recent approaches across BabyAI and Atari environments. We further demonstrate unique benefits of our iterative optimization procedure, involving new task generalization, test-time constraints adaptation, and the ability to compose plans together.},

We present HotProtein, a large-scale protein dataset with growth temperature annotations of thermostability, containing 182K amino acid sequences and 3K folded structures from 230 different species with a wide temperature range -20°C∼120°C. Due to functional domain differences and data scarcity within each species, existing methods fail to generalize well on our dataset. We address this problem through a novel learning framework, consisting of (1) Protein structure-aware pre-training (SAP) which leverages 3D information to enhance sequence-based pre-training; (2) Factorized sparse tuning (FST) that utilizes low-rank and sparse priors as an implicit regularization, together with feature augmentations. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that our framework improves thermostability prediction compared to other deep learning models. Finally, we introduce a novel editing algorithm to efficiently generate positive amino acid mutations that improve thermostability.},

  abstract     = {The graph Transformer emerges as a new architecture and has shown superior performance on various graph mining tasks. In this work, we observe that existing graph Transformers treat nodes as independent tokens and construct a single long sequence composed of all node tokens so as to train the Transformer model, causing it hard to scale to large graphs due to the quadratic complexity on the number of nodes for the self-attention computation. To this end, we propose a Neighborhood Aggregation Graph Transformer (NAGphormer) that treats each node as a sequence containing a series of tokens constructed by our proposed Hop2Token module. For each node, Hop2Token aggregates the neighborhood features from different hops into different representations and thereby produces a sequence of token vectors as one input. In this way, NAGphormer could be trained in a mini-batch manner and thus could scale to large graphs. Moreover, we mathematically show that as compared to a category of advanced Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the decoupled Graph Convolutional Network, NAGphormer could learn more informative node representations from the multi-hop neighborhoods. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets from small to large are conducted to demonstrate that NAGphormer consistently outperforms existing graph Transformers and mainstream GNNs.},

We propose a unified graph signal sampling framework which enjoys the benefits of graph signal analysis and processing. The key idea is to transform each user's ratings on the items to a function (signal) on the vertices of an item-item graph, then learn structural graph properties to recover the function from its values on certain vertices -- the problem of graph signal sampling. We propose a class of regularization functionals that takes into account discrete random label noise in the graph vertex domain, then develop the GS-IMC approach which biases the reconstruction towards functions that vary little between adjacent vertices for noise reduction. Theoretical result shows that accurate reconstructions can be achieved under mild conditions. For the online setting, we develop a Bayesian extension, i.e., BGS-IMC which considers continuous random Gaussian noise in the graph Fourier domain and builds upon a prediction-correction update algorithm to obtain the unbiased and minimum-variance reconstruction. Both GS-IMC and BGS-IMC have closed-form solutions and thus are highly scalable in large data. Experiments show that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks.},

Prior work has explained the effectiveness of the skip connection mechanism from different perspectives. In this work, we deep dive into the model's behaviors with skip connections which can be formulated as a learnable Markov chain. An efficient Markov chain is preferred as it always maps the input data to the target domain in a better way. However, while a model is explained as a Markov chain, it is not guaranteed to be optimized following an efficient Markov chain by existing SGD-based optimizers prone to getting trapped in local optimal points. In order to move towards a more efficient Markov chain, we propose a simple routine of penal connection to make any residual-like model become a learnable Markov chain. Aside from that, the penal connection can also be viewed as a particular model regularization and can be easily implemented with one line of code in the most popular deep learning frameworks. The encouraging experimental results in multi-modal translation and image recognition empirically confirm our conjecture of the learnable Markov chain view and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed penal connection.},

Though state-of-the-art models can generate high-quality images of common entities, they often have difficulty generating images of uncommon entities, such as 'Chortai (dog)' or 'Picarones (food)'. To tackle this issue, we present the Retrieval-Augmented Text-to-Image Generator (Re-Imagen), a generative model that uses retrieved information to produce high-fidelity and faithful images, even for rare or unseen entities. Given a text prompt, Re-Imagen accesses an external multi-modal knowledge base to retrieve relevant (image, text) pairs and uses them as references to generate the image. With this retrieval step, Re-Imagen is augmented with the knowledge of high-level semantics and low-level visual details of the mentioned entities, and thus improves its accuracy in generating the entities' visual appearances. We train Re-Imagen on a constructed dataset containing (image, text, retrieval) triples to teach the model to ground on both text prompt and retrieval. Furthermore, we develop a new sampling strategy to interleave the classifier-free guidance for text and retrieval conditions to balance the text and retrieval alignment. Re-Imagen achieves significant gain on FID score over COCO and WikiImage. To further evaluate the capabilities of the model, we introduce EntityDrawBench, a new benchmark that evaluates image generation for diverse entities, from frequent to rare, across multiple object categories including dogs, foods, landmarks, birds, and characters. Human evaluation on EntityDrawBench shows that Re-Imagen can significantly improve the fidelity of generated images, especially on less frequent entities.},

In contrast to classical optimization methods like L-BFGS or projected gradient descent, we train the neural network to also stay close to the manifold of natural images throughout the optimization. We show that our learned neural optimization is faster and more reliable than classical optimization approaches. In comparison to previous state-of-the-art encoder-decoder-based steganography methods, it reduces the recovery error rate by multiple orders of magnitude and achieves zero error up to 3 bits per pixel (bpp) without the need for error-correcting codes.},

It replaces the scaled dot-product operation with a valid symmetric kernel and uses sparse Gaussian processes (SGP) techniques to approximate the posterior processes of MHA outputs. Empirically, on a suite of prediction tasks on text, images and graphs, SGPA-based Transformers achieve competitive predictive accuracy, while noticeably improving both in-distribution calibration and out-of-distribution robustness and detection.},

OTOv2 is automatic and pluggable into various deep learning applications, and requires almost minimal engineering efforts from the users. Methodologically, OTOv2 proposes two major improvements: (i) Autonomy: automatically exploits the dependency of general DNNs, partitions the trainable variables into Zero-Invariant Groups (ZIGs), and constructs the compressed model; and (ii) Dual Half-Space Projected Gradient (DHSPG): a novel optimizer to more reliably solve structured-sparsity problems. Numerically, we demonstrate the generality and autonomy of OTOv2 on a variety of model architectures such as VGG, ResNet, CARN, ConvNeXt, DenseNet and StackedUnets, the majority of which cannot be handled by other methods without extensive handcrafting efforts. Together with benchmark datasets including CIFAR10/100, DIV2K, Fashion-MNIST, SVNH and ImageNet, its effectiveness is validated by performing competitively or even better than the state-of-the-arts.},

Previous work often made predictions for records in a paradigm that processed each feature as an operating unit, which requires to well cope with the heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose to encapsulate all feature values of a record into vectorial features and process them collectively rather than have to deal with individual ones, which directly captures the representations at the data level and benefits robust performances. Specifically, we adopt the concept of `capsules' to organize features into vectorial features, and devise a novel capsule neural network called `TabCaps' to process the vectorial features for classification. In TabCaps, a record is encoded into several vectorial features by some optimizable multivariate Gaussian kernels in the primary capsule layer, where each vectorial feature represents a specific `profile' of the input record and is transformed into senior capsule layer under the guidance of a new straightforward routing algorithm. The design of routing algorithm is motivated by the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model, which performs capsule feature grouping straightforwardly and efficiently, in lieu of the computationally complex clustering of previous routing algorithms. Comprehensive experiments show that TabCaps achieves competitive and robust performances in tabular data classification tasks.},

In this paper, we propose a mathematically-grounded learned index framework with dynamic $\epsilon$, which is efficient and pluggable to existing learned index methods. We theoretically analyze prediction error bounds that link $\epsilon$ with data characteristics for an illustrative learned index method.

Pre-training the model on large-scale datasets and fine-tuning it on specific tasks has become a well-established paradigm in human-centric perception. Recently, self-supervised learning methods have re-investigated contrastive learning to achieve superior performance on various downstream tasks. When handling human-centric perception, there still remains untapped potential since 3D human structure information is neglected during the task-agnostic pre-training. In this paper, we propose the Lifting Contrastive Learning (LiftedCL) to obtain 3D-aware human-centric representations which absorb 3D human structure information. In particular, to induce the learning process, a set of 3D skeletons is randomly sampled by resorting to 3D human kinematic prior. With this set of generic 3D samples, 3D human structure information can be learned into 3D-aware representations through adversarial learning. Empirical results demonstrate that LiftedCL outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on four human-centric downstream tasks, including 2D and 3D human pose estimation (0.4\% mAP and 1.8 mm MPJPE improvement on COCO 2D pose estimation and Human3.6M 3D pose estimation), human shape recovery and human parsing.},

However, their inherent vulnerability to backdoor attacks due to the adoption of deep learning techniques is concerning. Existing backdoor attacks exclusively require modification of training inputs (e.g., images), which may be impractical in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose the first clean-image backdoor attack, which only poisons the training labels without touching the training samples. The key insight is that in a multi-label learning task, the adversary can just manipulate the annotations of training samples consisting of a specific set of classes to activate the backdoor. We also develop several innovative techniques including a novel trigger exploration method to find covert and effective triggers to enhance the attack performance, and three target label selection strategies to achieve different goals. Experimental results indicate that our clean-image backdoor can achieve a 98\% attack success rate while preserving the model's functionality on the benign inputs. Additionally, the proposed clean-image backdoor can evade existing state-of-the-art defenses.},

Under this framework, a new sample-efficient algorithm namely OPtimization-based ExploRation with Approximation (OPERA) is proposed, achieving regret bounds that match or improve over the best-known results for a variety of MDP models. In particular, for MDPs with low Witness rank, under a slightly stronger assumption, OPERA improves the state-of-the-art sample complexity results by a polynomial factor.},

  abstract     = {3D object detection from multiple image views is a fundamental and challenging task for visual scene understanding, with multi-view 3D object detection demonstrating promising application prospects due to its low cost and high efficiency. However, accurately detecting objects through perspective views is extremely difficult due to the lack of depth information. Different from images, LiDAR points are superior in providing spatial cues, resulting in highly precise localization. In this paper, we propose BEVDistill, a cross-modal BEV knowledge distillation (KD) framework for multi-view 3D object detection. Instead of directly training a depth prediction network, we unify the image and LiDAR features in the Bird-Eye-View (BEV) space and adaptively transfer knowledge across non-homogenous representations in a teacher-student paradigm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current KD approaches on a highly-competitive baseline, BEVFormer, without introducing any extra cost in the inference phase. Our best model achieves 59.4 NDS on the nuScenes test leaderboard, achieving new state-of-the-art compared to various image-based detectors.},

  abstract     = {Soft threshold pruning is among the cutting-edge pruning methods with state-of-the-art performance. However, previous methods either perform aimless searching on the threshold scheduler or simply set the threshold trainable, lacking theoretical explanation from a unified perspective. In this work, we reformulate soft threshold pruning as an implicit optimization problem solved using the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA), a classic method from the fields of sparse recovery and compressed sensing. Under this theoretical framework, all threshold tuning strategies proposed in previous studies of soft threshold pruning are concluded as different styles of tuning $L_1$-regularization term. We further derive an optimal threshold scheduler through an in-depth study of threshold scheduling based on our framework. This scheduler keeps $L_1$-regularization coefficient stable, implying a time-invariant objective function from the perspective of optimization. In principle, the derived pruning algorithm could sparsify any mathematical model trained via SGD. We conduct extensive experiments and verify its state-of-the-art performance on both Artificial Neural Networks (ResNet-50 and MobileNet-V1) and Spiking Neural Networks (SEW ResNet-18) on ImageNet datasets.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised representation learning on outdoor-scene point clouds remains challenging because previous methods need to reconstruct the whole scene and capture partial views for the contrastive objective. This is infeasible in outdoor scenes with moving objects, obstacles, and sensors. In this paper, we propose CO3, namely Cooperative Contrastive Learning and Contextual Shape Prediction, to learn 3D representation for outdoor-scene point clouds in an unsupervised manner. It utilizes LiDAR point clouds from vehicle-side and infrastructure-side to build views that differ enough but meanwhile maintain common semantic information for contrastive learning. Alongside the contrastive objective, we propose contextual shape prediction to bring more task-relevant information for unsupervised 3D point cloud representation learning and we also provide a theoretical analysis for this pre-training goal. As compared to previous methods, representation learned by CO3 is able to be transferred to different outdoor scene dataset collected by different type of LiDAR sensors. CO3 improves current state-of-the-art methods on Once, KITTI and NuScenes datasets by up to 2.58 mAP in 3D object detection task and 3.54 mIoU in LiDAR semantic segmentation.},

Personalized federated learning ({pFL}) has emerged as a potential solution to this challenge, but existing {pFL} methods typically enhance the performance of local models at the expense of the global model's accuracy. We propose {FedHKD} (Federated Hyper-Knowledge Distillation), a novel {FL} algorithm where clients rely on knowledge distillation ({KD}) to train local models. Each client extracts and sends to the server the means of local data representations and the corresponding soft predictions---information that we refer to as ``hyper-knowledge''. The server aggregates this information and broadcasts it to the clients in support of local training. Unlike other {KD}-based {pFL} methods, {FedHKD} does not rely on a public dataset nor does it deploy a generative model at the server. We analyze the convergence of {FedHKD} and conduct extensive experiments on visual datasets in a variety of scenarios. We demonstrate that {FedHKD} provides significant improvement in both personalized as well as global model performance compared to state-of-the-art {FL} methods designed for heterogeneous data settings.},

We validate our approach on an extensive range of {PDEs} with training data from voxel grids, meshes, and point clouds.

Experiments show that we can drop up to 90\% of the intermediate tensor elements in fully-connected and convolutional layers while achieving higher testing accuracy for Visual Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks on various tasks (e.g., classification, object detection, instance segmentation).},

Recent successes in differentiable physics simulators allow learning algorithms to train a policy with analytic gradients through environment dynamics, which significantly facilitates the development of {DOM} algorithms. However, existing {DOM} benchmarks are either single-object-based or non-differentiable. This leaves the questions of 1) how a task-specific algorithm performs on other tasks and 2) how a differentiable-physics-based algorithm compares with the non-differentiable ones in general. In this work, we present {DaxBench}, a differentiable {DOM} benchmark with a wide object and task coverage. {DaxBench} includes 9 challenging high-fidelity simulated tasks, covering rope, cloth, and liquid manipulation with various difficulty levels. To better understand the performance of general algorithms on different {DOM} tasks, we conduct comprehensive experiments over representative {DOM} methods, ranging from planning to imitation learning and reinforcement learning. In addition, we provide careful empirical studies of existing decision-making algorithms based on differentiable physics, and discuss their limitations, as well as potential future directions.},

With simple gray-scale augmentation, we achieve 83.2\% {KNN} top-1 accuracy on {CIFAR-10} and 57\% on {CIFAR-100}. These results significantly close the gap between simplistic ``white-box'' methods and state-of-the-art methods. The sparse manifold transform is a principled method that doesn't require data augmentation, architectural engineering, or hyperparameter tuning, yet it achieves performance close to the state-of-the-art {SSL} methods. We also provide visualizations to illustrate how an unsupervised representation transform is formed.},

To prevent training good models on the data, we could add imperceptible perturbations to it. Since such perturbations aim at hurting the entire training process, they should reflect the vulnerability of {DNN} training, rather than that of a single model. Based on this new idea, we seek perturbed examples that are always unrecognized (never correctly classified) in training. In this paper, we uncover them by model checkpoints' gradients, forming the proposed self-ensemble protection ({SEP}), which is very effective because (1) learning on examples ignored during normal training tends to yield {DNNs} ignoring normal examples; (2) checkpoints' cross-model gradients are close to orthogonal, meaning that they are as diverse as {DNNs} with different architectures. By extensive experiments with 9 baselines on 3 datasets and 5 architectures, {SEP} is verified to be a new state-of-the-art, e.g., our small $\ell_{\infty}=2/255$ perturbations reduce the accuracy of a {CIFAR-10} {ResNet18} from 94.56\% to 14.68\%, compared to 41.35\% by the best-known method.},

We propose two simple techniques, namely Self-Conditioning and Asymmetric Time Intervals, which lead to a significant improvement in sample quality. Despite its simplicity, our approach can achieve strong performance in both discrete image generation and image captioning tasks. For discrete image generation, we significantly improve previous state-of-the-art on both {CIFAR-10} (which has 3K discrete 8-bit tokens) and {ImageNet-64×64} (which has 12K discrete 8-bit tokens).

We address these limitations by proposing {SMoE-Dropout}, a new plug-and-play training framework that enables scaling transformers to better accuracy in their full capacity without collapse. The main idea is to use a randomly initialized and fixed router network to activate experts and gradually increase the activated expert number as training progresses. {SMoE-Dropout} naturally exhibits a ``self-slimmable'' property, offering smooth and consistent performance boosts with an increase in activated experts during inference or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that {SMoE-Dropout} can train large-scale {SMoE} transformers with significantly improved performance while maintaining training stability.

However, a major challenge for this task is to select the most appropriate solution from the multiple samples generated by the pre-trained language models. A natural way to evaluate the quality and correctness of a code solution is to run it against a set of test cases, but the manual creation of such test cases is often costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel method, {CodeT}, that leverages the same pre-trained language models to automatically generate test cases for the code samples, thus reducing the human effort and increasing the coverage of the test scenarios. {CodeT} then executes the code samples using the generated test cases, and performs a dual execution agreement, which considers both the consistency of the outputs against the generated test cases and the agreement of the outputs with other code samples. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four benchmarks, {HumanEval}, {MBPP}, {APPS} and {CodeContests}, using five different pre-trained language models with varying sizes and capabilities. Our results show that {CodeT} can significantly improve the performance of code solution selection over previous methods, achieving remarkable and consistent gains across different models and benchmarks. For instance, {CodeT} improves the pass@1 metric on {HumanEval} to 65.8\%, which represents an absolute improvement of 18.8\% over the code-davinci-002 model, and an absolute improvement of more than 20\% over the previous state-of-the-art results.},

This is due to their ability to provide logical and interpretable explanations when used for predictions, as well as their ability to generalize to other tasks, domains, and data. While recent methods have been proposed to learn logical rules, the majority of these methods are either restricted by their computational complexity and can not handle the large search space of large-scale {KGs}, or show poor generalization when exposed to data outside the training set. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural model for learning compositional logical rules called {NCRL}. {NCRL} detects the best compositional structure of a rule body, and breaks it into small compositions in order to infer the rule head. By recurrently merging compositions in the rule body with a recurrent attention unit, {NCRL} finally predicts a single rule head. Experimental results show that {NCRL} learns high-quality rules, as well as being generalizable. Specifically, we show that {NCRL} is scalable, efficient, and yields state-of-the-art results for knowledge graph completion on large-scale {KGs}. Moreover, we test {NCRL} for systematic generalization by learning to reason on small-scale observed graphs and evaluating on larger unseen ones.},

  abstract     = {Graph unlearning, which involves deleting graph elements such as nodes, node labels, and relationships from a trained graph neural network ({GNN}) model, is crucial for real-world applications where data elements may become irrelevant, inaccurate, or privacy-sensitive. However, existing methods for graph unlearning either deteriorate model weights shared across all nodes or fail to effectively delete edges due to their strong dependence on local graph neighborhoods. To address these limitations, we introduce {GNNDelete}, a novel model-agnostic layer-wise operator that optimizes two critical properties, namely, Deleted Edge Consistency and Neighborhood Influence, for graph unlearning. Deleted Edge Consistency ensures that the influence of deleted elements is removed from both model weights and neighboring representations, while Neighborhood Influence guarantees that the remaining model knowledge is preserved after deletion. {GNNDelete} updates representations to delete nodes and edges from the model while retaining the rest of the learned knowledge. We conduct experiments on seven real-world graphs, showing that {GNNDelete} outperforms existing approaches by up to 38.8\% ({AUC}) on edge, node, and node feature deletion tasks, and 32.2\% on distinguishing deleted edges from non-deleted ones. Additionally, {GNNDelete} is efficient, taking 12.3× less time and 9.3× less space than retraining {GNN} from scratch on {WordNet18}.},

  abstract     = {In reward-free reinforcement learning ({RL}), an agent explores the environment first without any reward information, in order to achieve certain learning goals afterwards for any given reward. In this paper we focus on reward-free {RL} under low-rank {MDP} models, in which both the representation and linear weight vectors are unknown. Although various algorithms have been proposed for reward-free low-rank {MDPs}, the corresponding sample complexity is still far from being satisfactory. We first provide the first known sample complexity lower bound that holds for any algorithm under low-rank {MDPs}. This lower bound implies it is strictly harder to find a near-optimal policy under low-rank {MDPs} than under linear {MDPs}. We then propose a novel model-based algorithm, coined {RAFFLE}, and show it can both find an ε-optimal policy and achieve an ε-accurate system identification via reward-free exploration, with a sample complexity significantly improving the previous results.},

While {RFF} has been analyzed under various notions of error guarantee, the ability to preserve the kernel distance with relative error is less understood. We show that for a significant range of kernels, including the well-known Laplacian kernels, {RFF} cannot approximate the kernel distance with small relative error using low dimensions. We complement this by showing as long as the shift-invariant kernel is analytic, {RFF} with poly(ε^{-1} log n) dimensions achieves ε-relative error for pairwise kernel distance of n points, and the dimension bound is improved to poly(ε^{-1}log k) for the specific application of kernel k-means.},

Given the facial information of each speaker, the goal of this task is to separate the corresponding speech from the mixed speech. The existing works are designed for speech separation in a controlled setting with a fixed number of speakers (mostly 2 or 3 speakers), which seems to be impractical for real applications. As a result, we try to utilize a single model to separate the voices with a variable number of speakers. We identify two key issues in multi-speaker separation: (1) There are some noisy voice pieces belonging to other speakers in the separation results; (2) Part of the target speech is missing after separation. Accordingly, we propose {BFRNet}, including a Basic audio-visual speech separator and a Filter-Recovery Network ({FRNet}). {FRNet} can refine the coarse audio separated by basic audio-visual speech separator to address both issues mentioned above.},

  abstract     = {Causal discovery from time-series data has been a central task in machine learning. Recently, {Granger} causality inference is gaining momentum due to its good explainability and high compatibility with emerging deep neural networks. However, most existing methods assume structured input data and degenerate greatly when encountering data with randomly missing entries or non-uniform sampling frequencies, which hampers their applications in real scenarios. To address this issue, here we present {CUTS}, a neural {Granger} causal discovery algorithm to jointly impute unobserved data points and build causal graphs, via plugging in two mutually boosting modules in an iterative framework: (i) Latent data prediction stage: designs a Delayed Supervision Graph Neural Network ({DSGNN}) to hallucinate and register unstructured data which might be of high dimension and with complex distribution; (ii) Causal graph fitting stage: builds a causal adjacency matrix with imputed data under sparse penalty. Experiments show that {CUTS} effectively infers causal graphs from unstructured time-series data, with significantly superior performance to existing methods, a promising step towards applying causal discovery to real applications with non-ideal observations.},

We also study robust algorithms in the standard centralized setting, where an adversary queries an algorithm in an adaptive manner, but the number of interactions between the adversary and the algorithm is bounded. We first recall a unified framework of previous work for answering Q adaptive queries that incurs Õ(√Q) overhead in space, which is roughly a quadratic improvement over the naïve implementation, and only incurs a logarithmic overhead in query time. Our main contribution is showing that this framework can be made robust to adaptive inputs from bounded adversaries in various settings, while maintaining similar space and time complexities.},

However, its effects on 3D human body pose and shape estimation (3DHPSE) are open to question, whose target is fixed to a unique class, the human, and has an inherent task gap with SSL. We empirically study and analyze the effects of SSL and further compare it with other pre-training alternatives for 3DHPSE. The alternatives are 2D annotation-based pre-training and synthetic data pre-training, which share the motivation of SSL that aims to reduce the labeling cost. They have been widely utilized as a source of weak-supervision or fine-tuning, but have not been remarked as a pre-training source. SSL methods underperform the conventional ImageNet classification pre-training on multiple 3DHPSE benchmarks by 7.7\% on average. In contrast, despite a much less amount of pre-training data, the 2D annotation-based pre-training improves accuracy on all benchmarks and shows faster convergence during fine-tuning. Our observations challenge the naive application of the current SSL pre-training to 3DHPSE and relight the value of other data types in the pre-training aspect.},

In light of these observations, we construct the Cycle to Clique graph neural network, a novel yet simple algorithm which topologically enriches the input data of conventional graph neural networks while preserving their architectural components. This method theoretically outperforms conventional graph neural networks in classifying isomorphism classes of graphs while ensuring comparable time complexity in representing random graphs. Empirical results further support that the novel algorithm produces comparable or enhanced results in classifying benchmark graph data sets compared to contemporary variants of graph neural networks.},

To this end, we propose a unified framework of synthesizing and manipulating voice signals from analysis features, dubbed NANSY++. The backbone network of NANSY++ is trained in a self-supervised manner that does not require any annotations paired with audio. After training the backbone network, we efficiently tackle four voice applications - i.e. voice conversion, text-to-speech, singing voice synthesis, and voice designing - by partially modeling the analysis features required for each task. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework offers competitive advantages such as controllability, data efficiency, and fast training convergence, while providing high quality synthesis.

Recently, neural decoders have demonstrated their advantage over classical decoding techniques. However, recent state-of-the-art neural decoders suffer from high complexity and lack the important iterative scheme characteristic of many legacy decoders. In this work, we propose to employ denoising diffusion models for the soft decoding of linear codes at arbitrary block lengths. Our framework models the forward channel corruption as a series of diffusion steps that can be reversed iteratively. Three contributions are made: (i) a diffusion process suitable for the decoding setting is introduced (ii) the neural diffusion decoder is conditioned on the number of parity errors, which indicates the level of corruption at a given step (iii) a line search procedure based on the code's syndrome obtains the optimal reverse diffusion step size. The proposed approach demonstrates the power of diffusion models for ECC and is able to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming the other neural decoders by sizable margins, even for a single reverse diffusion step.},

We use reinforcement learning (RL) to develop a dialogue agent that avoids being short-sighted (outputting generic utterances) and maximizes overall user satisfaction. Most existing RL approaches to DM train the agent at the word-level, and thus, have to deal with a combinatorially complex action space even for a medium-size vocabulary. As a result, they struggle to produce a successful and engaging dialogue even if they are warm-started with a pre-trained LM. To address this issue, we develop a RL-based DM using a novel mixture of expert language model (MoE-LM) that consists of: (i) a LM capable of learning diverse semantics for conversation histories (ii) a number of specialized LMs (or experts) capable of generating utterances corresponding to a particular attribute or personality (iii) a RL-based DM that performs dialogue planning with the utterances generated by the experts. Our MoE approach provides greater flexibility to generate sensible utterances with different intents and allows RL to focus on conversational-level DM. We compare it with SOTA baselines on open-domain dialogues and demonstrate its effectiveness both in terms of the diversity and sensibility of the generated utterances and the overall DM performance.},

  abstract     = {We consider the standard K-armed bandit problem under a distributed trust model of differential privacy (DP), which enables to guarantee privacy without a trustworthy server. Under this trust model, previous work largely focus on achieving privacy using a shuffle protocol, where a batch of users data are randomly permuted before sending to a central server. This protocol achieves (ε,δ) or approximate-DP guarantee by sacrificing an additive O(K log T √log(1/δ)/ε) factor in T-step cumulative regret. In contrast, the optimal privacy cost to achieve a stronger (ε,0) or pure-DP guarantee under the widely used central trust model is only Θ(K log T/ε), where, however, a trusted server is required. In this work, we aim to obtain a pure-DP guarantee under distributed trust model while sacrificing no more regret than that under central trust model. We achieve this by designing a generic bandit algorithm based on successive arm elimination, where privacy is guaranteed by corrupting rewards with an equivalent discrete Laplace noise ensured by a secure computation protocol. We also show that our algorithm, when instantiated with Skellam noise and the secure protocol, ensures Rényi differential privacy -- a stronger notion than approximate DP -- under distributed trust model with a privacy cost of O(K √log T/ε). Finally, as a by-product of our techniques, we also recover the best-known regret bounds for bandits under central and local models while using only discrete privacy noise, which can avoid the privacy leakage due to floating point arithmetic of continuous noise on finite computers.},

  abstract     = {Task-free continual learning is the machine-learning setting where a model is trained online with data generated by a nonstationary stream. Conventional wisdom suggests that, in this setting, models are trained using an approach called experience replay, where the risk is computed both with respect to current stream observations and to a small subset of past observations. In this work, we explain both theoretically and empirically how experience replay biases the outputs of the model towards recent stream observations. Moreover, we propose a simple approach to mitigate this bias online, by changing how the output layer of the model is optimized. We show that our approach improves significantly the learning performance of experience-replay approaches over different datasets. Our findings suggest that, when performing experience replay, the output layer of the model should be optimized separately from the preceding layers.},

  abstract     = {As federated learning (FL) matures, privacy attacks against FL systems in turn become more numerous and complex. Attacks on language models have progressed from recovering single sentences in simple classification tasks to recovering larger parts of user data. Current attacks against federated language models are sequence-agnostic and aim to extract as much data as possible from an FL update - often at the expense of fidelity for any particular sequence. Because of this, current attacks fail to extract any meaningful data under large-scale aggregation. In realistic settings, an attacker cares most about a small portion of user data that contains sensitive personal information, for example sequences containing the phrase 'my credit card number is ...'. In this work, we propose the first attack on FL that achieves targeted extraction of sequences that contain privacy-critical phrases, whereby we employ maliciously modified parameters to allow the transformer itself to filter relevant sequences from aggregated user data and encode them in the gradient update. Our attack can effectively extract sequences of interest even against extremely large-scale aggregation.},

Unlike previous fixed or learnable positional encodings that are predefined and independent of input tokens, CPE is dynamically generated and conditioned on the local neighborhood of the input tokens. As a result, CPE can easily generalize to the input sequences that are longer than what the model has ever seen during the training. Besides, CPE can keep the desired translation equivalence in vision tasks, resulting in improved performance. We implement CPE with a simple Position Encoding Generator (PEG) to get seamlessly incorporated into the current Transformer framework. Built on PEG, we present Conditional Position encoding Vision Transformer (CPVT). We demonstrate that CPVT has visually similar attention maps compared to those with learned positional encodings and delivers outperforming results.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in explainable machine learning provide effective and faithful solutions for interpreting model behaviors. However, many explanation methods encounter efficiency issues, which largely limit their deployments in practical scenarios. Real-time explainer (RTX) frameworks have thus been proposed to accelerate the model explanation process by learning an one-feed-forward explainer. Existing RTX frameworks typically build the explainer under the supervised learning paradigm, which requires large amounts of explanation labels as the ground truth. Considering that accurate explanation labels are usually hard to obtain, due to constrained computational resources and limited human efforts, effective explainer training is still challenging in practice. In this work, we propose a COntrastive Real-Time eXplanation (CoRTX) framework to learn the explanation-oriented representation and relieve the intensive dependence of explainer training on explanation labels. Specifically, we design a synthetic strategy to select positive and negative instances for explanation representation learning. Theoretical analysis show that our selection strategy can benefit the contrastive learning process on explanation tasks. Experimental results on three real-world datasets further demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our proposed CoRTX framework.},

We perform an extensive series of ablations testing a range of sampling strategies on a suite of multilingual benchmarks, while varying model scale. We find that {UniMax} outperforms standard temperature-based sampling, and the benefits persist as scale increases.

However, most works focus on solving simple linear inverse problems in noiseless settings, which significantly under-represents the complexity of real-world problems. In this work, we extend diffusion solvers to efficiently handle general noisy (non)linear inverse problems via the {Laplace} approximation of the posterior sampling. Interestingly, the resulting posterior sampling scheme is a blended version of diffusion sampling with the manifold constrained gradient without a strict measurement consistency projection step, yielding a more desirable generative path in noisy settings compared to the previous studies. Our method demonstrates that diffusion models can incorporate various measurement noise statistics such as {Gaussian} and {Poisson}, and also efficiently handle noisy nonlinear inverse problems such as {Fourier} phase retrieval and non-uniform deblurring.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that, surprisingly, the opposite may be true -- Even though adversarial training helps when enough data is available, it may hurt robust generalization in the small sample size regime. We first prove this phenomenon for a high-dimensional linear classification setting with noiseless observations. Our proof provides explanatory insights that may also transfer to feature learning models. Using intuitive insights from the proof, we could surprisingly find perturbations on standard image datasets for which this behavior persists. Specifically, it occurs for perceptible attacks that effectively reduce class information such as object occlusions or corruptions. We observe in experiments on standard image datasets that the same behavior occurs for perceptible attacks that effectively reduce class information such as mask attacks and object corruptions.},

In the case of {Recurrent} {Neural} {Networks} ({RNNs}), there exists an additional layer of overparameterization, in the sense that a model may exhibit many solutions that generalize well for sequence lengths seen in training, some of which extrapolate to longer sequences, while others do not. Numerous works have studied the tendency of {Gradient} {Descent} ({GD}) to fit overparameterized {NNs} with solutions that generalize well. On the other hand, its tendency to fit overparameterized {RNNs} with solutions that extrapolate has been discovered only recently and is far less understood. In this paper, we analyze the extrapolation properties of {GD} when applied to overparameterized linear {RNNs}. In contrast to recent arguments suggesting an implicit bias towards short-term memory, we provide theoretical evidence for learning low-dimensional state spaces, which can also model long-term memory. Our result relies on a dynamical characterization which shows that {GD} (with small step size and near-zero initialization) strives to maintain a certain form of balancedness, as well as on tools developed in the context of the moment problem from statistics (recovery of a probability distribution from its moments). Experiments corroborate our theory, demonstrating extrapolation via learning low-dimensional state spaces with both linear and non-linear {RNNs}.},

Breaking from previous research, we present a new anomaly detection method that allows operators to exclude an attribute from being considered as relevant for anomaly detection. Our approach then learns representations which do not contain information over the nuisance attributes. Anomaly scoring is performed using a density-based approach. Importantly, our approach does not require specifying the attributes that are relevant for detecting anomalies, which is typically impossible in anomaly detection, but only attributes to ignore. An empirical investigation is presented verifying the effectiveness of our approach.},

However, compared to standard classifiers, they introduce extra parameters that scale linearly with the number of classes. This makes them infeasible to apply to larger-scale problems. In addition heteroscedastic classifiers introduce a critical temperature hyperparameter which must be tuned. We propose {HET-XL}, a heteroscedastic classifier whose parameter count when compared to a standard classifier scales independently of the number of classes. In our large-scale settings, we show that we can remove the need to tune the temperature hyperparameter, by directly learning it on the training data. On large image classification datasets with up to 4B images and 30k classes our method requires 14X fewer additional parameters, does not require tuning the temperature on a held-out set and performs consistently better than the baseline heteroscedastic classifier. {HET-XL} improves {ImageNet} 0-shot classification in a multimodal contrastive learning setup which can be viewed as a 3.5 billion class classification problem.},

We propose a new primal--dual algorithm, in which the dual update is randomized; equivalently, the proximity operator of one of the function in the problem is replaced by a stochastic oracle. For instance, some randomly chosen dual variables, instead of all, are updated at each iteration. Or, the proximity operator of a function is called with some small probability only. A nonsmooth variance-reduction technique is implemented so that the algorithm finds an exact minimizer of the general problem involving smooth and nonsmooth functions, possibly composed with linear operators. But our randomization technique is general and encompasses many unbiased mechanisms beyond sampling and probabilistic updates, including compression. Since the convergence speed depends on the slowest among the primal and dual contraction mechanisms, the iteration complexity might remain the same when randomness is used. On the other hand, the computation complexity can be significantly reduced. Overall, randomness helps getting faster algorithms. This has long been known for stochastic-gradient-type algorithms, and our work shows that this fully applies in the more general primal--dual setting as well.},

  abstract     = {Human languages enable robust generalization, letting us leverage our prior experience to communicate about novel meanings. This is partly due to language being compositional, where the meaning of a whole expression is a function of its parts. Natural languages also exhibit extensive variation, encoding meaning predictably enough to enable generalization without limiting speakers to one and only one way of expressing something. Previous work looking at the languages that emerge between neural networks in a communicative task has shown languages that enable robust communication and generalization reliably emerge. Despite this those languages score poorly on existing measures of compositionality leading to claims that a language's degree of compositionality has little bearing on how well it can generalise. We argue that the languages that emerge between networks are in fact straightforwardly compositional, but with a degree of natural language-like variation that can obscure their compositionality from existing measures. We introduce 4 measures of linguistic variation and show that early in training measures of variation correlate with generalization performance, but that this effect goes away over time as the languages that emerge become regular enough to generalize robustly. Like natural languages, emergent languages appear able to support a high degree of variation while retaining the generalizability we expect from compositionality. In an effort to decrease the variability of emergent languages we show how reducing a model's capacity results in greater regularity, in line with claims about factors shaping the emergence of regularity in human language.},

However, all the existing methods usually either impose the constraints in a 'weak' form at training time, with no guarantees at inference, or fail to provide a general framework that supports different tasks and constraint types. We tackle this open problem from a neuro-symbolic perspective. Our pipeline enhances a conventional neural predictor with (1) a symbolic reasoning module capable of correcting structured prediction errors and (2) a neural attention module that learns to direct the reasoning effort to focus on potential prediction errors, while keeping other outputs unchanged. This framework provides an appealing trade-off between the efficiency of constraint-free neural inference and the prohibitive cost of exhaustive reasoning at inference time. We show that our method outperforms the state of the art on visual-Sudoku, and can also benefit visual scene graph prediction. Furthermore, it can improve the performance of existing neuro-symbolic systems that lack our explicit reasoning during inference.},

To do so, we map this manifold to the product space of the degrees of freedom (translational, rotational, and torsional) involved in docking and develop an efficient diffusion process on this space. Empirically, DiffDock obtains a 38% top-1 success rate (RMSD<2A) on PDBBind, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art of traditional docking (23%) and deep learning (20%) methods. Moreover, while previous methods are not able to dock on computationally folded structures (maximum accuracy 10.4%), DiffDock maintains significantly higher precision (21.7%).

Semantic image editing is an extension of image generation, with the additional constraint that the generated image should be as similar as possible to a given input image. Current editing methods based on diffusion models usually require to provide a mask, making the task much easier by treating it as a conditional inpainting task. In contrast, our main contribution is able to automatically generate a mask highlighting regions of the input image that need to be edited, by contrasting predictions of a diffusion model conditioned on different text prompts. Moreover, we rely on latent inference to preserve content in those regions of interest and show excellent synergies with mask-based diffusion. DiffEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance on ImageNet. In addition, we evaluate semantic image editing in more challenging settings, using images from the COCO dataset as well as text-based generated images.},

While the utility of curvature has been theoretically and empirically confirmed in the context of manifolds and graphs, its generalization to the emerging domain of hypergraphs has remained largely unexplored. On graphs, the Ollivier-Ricci curvature measures differences between random walks via Wasserstein distances, thus grounding a geometric concept in ideas from probability theory and optimal transport. The authors develop Orchid, a flexible framework generalizing Ollivier-Ricci curvature to hypergraphs, and prove that the resulting curvatures have favorable theoretical properties. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world hypergraphs from different domains, they demonstrate that Orchid curvatures are both scalable and useful to perform a variety of hypergraph tasks in practice.},

Current explanation approaches rely on attention values or input gradients, but these provide a limited view of a model's dependencies. Shapley values offer a theoretically sound alternative, but their computational cost makes them impractical for large, high-dimensional models. In this work, we aim to make Shapley values practical for vision transformers (ViTs). To do so, we first leverage an attention masking approach to evaluate ViTs with partial information, and we then develop a procedure to generate Shapley value explanations via a separate, learned explainer model. Our experiments compare Shapley values to many baseline methods (e.g., attention rollout, GradCAM, LRP), and we find that our approach provides more accurate explanations than existing methods for ViTs.},

  abstract     = {Gradient clipping is an important technique for deep neural networks with exploding gradients, such as recurrent neural networks. Recent studies have shown that the loss functions of these networks do not satisfy the conventional smoothness condition, but instead satisfy a relaxed smoothness condition, i.e., the Lipschitz constant of the gradient scales linearly in terms of the gradient norm. Due to this observation, several gradient clipping algorithms have been developed for nonconvex and relaxed-smooth functions. However, the existing algorithms only apply to the single-machine or multiple-machine setting with homogeneous data across machines. It remains unclear how to design provably efficient gradient clipping algorithms in the general Federated Learning (FL) setting with heterogeneous data and limited communication rounds. In this paper, they design EPISODE, the very first algorithm to solve FL problems with heterogeneous data in the nonconvex and relaxed smoothness setting. The key ingredients of the algorithm are two new techniques called "episodic gradient clipping" and "periodic resampled corrections". At the beginning of each round, EPISODE resamples stochastic gradients from each client and obtains the global averaged gradient, which is used to (1) determine whether to apply gradient clipping for the entire round and (2) construct local gradient corrections for each client. Their algorithm and analysis provide a unified framework for both homogeneous and heterogeneous data under any noise level of the stochastic gradient, and it achieves state-of-the-art complexity results. In particular, they prove that EPISODE can achieve linear speedup in the number of machines, and it requires significantly fewer communication rounds.},

We show that language models tend to perform fairly well at single step inference or entailment tasks, but struggle to chain together multiple reasoning steps to solve more complex problems. In light of this, we propose a Selection-Inference (SI) framework that exploits pre-trained LLMs as general processing modules, and alternates between selection and inference to generate a series of interpretable, casual reasoning steps leading to the final answer. We show that a 7B parameter LLM used within the SI framework in a 5-shot generalisation setting, with no fine-tuning, yields a performance improvement of over 100% compared to an equivalent vanilla baseline on a suite of 10 logical reasoning tasks.},

Unfortunately, existing methods fail to produce teams of agents that are simultaneously diverse, high performing, and reasonable. In this work, we propose a novel approach, adversarial diversity (ADVERSITY), which is designed for turn-based Dec-POMDPs with public actions. ADVERSITY relies on off-belief learning to encourage reasonableness and skill, and on 'repulsive' fictitious transitions to encourage diversity. We use this approach to generate new agents with distinct but reasonable play styles for the card game Hanabi and open-source our agents to be used for future research on (ad-hoc) coordination.},

We push the limits of the sample efficiency of carefully-modified algorithms by training them using an order of magnitude more updates than usual, significantly improving their performance in the Atari 100k and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks.

Many applications of contextual bandits involve multiple agents who collaborate without sharing raw observations, thus giving rise to the setting of federated contextual bandits. Existing works on federated contextual bandits rely on linear or kernelized bandits, which may fall short when modeling complex real-world reward functions. So, this paper introduces the federated neural-upper confidence bound (FN-UCB) algorithm. FN-UCB adopts a weighted combination of two UCBs: UCB^a allows every agent to additionally use the observations from the other agents to accelerate exploration (without sharing raw observations), while UCB^b uses an NN with aggregated parameters for reward prediction in a similar way to federated averaging.},

In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable nearest neighbor machine translation framework to drastically promote the decoding and storage efficiency of kNN-based models while maintaining the translation performance. To this end, we dynamically construct an extremely small datastore for each input via sentence-level retrieval to avoid searching the entire datastore in vanilla kNN-MT, based on which we further introduce a distance-aware adapter to adaptively incorporate the kNN retrieval results into the pre-trained NMT models.},

However, this overlooks the fact that there are many diverse and unique retrieval tasks, each targeting different search intents, queries, and search domains. In this paper, we suggest to work on Few-shot Dense Retrieval, a setting where each task comes with a short description and a few examples. To amplify the power of a few examples, we propose Prompt-base Query Generation for Retriever (Promptagator), which leverages large language models (LLM) as a few-shot query generator, and creates task-specific retrievers based on the generated data. Powered by LLM's generalization ability, Promptagator makes it possible to create task-specific end-to-end retrievers solely based on a few examples without using Natural Questions or MS MARCO to train question generators or dual encoders.},

  abstract     = {Traditional analyses of gradient descent show that when the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian, also known as the sharpness $S(\theta)$, is bounded by $2/\eta$, training is ``stable'' and the training loss decreases monotonically. Recent works, however, have observed that this assumption does not hold when training modern neural networks with full batch or large batch gradient descent. Most recently, Cohen et al. (2021) observed two important phenomena. The first, dubbed progressive sharpening, is that the sharpness steadily increases throughout training until it reaches the instability cutoff $2/\eta$. The second, dubbed edge of stability, is that the sharpness hovers at $2/\eta$ for the remainder of training while the loss continues decreasing, albeit non-monotonically. We demonstrate that, far from being chaotic, the dynamics of gradient descent at the edge of stability can be captured by a cubic Taylor expansion: as the iterates diverge in direction of the top eigenvector of the Hessian due to instability, the cubic term in the local Taylor expansion of the loss function causes the curvature to decrease until stability is restored. This property, which we call self-stabilization, is a general property of gradient descent and explains its behavior at the edge of stability. A key consequence of self-stabilization is that gradient descent at the edge of stability implicitly follows projected gradient descent (PGD) under the constraint $S(\theta) \le 2/\eta$. Our analysis provides precise predictions for the loss, sharpness, and deviation from the PGD trajectory throughout training, which we verify both empirically in a number of standard settings and theoretically under mild conditions. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism for gradient descent's implicit bias towards stability.},

Motivated from entirely different viewpoints, their loss functions appear to be unrelated. In practice, they yield strongly differing embeddings and can suggest conflicting interpretations of the same data. The fundamental reasons for this and, more generally, the exact relationship between $t$-SNE and UMAP have remained unclear. In this work, we uncover their conceptual connection via a new insight into contrastive learning methods. Noise-contrastive estimation can be used to optimize $t$-SNE, while UMAP relies on negative sampling, another contrastive method. We find the precise relationship between these two contrastive methods, and provide a mathematical characterization of the distortion introduced by negative sampling. Visually, this distortion results in UMAP generating more compact embeddings with tighter clusters compared to $t$-SNE. We exploit this new conceptual connection to propose and implement a generalization of negative sampling, allowing us to interpolate between (and even extrapolate beyond) $t$-SNE and UMAP and their respective embeddings. Moving along this spectrum of embeddings leads to a trade-off between discrete / local and continuous / global structures, mitigating the risk of over-interpreting ostensible features of any single embedding. We provide a PyTorch implementation.},

Many current models suffer from extreme sensitivity to adversarial attacks and often do not align well with the image-by-image behavioral error patterns observed in humans. Previous research has provided strong evidence that primate object recognition behavior can be very accurately predicted by neural population activity in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex, a brain area in the late stages of the visual processing hierarchy. Therefore, here we directly test whether making the late stage representations of models more similar to that of macaque IT produces new models that exhibit more robust, primate-like behavior. We conducted chronic, large-scale multi-electrode recordings across the IT cortex in six non-human primates (rhesus macaques). We then use these data to fine-tune (end-to-end) the model ``IT'' representations such that they are more aligned with the biological IT representations, while preserving accuracy on object recognition tasks. We generate a cohort of models with a range of IT similarity scores validated on held-out animals across two image sets with distinct statistics. Across a battery of optimization conditions, we observed a strong correlation between the models' IT-likeness and alignment with human behavior, as well as an increase in its adversarial robustness.},

In this work, we present new identifiability results for multimodal contrastive learning, showing that it is possible to recover shared factors in a more general setup than the multi-view setting studied previously. Specifically, we distinguish between the multi-view setting with one generative mechanism (e.g., multiple cameras of the same type) and the multimodal setting that is characterized by distinct mechanisms (e.g., cameras and microphones). Our work generalizes previous identifiability results by redefining the generative process in terms of distinct mechanisms with modality-specific latent variables. We prove that contrastive learning can block-identify latent factors shared between modalities, even when there are nontrivial dependencies between factors. We empirically verify our identifiability results with numerical simulations and corroborate our findings on a complex multimodal dataset of image/text pairs. Zooming out, our work provides a theoretical basis for multimodal representation learning and explains in which settings multimodal contrastive learning can be effective in practice.},

  abstract     = {Comparing learned neural representations in neural networks is a challenging but important problem, which has been approached in different ways. The Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity metric, particularly its linear variant, has recently become a popular approach and has been widely used to compare representations of a network's different layers, of architecturally similar networks trained differently, or of models with different architectures trained on the same data. A wide variety of conclusions about similarity and dissimilarity of these various representations have been made using CKA. In this work we present analysis that formally characterizes CKA sensitivity to a large class of simple transformations, which can naturally occur in the context of modern machine learning. This provides a concrete explanation of CKA sensitivity to outliers, which has been observed in past works, and to transformations that preserve the linear separability of the data, an important generalization attribute. We empirically investigate several weaknesses of the CKA similarity metric, demonstrating situations in which it gives unexpected or counter-intuitive results. Finally we study approaches for modifying representations to maintain functional behaviour while changing the CKA value. Our results illustrate that, in many cases, the CKA value can be easily manipulated without substantial changes to the functional behaviour of the models, and call for caution when leveraging activation alignment metrics.},

However, understanding when and how neural networks generalize remains one of the most important unsolved problems in the field. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study (20'910 models, 15 tasks) to investigate whether insights from the theory of computation can predict the limits of neural network generalization in practice. We demonstrate that grouping tasks according to the Chomsky hierarchy allows us to forecast whether certain architectures will be able to generalize to out-of-distribution inputs. This includes negative results where even extensive amounts of data and training time never lead to any non-trivial generalization, despite models having sufficient capacity to fit the training data perfectly. Our results show that, for our subset of tasks, RNNs and Transformers fail to generalize on non-regular tasks, LSTMs can solve regular and counter-language tasks, and only networks augmented with structured memory (such as a stack or memory tape) can successfully generalize on context-free and context-sensitive tasks.},

  abstract     = {Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has many success stories, the large-scale deployment of policies learned through these advanced techniques in safety-critical scenarios is hindered by their lack of formal guarantees. Variational Markov Decision Processes (VAE-MDPs) are discrete latent space models that provide a reliable framework for distilling formally verifiable controllers from any RL policy. While the related guarantees address relevant practical aspects such as the satisfaction of performance and safety properties, the VAE approach suffers from several learning flaws (posterior collapse, slow learning speed, poor dynamics estimates), primarily due to the absence of abstraction and representation guarantees to support latent optimization. We introduce the Wasserstein auto-encoded MDP (WAE-MDP), a latent space model that fixes those issues by minimizing a penalized form of the optimal transport between the behaviors of the agent executing the original policy and the distilled policy, for which the formal guarantees apply. Our approach yields bisimulation guarantees while learning the distilled policy, allowing concrete optimization of the abstraction and representation model quality. Our experiments show that, besides distilling policies up to 10 times faster, the latent model quality is indeed better in general. Moreover, we present experiments from a simple time-to-failure verification algorithm on the latent space. The fact that our approach enables such simple verification techniques highlights its applicability.},

  abstract     = {Algorithmic fairness plays an important role in machine learning and imposing fairness constraints during learning is a common approach. However, many datasets are imbalanced in certain label classes (e.g. 'healthy') and sensitive subgroups (e.g. 'older patients'). Empirically, this imbalance leads to a lack of generalizability not only of classification, but also of fairness properties, especially in over-parameterized models. For example, fairness-aware training may ensure equalized odds (EO) on the training data, but EO is far from being satisfied on new users. In this paper, we propose a theoretically-principled, yet Flexible approach that is Imbalance-Fairness-Aware (FIFA). Specifically, FIFA encourages both classification and fairness generalization and can be flexibly combined with many existing fair learning methods with logits-based losses. While our main focus is on EO, FIFA can be directly applied to achieve equalized opportunity (EqOpt); and under certain conditions, it can also be applied to other fairness notions. We demonstrate the power of FIFA by combining it with a popular fair classification algorithm, and the resulting algorithm achieves significantly better fairness generalization on several real-world datasets.},

We view the diffusion denoising process as a sequential decision making process, and show that it exhibits compounding errors similar to exposure bias issues in imitation learning problems. To mitigate these issues, we adapt the scheduled sampling algorithm to diffusion training. We conduct experiments on four markup datasets: mathematical formulas (LaTeX), table layouts (HTML), sheet music (LilyPond), and molecular images (SMILES). These experiments each verify the effectiveness of the diffusion process and the use of scheduled sampling to fix generation issues. These results also show that the markup-to-image task presents a useful controlled compositional setting for diagnosing and analyzing generative image models.},

Our differentiable vortex particles are coupled with a learnable, vortex-to-velocity dynamics mapping to effectively capture the complex flow features in a physically-constrained, low-dimensional space. This representation facilitates the learning of a fluid simulator tailored to the input video that can deliver robust, long-term future predictions. The value of our method is twofold: first, our learned simulator enables the inference of hidden physics quantities (e.g., velocity field) purely from visual observation; secondly, it also supports future prediction, constructing the input video's sequel along with its future dynamics evolution. We compare our method with a range of existing methods on both synthetic and real-world videos, demonstrating improved reconstruction quality, visual plausibility, and physical integrity.},

Whilst much work has been done to formulate useful auxiliary objectives, their construction is still an art which proceeds by slow and tedious hand-design. Intuition for how and when these objectives improve end-task performance has also had limited theoretical backing. In this work, we present an approach for automatically generating a suite of auxiliary objectives. We achieve this by deconstructing existing objectives within a novel unified taxonomy, identifying connections between them, and generating new ones based on the uncovered structure. Next, we theoretically formalize widely-held intuitions about how auxiliary learning improves generalization on the end-task. This leads us to a principled and efficient algorithm for searching the space of generated objectives to find those most useful to a specified end-task. With natural language processing (NLP) as our domain of study, we demonstrate that our automated auxiliary learning pipeline leads to strong improvements over competitive baselines across continued training experiments on a pre-trained model on 5 NLP end-tasks.},

To do so, we encode trajectories in offline training data individually as well as collectively (encoding a set of trajectories). We then attribute policy decisions to a set of trajectories in this encoded space by estimating the sensitivity of the decision with respect to that set. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of quality of attributions as well as practical scalability in diverse environments that involve both discrete and continuous state and action spaces such as grid-worlds, video games (Atari) and continuous control (MuJoCo). We also conduct a human study on a simple navigation task to observe how their understanding of the task compares with data attributed for a trained RL policy.},

We prove that spatial gradient scaling achieves the same learning dynamics as a branched reparameterization yet without introducing structural changes into the network. We further propose an analytical approach that dynamically learns scalings for each convolutional layer based on the spatial characteristics of its input feature map gauged by mutual information. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet show that without searching for reparameterized structures, our proposed scaling method outperforms the state-of-the-art reparameterization methods at a lower computational cost.},

  abstract     = {Recent self-supervised visual representation methods are closing the gap with supervised learning performance. Most of these successful methods rely on maximizing the similarity between embeddings of related synthetic inputs created through data augmentations. This can be seen as a task that encourages embeddings to leave out factors modified by these augmentations, i.e. to be invariant to them. However, this only considers one side of the trade-off in the choice of the augmentations: they need to strongly modify the images to avoid simple solution shortcut learning (e.g. using only color histograms), but on the other hand, augmentations-related information may be lacking in the representations for some downstream tasks (e.g. literature shows that color is important for bird and flower classification). Few recent works proposed to mitigate this problem of using only an invariance task by exploring some form of equivariance to augmentations. This has been performed by learning additional embeddings space(s), where some augmentation(s) cause embeddings to differ, yet in a non-controlled way. In this work, we introduce EquiMod a generic equivariance module that structures the learned latent space, in the sense that our module learns to predict the displacement in the embedding space caused by the augmentations. We show that applying that module to state-of-the-art invariance models, such as BYOL and SimCLR, increases the performances on the usual CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets. Moreover, while our model could collapse to a trivial equivariance, i.e. invariance, we observe that it instead automatically learns to keep some augmentations-related information beneficial to the representations.},

To address this shortcoming, we generalize transformer attention to consider and update edge vectors in each transformer layer. We evaluate this relational transformer on a diverse array of graph-structured tasks, including the large and challenging CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark. There, it dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks expressly designed to reason over graph-structured data. Our analysis demonstrates that these gains are attributable to relational attention's inherent ability to leverage the greater expressivity of graphs over sets.},

Among existing FL solutions, one-shot FL is a promising and challenging direction, where the clients conduct FL training with a single communication round. However, while label skew is a common real-world scenario where some clients may have few or no data of some classes, existing one-shot FL approaches that conduct voting on the local models are not able to produce effective global models. Due to the limited number of classes in each party, the local models misclassify the data from unseen classes into seen classes, which leads to very ineffective global models from voting. To address the label skew issue in one-shot FL, we propose a novel approach named FedOV which generates diverse outliers and introduces them as an additional unknown class in local training to improve the voting performance. Specifically, based on open-set recognition, we propose novel outlier generation approaches by corrupting the original features and further develop adversarial learning to enhance the outliers. Our extensive experiments show that FedOV can significantly improve the test accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches in various label skew settings.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, deep network pruning has attracted significant attention in order to enable the rapid deployment of AI into small devices with computation and memory constraints. Pruning is often achieved by dropping redundant weights, neurons, or layers of a deep network while attempting to retain a comparable test performance. Many deep pruning algorithms have been proposed with impressive empirical success. However, existing approaches lack a quantifiable measure to estimate the compressibility of a sub-network during each pruning iteration and thus may under-prune or over-prune the model. In this work, we propose PQ Index (PQI) to measure the potential compressibility of deep neural networks and use this to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm. Our extensive experiments corroborate the hypothesis that for a generic pruning procedure, PQI decreases first when a large model is being effectively regularized and then increases when its compressibility reaches a limit that appears to correspond to the beginning of underfitting. Subsequently, PQI decreases again when the model collapse and significant deterioration in the performance of the model start to occur. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed adaptive pruning algorithm with proper choice of hyper-parameters is superior to the iterative pruning algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both compression efficiency and robustness.},

Such a methodology is referred to as Gradient Re-parameterization, and the optimizers are named RepOptimizers. For the extreme simplicity of model structure, we focus on a VGG-style plain model and showcase that such a simple model trained with a RepOptimizer, which is referred to as RepOpt-VGG, performs on par with or better than the recent well-designed models. From a practical perspective, RepOpt-VGG is a favorable base model because of its simple structure, high inference speed and training efficiency. Compared to Structural Re-parameterization, which adds priors into models via constructing extra training-time structures, RepOptimizers require no extra forward/backward computations and solve the problem of quantization.},

While several heuristics exist that follow this strategy, methods are still missing that rely on thorough theories for bounding the target error. In this turn, we propose a method that extends weighted least squares to vector-valued functions, e.g., deep neural networks. We show that the target error of the proposed algorithm is asymptotically not worse than twice the error of the unknown optimal aggregation.

  abstract     = {The separation between training and deployment of machine learning models implies that not all scenarios encountered in deployment can be anticipated during training, and therefore relying solely on advancements in training has its limits. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important area that stress-tests a model's ability to handle unseen situations: Do models know when they don't know? Existing OOD detection methods either incur extra training steps, additional data or make nontrivial modifications to the trained network. In contrast, in this work, we propose an extremely simple, post-hoc, on-the-fly activation shaping method, ASH, where a large portion (e.g. 90%) of a sample's activation at a late layer is removed, and the rest (e.g. 10%) simplified or lightly adjusted. The shaping is applied at inference time, and does not require any statistics calculated from training data. Experiments show that such a simple treatment enhances in-distribution and out-of-distribution distinction so as to allow state-of-the-art OOD detection on ImageNet, and does not noticeably deteriorate the in-distribution accuracy.},

  abstract     = {We consider Contextual Bandits with Concave Rewards (CBCR), a multi-objective bandit problem where the desired trade-off between the rewards is defined by a known concave objective function, and the reward vector depends on an observed stochastic context. We present the first algorithm with provably vanishing regret for CBCR without restrictions on the policy space, whereas prior works were restricted to finite policy spaces or tabular representations. Our solution is based on a geometric interpretation of CBCR algorithms as optimization algorithms over the convex set of expected rewards spanned by all stochastic policies. Building on Frank-Wolfe analyses in constrained convex optimization, we derive a novel reduction from the CBCR regret to the regret of a scalar-reward bandit problem. We illustrate how to apply the reduction off-the-shelf to obtain algorithms for CBCR with both linear and general reward functions, in the case of non-combinatorial actions. Motivated by fairness in recommendation, we describe a special case of CBCR with rankings and fairness-aware objectives, leading to the first algorithm with regret guarantees for contextual combinatorial bandits with fairness of exposure.},

Towards this end, exploiting the relation between convex orders and optimal transport, we introduce the Choquet-Toland distance between probability measures, that can be used as a drop-in replacement for IPMs. We also introduce the Variational Dominance Criterion (VDC) to learn probability measures with dominance constraints, that encode the desired stochastic order between the learned measure and a known baseline. We analyze both quantities and show that they suffer from the curse of dimensionality and propose surrogates via input convex maxout networks (ICMNs), that enjoy parametric rates.},

Even two-layer neural networks cannot be guaranteed to extrapolate outside the support of the training distribution without further assumptions on the domain shift. We analyze the extrapolation of nonlinear models for structured domain shift and prove that the family of nonlinear models of the form f(x) = ∑ f_i(x_i) can extrapolate to unseen distributions, if the covariance of the features is well-conditioned. This represents the first result that goes beyond linear models and the bounded density ratio assumption for understanding extrapolation in machine learning.},

In this paper, we design the first asymptotic instance-optimal algorithm for general interactive decision making problems with finite number of decisions under mild conditions. On every instance f, our algorithm outperforms all consistent algorithms (those achieving non-trivial regrets on all instances), and has asymptotic regret C(f) ln n, where C(f) is an exact characterization of the complexity of f. The key step of the algorithm involves hypothesis testing with active data collection.},

Despite the powerful expressiveness of the popular recurrent neural network (RNN) models for point process data, they may not successfully capture sophisticated non-stationary dependencies in the data due to their recurrent structures. Another popular type of deep model for point process data is based on representing the influence kernel (rather than the intensity function) by neural networks. We take the latter approach and develop a new deep non-stationary influence kernel that can model non-stationary spatio-temporal point processes. The main idea is to approximate the influence kernel with a novel and general low-rank decomposition, enabling efficient representation through deep neural networks and computational efficiency and better performance. We take a new approach to maintain the non-negativity constraint of the conditional intensity by introducing a log-barrier penalty. We demonstrate the good performance and computational efficiency of our method compared with the state-of-the-art on simulated and real data.},

  abstract     = {The electronic design automation of analog circuits has been a longstanding challenge in the integrated circuit field due to the huge design space and complex design trade-offs among circuit specifications. In the past decades, intensive research efforts have mostly been paid to automate the transistor sizing with a given circuit topology. By recognizing the graph nature of circuits, this paper presents a Circuit Graph Neural Network (CktGNN) that simultaneously automates the circuit topology generation and device sizing based on the encoder-dependent optimization subroutines. Particularly, CktGNN encodes circuit graphs using a two-level GNN framework (of nested GNN) where circuits are represented as combinations of subgraphs in a known subgraph basis. In this way, it significantly improves design efficiency by reducing the number of subgraphs to perform message passing. Nonetheless, another critical roadblock to advancing learning-assisted circuit design automation is a lack of public benchmarks to perform canonical assessment and reproducible research. To tackle the challenge, we introduce Open Circuit Benchmark (OCB), an open-sourced dataset that contains 10K distinct operational amplifiers with carefully-extracted circuit specifications. OCB is also equipped with communicative circuit generation and evaluation capabilities such that it can help to generalize CktGNN to design various analog circuits by producing corresponding datasets. Experiments on OCB show the extraordinary advantages of CktGNN through representation-based optimization frameworks over other recent powerful GNN baselines and human experts' manual designs.},

In this paper, we propose GEASS (GrAnger fEAture Selection of Spatiotemporal data), a method that identifies sparse Granger causality mechanisms of high dimensional spatiotemporal data by a single neural network. GEASS maximizes sparsity-regularized modified transfer entropy with a theoretical guarantee of recovering features with spatial/temporal Granger causal relationships. The sparsity regularization is achieved by a novel combinatorial stochastic gate layer to select sparse non-overlapping feature subsets. We demonstrate the efficacy of GEASS in several synthetic datasets and real biological data from single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, where GEASS infers biologically meaningful causal regulatory patterns that align with existing biological knowledge.},

In this paper, we revisit masked modeling in a unified fashion of knowledge distillation, showing that foundational Transformers pretrained with 2D images or natural languages can help self-supervised 3D representation learning through training {A}utoencoders as {C}ross-{M}odal {T}eachers ({ACT}). {ACT} is generally applicable to different 3D Transformers, and we instantiate it on a strong 3D learner {P}oint-{MAE}. Taking pretrained Vision or Language Transformers as cross-modal 3D teachers, we train {ACT} to encode 3D point clouds into discrete tokens using Vector Quantized Variational {A}utoencoder and guide 3D masked autoencoding through cross-modal supervision. The pretrained Transformers are transferred as cross-modal 3D teachers using discrete variational autoencoding self-supervision, during which the Transformers are frozen with prompt tuning for better knowledge inheritance. The latent features encoded by the 3D teachers are used as the target of masked point modeling, wherein the dark knowledge is distilled to the 3D Transformer students as foundational geometry understanding. {ACT} pretrained 3D learner achieves state-of-the-art generalization capacity across various downstream benchmarks, e.g., 88.21{\%} overall accuracy on {S}can{O}bject{NN}.},

With the popularity of {Stein} variational gradient descent ({SVGD}), the focus of particle-based {VI} algorithms has been on the properties of functions in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space ({RKHS}) to approximate the gradient flow. However, the requirement of {RKHS} restricts the function class and algorithmic flexibility. This paper offers a general solution to this problem by introducing a functional regularization term that encompasses the {RKHS} norm as a special case. This allows us to propose a new particle-based {VI} algorithm called preconditioned functional gradient flow ({PFG}). Compared to {SVGD}, {PFG} has several advantages. It has a larger function class, improved scalability in large particle-size scenarios, better adaptation to ill-conditioned distributions, and provable continuous-time convergence in {KL} divergence. Additionally, non-linear function classes such as neural networks can be incorporated to estimate the gradient flow. Our theory and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

However, in reinforcement learning, even for supervised sub-problems such as world model learning, early stopping is not applicable as the dataset is continually evolving. As a solution, we propose a new general method that dynamically adjusts the update to data ({UTD}) ratio during training based on under- and overfitting detection on a small subset of the continuously collected experience not used for training. We apply our method to {DreamerV2}, a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, and evaluate it on the {DeepMind} Control Suite and the Atari 100k benchmark. The results demonstrate that one can better balance under- and overestimation by adjusting the {UTD} ratio with our approach compared to the default setting in {DreamerV2} and that it is competitive with an extensive hyperparameter search which is not feasible for many applications. Our method eliminates the need to set the {UTD} hyperparameter by hand and even leads to a higher robustness with regard to other learning-related hyperparameters further reducing the amount of necessary tuning.},

For example, {2D} space obeys rules: the same set of actions combine in the same way everywhere (step north, then south, and you won't have moved, wherever you start). We suggest the brain must represent this consistent meaning of actions across space, as it allows you to find new short-cuts and navigate in unfamiliar settings. We term this representation an 'actionable representation'. We formulate actionable representations using group and representation theory, and show that, when combined with biological and functional constraints - non-negative firing, bounded neural activity, and precise coding - multiple modules of hexagonal grid cells are the optimal representation of {2D} space. We support this claim with intuition, analytic justification, and simulations. Our analytic results normatively explain a set of surprising grid cell phenomena, and make testable predictions for future experiments. Lastly, we highlight the generality of our approach beyond just understanding {2D} space. Our work characterises a new principle for understanding and designing flexible internal representations: they should be actionable, allowing animals and machines to predict the consequences of their actions, rather than just encode.},

Based on the proposed dataset, we new energy-aware {AutoML} method that arms existing {AutoML} algorithms to consider the search energy consumption, and our experiments show that the modified energy-aware {AutoML} methods achieve a better trade-off between energy consumption and model performance.},

In this work, we introduce the exponential family variational Kalman filter ({eVKF}), an online recursive Bayesian method aimed at inferring latent trajectories while simultaneously learning the dynamical system generating them. {eVKF} works for arbitrary likelihoods and utilizes the constant base measure exponential family to model the latent state stochasticity. We derive a closed-form variational analog to the predict step of the Kalman filter which leads to a provably tighter bound on the {ELBO} compared to another online variational method. We validate our method on synthetic and real-world data, and, notably, show that it achieves competitive performance.},

Our best method is based on least-to-most prompting: it decomposes the problem using prompting-based syntactic parsing, then uses this decomposition to select appropriate exemplars and to sequentially generate the semantic parse. This method allows us to set a new state of the art for {CFQ} while requiring only 1\% of the training data used by traditional approaches.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel {Collaborative Pure Exploration in Kernel Bandit} model ({CoPE-KB}), where multiple agents collaborate to complete different but related tasks with limited communication. Our model generalizes prior {CoPE} formulation with the single-task and classic {MAB} setting to allow multiple tasks and general reward structures. We propose a novel communication scheme with an efficient kernelized estimator, and design optimal algorithms {CoKernelFC} and {CoKernelFB} for {CoPE-KB} with fixed-confidence and fixed-budget objectives, respectively. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds in both sampling and communication complexity are established to demonstrate the optimality of our algorithms. Our theoretical results explicitly quantify how task similarities influence learning speedup, and only depend on the effective dimension of feature space. Our novel techniques including an efficient kernelized estimator and linear structured instance transformation, which overcome the communication difficulty in high-dimensional feature space and derive communication round lower bounds, can be of independent interests.},

  abstract     = {Traditional recurrent neural networks ({RNN}s) have a fixed, finite number of memory cells. In theory (assuming bounded range and precision), this limits their formal language recognition power to regular languages, and in practice, {RNN}s have been shown to be unable to learn many context-free languages ({CFL}s). In order to expand the class of languages {RNN}s recognize, prior work has augmented {RNN}s with a nondeterministic stack data structure, putting them on par with pushdown automata and increasing their language recognition power to {CFL}s. Nondeterminism is needed for recognizing all {CFL}s (not just deterministic {CFL}s), but in this paper, we show that nondeterminism and the neural controller interact to produce two more unexpected abilities. First, the nondeterministic stack {RNN} can recognize not only {CFL}s, but also many non-context-free languages. Second, it can recognize languages with much larger alphabet sizes than one might expect given the size of its stack alphabet. Finally, to increase the information capacity in the stack and allow it to solve more complicated tasks with large alphabet sizes, we propose a new version of the nondeterministic stack that simulates stacks of vectors rather than discrete symbols. We demonstrate perplexity improvements with this new model on the Penn Treebank language modeling benchmark.},

This formulation is applicable to real-world tasks that demand strong risk avoidance throughout the decision process, such as autonomous driving, clinical treatment planning and robotics. We investigate two performance metrics under Iterated {CVaR} {RL}: Regret Minimization and Best Policy Identification. For both metrics, we design efficient algorithms {ICVaR-RM} and {ICVaR-BPI}, respectively, and provide nearly matching upper and lower bounds with respect to the number of episodes $K$. We also investigate an interesting limiting case of Iterated {CVaR} {RL}, called Worst Path {RL}, where the objective becomes to maximize the minimum possible cumulative reward. For Worst Path {RL}, we propose an efficient algorithm with constant upper and lower bounds. The techniques we develop for bounding the change of {CVaR} due to the value function shift and decomposing the regret via a distorted visitation distribution are novel, and can find applications in other risk-sensitive online learning problems.},

Training neural machine translation ({NMT}) models with traditional {FL} algorithm (e.g., {FedAvg}) typically relies on multi-round model-based interactions. However, it is impractical and inefficient for machine translation tasks due to the vast communication overheads and heavy synchronization. In this paper, we propose a novel federated nearest neighbor ({FedNN}) machine translation framework that, instead of multi-round model-based interactions, leverages one-round memorization-based interaction to share knowledge across different clients to build low-overhead privacy-preserving systems. The whole approach equips the public {NMT} model trained on large-scale accessible data with a $k$-nearest-neighbor ($k${NN}) classifier and integrates the external datastore constructed by private text data in all clients to form the final {FL} model. A two-phase datastore encryption strategy is introduced to achieve privacy-preserving during this process. Extensive experiments show that {FedNN} significantly reduces computational and communication costs compared with {FedAvg}, while maintaining promising performance in different {FL} settings.},

However, we find inequality phenomena occur during the $l_{\infty}$-adversarial training, that few features dominate the prediction made by the adversarially trained model. We systematically evaluate such inequality phenomena by extensive experiments and find such phenomena become more obvious when performing adversarial training with increasing adversarial strength. We hypothesize such inequality phenomena make $l_{\infty}$-adversarially trained model less reliable than the standard trained model when the few important features are influenced. To this end, we propose two simple attacks that either perturb important features with noise or occlude important features and demonstrate that our proposed attacks can easily fool adversarially trained models. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective method called Input Gradient Distillation ({IGD}) to release the inequality phenomena in $l_{\infty}$-adversarial training. We formally analyze and explain why the equality of the model's saliency map can improve such robustness.},

While the underlying neural mechanisms are not fully understood, various evidence supports that synaptic plasticity plays a critical role in memory formation and fast learning. In this work, we equip Recurrent Neural Networks ({RNN}s) with plasticity rules to enable them to adapt their parameters according to ongoing experiences. Concretely, we propose both the traditional local {Hebbian} plasticity and a novel global, gradient-based plasticity rule that allows the model to evolve towards its self-determined target. Our models show promising results on a variety of sequential and associative memory tasks, illustrating their ability to robustly form and retain memories, whilst also being able to cope with many challenging few-shot learning problems. By comparing different plasticity rules under the same experimental framework, we show that {Hebbian} plasticity is well-suited for several memory and associative learning tasks; however, it is outperformed by gradient-based plasticity on few-shot regression tasks which require the model to infer the underlying mapping.},

This issue is especially problematic for image-based RL, where a change in just one variable, such as the background colour, can change many pixels in the image. We introduce Temporal Disentanglement (TED), a self-supervised auxiliary task that leads to disentangled image representations by exploiting the sequential nature of RL observations. We find empirically that RL algorithms utilising TED as an auxiliary task adapt more quickly to changes in environment variables with continued training compared to state-of-the-art representation learning methods. Since TED enforces a disentangled structure of the representation, our experiments show that policies trained with TED generalise better to unseen values of variables irrelevant to the task (e.g. background colour) as well as unseen values of variables that affect the optimal policy (e.g. goal positions).},

Using a multimodal model with a joint image and language embedding space, our method LADS learns a transformation of the image embeddings from the source domain to each target domain, while preserving task relevant information. Without using any images from the target domain, we show that over the extended domain containing both source and target, LADS outperforms standard fine-tuning and ensemble approaches over a suite of 4 benchmarks targeting domain adaptation and dataset bias.},

Existing methods compare deterministic responses (e.g., hidden layer activations) or averaged responses (e.g., trial-averaged firing rates). However, these measures ignore the scale and geometric structure of noise, both of which play important roles in neural computation. To address this issue, we generalize previously proposed shape metrics to quantify differences in stochastic representations. We prove these metrics satisfy the triangle inequality and other standard metric properties. We then apply the metrics to supervised and unsupervised analyses of stochastic representation geometries in several neural network architectures. We find that the proposed metrics can identify important changes in representation geometry that existing methods miss, thus providing a more complete picture of learned representations.},

In this work, we first connect this DCI framework to two common notions of linear and nonlinear identifiability, thereby establishing a formal link between disentanglement and the closely-related field of independent component analysis. We then propose an extended {DCI-ES} framework with two new measures of representation quality---explicitness (E) and size (S)---and point out how D and C can be computed for black-box predictors. Our main idea is that the functional capacity required to use a representation is an important but thus-far neglected aspect of representation quality, which we quantify using explicitness or ease-of-use (E). We illustrate the relevance of our extensions on the {MPI3D} and {Cars3D} datasets.},

Popular algorithms based on stochastic policies, such as {SAC} or {MPO}, inject white noise by sampling actions from uncorrelated Gaussian distributions. In many tasks, however, white noise does not provide sufficient exploration, and temporally correlated noise is used instead. A common choice is Ornstein-Uhlenbeck ({OU}) noise, which is closely related to Brownian motion (red noise). Both red noise and white noise belong to the broad family of colored noise. In this work, we perform a comprehensive experimental evaluation on {MPO} and {SAC} to explore the effectiveness of other colors of noise as action noise. We find that pink noise, which is halfway between white and red noise, significantly outperforms white noise, {OU} noise, and other alternatives on a wide range of environments. Thus, we recommend it as the default choice for action noise in continuous control.},

Motivated by the idea that applications of strategic classification are often social in nature, we focus on graph neural networks, which make use of social relations between users to improve predictions. Using a graph for learning introduces inter-user dependencies in prediction; our key point is that strategic users can exploit these to promote their goals. As we show through analysis and simulation, this can work either against the system---or for it. Based on this, we propose a differentiable framework for strategically-robust learning of graph-based classifiers. Experiments on several real networked datasets demonstrate the utility of our approach.},

To this end, we study weight decay regularized training problems of deep neural networks with threshold activations. We first show that regularized deep threshold network training problems can be equivalently formulated as a standard convex optimization problem, which parallels the {LASSO} method, provided that the last hidden layer width exceeds a certain threshold. We also derive a simplified convex optimization formulation when the dataset can be shattered at a certain layer of the network.

We show that not only do replicable policies exist, but also they achieve almost the same optimal (non-replicable) regret bounds in terms of the time horizon. More specifically, in the stochastic multi-armed bandits setting, we develop a policy with an optimal problem-dependent regret bound whose dependence on the replicability parameter is also optimal. Similarly, for stochastic linear bandits (with finitely and infinitely many arms) we develop replicable policies that achieve the best-known problem-independent regret bounds with an optimal dependency on the replicability parameter. Our results show that even though randomization is crucial for the exploration-exploitation trade-off, an optimal balance can still be achieved while pulling the exact same arms in two different rounds of executions.},

The optimization of calibration is essential to many online advertising recommendation systems because it directly affects the downstream bids in ads auctions and the amount of money charged to advertisers. Despite its importance, calibration optimization often suffers from a problem called "maximization bias". Maximization bias refers to the phenomenon that the maximum of predicted values overestimates the true maximum. The problem is introduced because the calibration is computed on the set selected by the prediction model itself. It persists even if unbiased predictions can be achieved on every datapoint and worsens when covariate shifts exist between the training and test sets. To mitigate this problem, we theorize the quantification of maximization bias and propose a variance-adjusting debiasing ({VAD}) meta-algorithm in this paper. The algorithm is efficient, robust, and practical as it is able to mitigate maximization bias problem under covariate shifts, without incurring additional online serving costs or compromising the ranking performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm using a state-of-the-art recommendation neural network model on a large-scale real-world dataset.},

  abstract     = {Safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving require robust object detection invariant to real-world domain shifts. Such shifts can be regarded as different domain styles, which can vary substantially due to environment changes and sensor noises, but deep models only know the training domain style. Such domain style gap impedes object detection generalization on diverse real-world domains. Existing classification domain generalization ({DG}) methods cannot effectively solve the robust object detection problem, because they either rely on multiple source domains with large style variance or destroy the content structures of the original images. In this paper, we analyze and investigate effective solutions to overcome domain style overfitting for robust object detection without the above shortcomings. Our method, dubbed as Normalization Perturbation ({NP}), perturbs the channel statistics of source domain low-level features to synthesize various latent styles, so that the trained detector becomes more robust to domain variations. This approach is motivated by the observation that feature channel statistics of the target domain images deviate around the source domain statistics. We further explore the style-sensitive channels for effective style synthesis. Normalization Perturbation only relies on a single source domain and is surprisingly simple and effective, contributing a practical solution by effectively adapting or generalizing classification {DG} methods to robust object detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for generalizing object detectors under real-world domain shifts.},

Our framework, called {NeRF} with Self-supervised Object Segmentation ({NeRF-SOS}), couples object segmentation and neural radiance field to segment objects in any view within a scene. By proposing a novel collaborative contrastive loss in both appearance and geometry levels, {NeRF-SOS} encourages {NeRF} models to distill compact geometry-aware segmentation clusters from their dense representations. The self-supervised object segmentation framework can be applied to various {NeRF} models that both lead to photo-realistic rendering results and convincing segmentation maps for both indoor and outdoor scenarios. Extensive results on the {LLFF}, {BlendedMVS}, {CO3Dv2}, and Tank \& Temples datasets validate the effectiveness of {NeRF-SOS}. It consistently surpasses other 2D-based self-supervised baselines and predicts finer object masks than existing supervised counterparts.},

  abstract     = {The structure of proteins involves 3D geometry of amino acid coordinates and 1D sequence of peptide chains. The 3D structure exhibits irregularity because amino acids are distributed unevenly in Euclidean space and their coordinates are continuous variables. In contrast, the 1D structure is regular because amino acids are arranged uniformly in the chains and their sequential positions (orders) are discrete variables. Moreover, geometric coordinates and sequential orders are in two types of spaces and their units of length are incompatible. These inconsistencies make it challenging to capture the 3D and 1D structures while avoiding the impact of sequence and geometry modeling on each other. This paper proposes a Continuous-Discrete Convolution ({CDConv}) that uses irregular and regular approaches to model the geometry and sequence structures, respectively. {CDConv} employs independent learnable weights for different regular sequential displacements but directly encodes geometric displacements due to their irregularity. In this way, {CDConv} significantly improves protein modeling by reducing the impact of geometric irregularity on sequence modeling. Extensive experiments on a range of tasks, including protein fold classification, enzyme reaction classification, gene ontology term prediction and enzyme commission number prediction, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed {CDConv}.},

  abstract     = {Exploration problem is one of the main challenges in deep reinforcement learning. Recent promising works try to handle the problem with population-based methods, which collect samples with diverse behaviors derived from a population of different exploratory policies. However, the behavior selection space is largely limited by the predefined policy population, which further limits the behavior diversity. In this work, we propose Learnable Behavioral Control (LBC), a general framework to control the behaviors in RL. LBC enables a significantly enlarged behavior selection space via formulating a hybrid behavior mapping from all policies in the population and constructs a unified learnable process for behavior selection. We integrate LBC into distributed off-policy actor-critic methods and achieve behavior control via optimizing the selection of the behavior mappings with bandit-based meta-controllers. Our agents achieve 10077.52\% mean human normalized score and surpass 24 human world records within 1B training frames in the Arcade Learning Environment, demonstrating significant state-of-the-art performance without degrading the sample efficiency.},

  abstract     = {We introduce Corrupted Image Modeling (CIM) for self-supervised visual pre-training. CIM uses an auxiliary generator with a small trainable BEiT to corrupt the input image instead of using artificial [MASK] tokens, where some patches are randomly selected and replaced with plausible alternatives sampled from the BEiT output distribution. Given this corrupted image, an enhancer network learns to either recover all the original image pixels, or predict whether each visual token is replaced by a generator sample or not. The generator and the enhancer are simultaneously trained and synergistically updated. After pre-training, the enhancer can be used as a high-capacity visual encoder for downstream tasks. CIM is a general and flexible visual pre-training framework that is suitable for various network architectures. For the first time, CIM demonstrates that both ViT and CNN can learn rich visual representations using a unified, non-Siamese framework. Experimental results show that our approach achieves compelling results in vision benchmarks, such as ImageNet classification and ADE20K semantic segmentation.},

Motivated by this, we devise a cross-layer attention mechanism, called multi-head recurrent layer attention (MRLA), that sends a query representation of the current layer to all previous layers to retrieve query-related information from different levels of receptive fields. A light-weighted version of MRLA is also proposed to reduce the quadratic computation cost. The proposed layer attention mechanism can enrich the representation power of many state-of-the-art vision networks, including CNNs and vision transformers. Its effectiveness has been extensively evaluated in image classification, object detection and instance segmentation tasks, where improvements can be consistently observed.},

Despite the popularity of DP-SGD-GC, its convergence in unbounded domain without the Lipschitz continuous assumption is less-understood; existing analysis of DP-SGD-GC either impose additional assumptions or end up with an utility bound that involves an non-vanishing bias term. In this work, for smooth and unconstrained problems, we improve the current analysis and show that DP-SGD-GC can achieve a vanishing utility bound without any bias term. Furthermore, when the noise generated from subsampled gradients is light-tailed, we prove that DP-SGD-GC can achieve nearly the same utility bound as DP-SGD applies to the Lipschitz continuous objectives. As a by-product, we propose a new clipping technique, called value clipping, to mitigate the computational overhead caused by the classic gradient clipping. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets are conducted to support our analysis.},

  abstract     = {Auxiliary tasks improve the representations learned by deep reinforcement learning agents. Analytically, their effect is reasonably well understood; in practice, however, their primary use remains in support of a main learning objective, rather than as a method for learning representations. This is perhaps surprising given that many auxiliary tasks are defined procedurally, and hence can be treated as an essentially infinite source of information about the environment. Based on this observation, we study the effectiveness of auxiliary tasks for learning rich representations, focusing on the setting where the number of tasks and the size of the agent's network are simultaneously increased. For this purpose, we derive a new family of auxiliary tasks based on the successor measure. These tasks are easy to implement and have appealing theoretical properties. Combined with a suitable off-policy learning rule, the result is a representation learning algorithm that can be understood as extending Mahadevan \& Maggioni (2007)'s proto-value functions to deep reinforcement learning -- accordingly, we call the resulting object proto-value networks. Through experiments on the Arcade Learning Environment, we demonstrate that proto-value networks produce rich features that may be used to obtain performance comparable to established algorithms, using only linear approximation and a small number of interactions with the environment's reward function.},

In this paper, we challenge the aforementioned methods. The results suggest that the superior performance of state-of-the-art methods is owed to training a more generalizable classifier rather than their proposed selection mechanisms. We argue that the best performing selection mechanism should instead be rooted in the classifier itself. Our proposed selection strategy uses the classification scores and achieves better results by a significant margin, consistently, across all coverages and all datasets, without any added compute cost.},

Previous state-of-the-art method Transformer Neural Processes (TNPs) achieve strong performance but require quadratic computation with respect to the number of context datapoints, significantly limiting its scalability. Conversely, existing sub-quadratic NP variants perform significantly worse than that of TNPs. Tackling this issue, we propose Latent Bottlenecked Attentive Neural Processes (LBANPs), a new computationally efficient sub-quadratic NP variant, that has a querying computational complexity independent of the number of context datapoints. The model encodes the context dataset into a constant number of latent vectors on which self-attention is performed. When making predictions, the model retrieves higher-order information from the context dataset via multiple cross-attention mechanisms on the latent vectors. We empirically show that LBANPs achieve results competitive with the state-of-the-art on meta-regression, image completion, and contextual multi-armed bandits. We demonstrate that LBANPs can trade-off the computational cost and performance according to the number of latent vectors. Finally, we show LBANPs can scale beyond existing attention-based NP variants to larger dataset settings.},

Despite their ability to generate high-quality yet creative images, we observe that attribution-binding and compositional capabilities are still considered major challenging issues, especially when involving multiple objects. In this work, we improve the compositional skills of T2I models, specifically more accurate attribute binding and better image compositions. To do this, we incorporate linguistic structures with the diffusion guidance process based on the controllable properties of manipulating cross-attention layers in diffusion-based T2I models. We observe that keys and values in cross-attention layers have strong semantic meanings associated with object layouts and content. Therefore, we can better preserve the compositional semantics in the generated image by manipulating the cross-attention representations based on linguistic insights. Built upon Stable Diffusion, a SOTA T2I model, our structured cross-attention design is efficient that requires no additional training samples. We achieve better compositional skills in qualitative and quantitative results, leading to a 5-8\% advantage in head-to-head user comparison studies. Lastly, we conduct an in-depth analysis to reveal potential causes of incorrect image compositions and justify the properties of cross-attention layers in the generation process.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) for temporal graphs have recently attracted increasing attentions, where a common assumption is that the class set for nodes is closed. However, in real-world scenarios, it often faces the open set problem with the dynamically increased class set as the time passes by. This will bring two big challenges to the existing dynamic GNN methods: (i) How to dynamically propagate appropriate information in an open temporal graph, where new class nodes are often linked to old class nodes. This case will lead to a sharp contradiction. This is because typical GNNs are prone to make the embeddings of connected nodes become similar, while we expect the embeddings of these two interactive nodes to be distinguishable since they belong to different classes. (ii) How to avoid catastrophic knowledge forgetting over old classes when learning new classes occurred in temporal graphs. In this paper, we propose a general and principled learning approach for open temporal graphs, called OTGNet, with the goal of addressing the above two challenges. We assume the knowledge of a node can be disentangled into class-relevant and class-agnostic one, and thus explore a new message passing mechanism by extending the information bottleneck principle to only propagate class-agnostic knowledge between nodes of different classes, avoiding aggregating conflictive information. Moreover, we devise a strategy to select both important and diverse triad sub-graph structures for effective class-incremental learning. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets of different domains demonstrate the superiority of our method, compared to the baselines.},

Specifically, we introduce two generalized objectives for reward-function learning, inspired by the classical learning-to-rank literature. Further, we utilize the learned reward function to guide the training of the E2E ToD agent.

  abstract     = {The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (SLTH) stipulates the existence of a subnetwork within a sufficiently overparameterized (dense) neural network that -- when initialized randomly and without any training -- achieves the accuracy of a fully trained target network. Recent works by Da Cunha et. al 2022; Burkholz 2022 demonstrate that the SLTH can be extended to translation equivariant networks -- i.e. CNNs -- with the same level of overparametrization as needed for the SLTs in dense networks. However, modern neural networks are capable of incorporating more than just translation symmetry, and developing general equivariant architectures such as rotation and permutation has been a powerful design principle. In this paper, we generalize the SLTH to functions that preserve the action of the group $G$ -- i.e. $G$-equivariant network -- and prove, with high probability, that one can approximate any $G$-equivariant network of fixed width and depth by pruning a randomly initialized overparametrized $G$-equivariant network to a $G$-equivariant subnetwork. We further prove that our prescribed overparametrization scheme is optimal and provides a lower bound on the number of effective parameters as a function of the error tolerance. We develop our theory for a large range of groups, including subgroups of the Euclidean $\text{E}(2)$ and Symmetric group $G \leq \mathcal{S}_n$ -- allowing us to find SLTs for MLPs, CNNs, $\text{E}(2)$-steerable CNNs, and permutation equivariant networks as specific instantiations of our unified framework. Empirically, we verify our theory by pruning overparametrized $\text{E}(2)$-steerable CNNs, $k$-order GNNs, and message passing GNNs to match the performance of trained target networks.},

First, a neural network maps an image to a vector representation, that is relatively robust to various transformations of the image. Second, an efficient but approximate similarity search algorithm trades scalability (size and speed) against quality of the search, thereby introducing a source of error. This paper improves the robustness of image copy detection with active indexing, that optimizes the interplay of these two components. We reduce the quantization loss of a given image representation by making imperceptible changes to the image before its release. The loss is back-propagated through the deep neural network back to the image, under perceptual constraints. These modifications make the image more retrievable. Our experiments show that the retrieval and copy detection of activated images is significantly improved. For instance, activation improves by +40\% the Recall1@1 on various image transformations, and for several popular indexing structures based on product quantization and locality sensitivity hashing.},

They appear either in learning with multiple criteria where learning has to make a trade-off between multiple performance metrics such as fairness, safety and accuracy; or, in multi-task learning where multiple tasks are optimized jointly, sharing inductive bias between them. However, existing stochastic multi-objective gradient methods and their variants (e.g., MGDA, PCGrad, CAGrad, etc.) all adopt a biased noisy gradient direction, which leads to degraded empirical performance. To this end, we develop a stochastic multi-objective gradient correction (MoCo) method for multi-objective optimization. The unique feature of our method is that it can guarantee convergence without increasing the batch size even in the nonconvex setting. We introduce a new method for MOO that we call stochastic Multi-objective gradient with Correction (MoCo) method. MoCo is a simple algorithm that addresses the convergence issues of stochastic MGDA and provably converges to a Pareto stationary point under several stochastic MOO settings.},

Building on these insights, we develop Neural-IVP, an ODE based IVP solver which prevents the network from getting ill-conditioned and runs in time linear in the number of parameters, enabling us to evolve the dynamics of challenging PDEs with neural networks.},

This is problematic because VAEs need both high likelihood with respect to the prior and separation between points for better reconstruction, but the small high-density region restricts latent point separation. We propose a simple generalization of the Gaussian distribution called the tilted Gaussian, whose maximum probability density occurs on a sphere instead of a single point. The tilted Gaussian has exponentially more volume in high-density regions than the standard Gaussian as a function of the distribution dimension. We empirically demonstrate that this simple change in the prior distribution improves VAE performance on the task of detecting unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We also introduce a new OOD testing procedure called the Will-It-Move test, where the tilted Gaussian achieves remarkable OOD performance.},

  abstract     = {Current Symbolic Regression (SR) algorithms typically use man-made heuristics to influence the morphology of expressions in the search space, which may introduce unintentional bias and data leakage. To address this, we formulate a novel minimalistic approach based on constructing a depth-aware mathematical language model trained on terminal walks of expression trees, as a replacement to these heuristics. Current SR algorithms also tend to select expressions based on only a single fitness function. We promote the use of an adaptability framework in evolutionary SR which uses fitness functions that alternate across generations. We demonstrate this by alternating fitness functions that quantify faithfulness to values (via MSE) and empirical derivatives (via a novel theoretically justified fitness metric coined MSEDI). We combine these ideas into a minimalistic evolutionary SR algorithm that outperforms all benchmark and state-of-the-art SR algorithms in problems with unknown constants added, which are more reflective of SR performance for real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks may easily memorize noisy labels present in real-world data, which degrades their ability to generalize. It is therefore important to track and evaluate model robustness against noisy label memorization. We propose a metric called susceptibility to gauge memorization in neural networks. This metric is simple and easy to compute during training. Importantly, it does not require access to ground-truth labels and only uses unlabeled data. We show that this metric together with overall training accuracy can distinguish models with low label noise memorization on the training set and high generalization to unseen data. Our proposed approach outperforms existing methods for tracking memorization and provides practical benefits for model selection and evaluation.},

While most industrial uses of FL are for text applications, nearly all attacks on FL privacy have focused on simple image classifiers. We propose a novel attack that reveals private user text by deploying malicious parameter vectors, which succeeds even with mini-batches, multiple users, and long sequences. Unlike previous attacks on FL, this attack exploits characteristics of both the Transformer architecture and the token embedding, separately extracting tokens and positional embeddings to retrieve high-fidelity text. This work suggests that FL on text, which has historically been resistant to privacy attacks, is far more vulnerable than previously thought.},

However, its applicability remains unexplored in unsupervised learning, whereby the knowledge of the task matures during training. We propose a novel HYperbolic Self-Paced model (HYSP) for learning skeleton-based action representations. HYSP adopts self-supervision: it uses data augmentations to generate two views of the same sample, and it learns by matching one (named online) to the other (the target). We propose to use hyperbolic uncertainty to determine the algorithmic learning pace, under the assumption that less uncertain samples should be more strongly driving the training. Hyperbolic uncertainty is a by-product of the adopted hyperbolic neural networks, it matures during training and comes with no extra cost compared to existing approaches.},

To take a step towards addressing this research bottleneck, we present Powderworld, a lightweight yet expressive simulation environment running directly on the GPU. Within Powderworld, we present two motivating challenge distributions, one for world-modelling and one for reinforcement learning. Each contains hand-designed test tasks to examine generalization. Experiments indicate that increasing the environment's complexity improves generalization for world models and certain reinforcement learning agents, yet may inhibit learning in high-variance environments.},

  abstract     = {Generative Pre-trained Transformer models, known as GPT or OPT, set themselves apart through breakthrough performance across complex language modelling tasks, but also by their extremely high computational and storage costs. Specifically, due to their massive size, even inference for large, highly-accurate GPT models may require multiple performant GPUs, which limits the usability of such models. While there is emerging work on relieving this pressure via model compression, the applicability and performance of existing compression techniques is limited by the scale and complexity of GPT models. In this paper, we address this challenge, and propose OPTQ, a new one-shot weight quantization method based on approximate second-order information, that is both highly-accurate and highly-efficient. We show that Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models can be quantized down to 3-4 bits without significant loss of accuracy, which leads to significant computational and usability improvements. Specifically, OPTQ can quantize GPT models with 175 billion parameters in approximately four GPU hours, reducing the bitwidth down to 3 or 4 bits per weight, with negligible accuracy degradation relative to the uncompressed baseline. Our method more than doubles the compression gains relative to previously-proposed one-shot quantization methods, preserving accuracy, allowing us for the first time to execute an 175 billion-parameter model inside a single GPU for generative inference. Moreover, we also show that our method can still provide reasonable accuracy in the extreme quantization regime, in which weights are quantized to 2-bit or even ternary quantization levels. We show experimentally that these improvements can be leveraged for end-to-end inference speedups over FP16, of around 3.25x when using high-end GPUs (NVIDIA A100) and 4.5x when using more cost-effective ones (NVIDIA A6000).},

In the absence of ground truth data we can train our model with observations from real-world capture setups instead of relying on synthetic reconstructions. We make this unsupervised training approach possible by first generating an initial prototype volume which is then moved and transported over time without the need for volumetric supervision. Our approach relies purely on image-based losses, an adversarial discriminator network, and regularization. Our method can estimate long-term sequences in a stable manner, while achieving closely matching targets for inputs such as rising smoke plumes.},

Such settings are widespread in medicine (e.g., trials where the treatment assignment is used as binary IV). In this paper, we propose a novel, multiply robust machine learning framework, called MRIV, for estimating CATEs using binary IVs and thus yield an unbiased CATE estimator. Different from previous work for binary IVs, our framework estimates the CATE directly via a pseudo outcome regression.},

Moreover, this network is an ℓ₂-max-margin solution (in parameter space), and has a linear decision boundary that corresponds to an approximate-max-margin linear predictor.},

InCoder is trained to generate code files from a large corpus of permissively licensed code, where regions of code have been randomly masked and moved to the end of each file, allowing code infilling with bidirectional context. Our model is the first generative model that is able to directly perform zero-shot code infilling, which we evaluate on challenging tasks such as type inference, comment generation, and variable re-naming. We find that the ability to condition on bidirectional context substantially improves performance on these tasks, while still performing comparably on standard program synthesis benchmarks in comparison to left-to-right only models pretrained at similar scale.},

  abstract     = {State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2× speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4× faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.},

We show uniformly stable algorithms guarantee high-probability generalization bounds of the order O(1/√n) (within a logarithmic factor), where n is the sample size. We apply our general result to specific algorithms including regularization schemes, stochastic gradient descent and localized iterative regularization, and develop excess population risk bounds for learning with ψ-mixing data. Our analysis builds on a novel moment bound for weakly-dependent random variables on a ψ-mixing sequence and a novel error decomposition of generalization error.},

Existing work shows that when prompted with a chain of thoughts (CoT), sequences of short sentences describing intermediate reasoning steps towards a final answer, large language models can generate new reasoning chains and predict answers for new inputs. A central question is which reasoning examples make the most effective prompts. In this work, we propose complexity-based prompting, a simple and effective example selection scheme for multi-step reasoning. We further extend our complexity-based criteria from prompting (selecting inputs) to decoding (selecting outputs), where we sample multiple reasoning chains from the model, then choose the majority of generated answers from complex reasoning chains (over simple chains). When used to prompt GPT-3, our approach substantially improves multi-step reasoning accuracy, with an 8.6% absolute improvement on GSM8K, and 6.4% on MathQA. Compared with existing example selection schemes like manual tuning or retrieval-based selection, selection based on reasoning complexity is intuitive, easy to implement, and annotation-efficient. Further results demonstrate the robustness of performance gains from complex prompts under format perturbation and distribution shift.},

HiP-MDP is a natural model for families of tasks in which meta- and lifelong-reinforcement learning approaches can succeed. Given a learned context encoder that infers the hidden parameters from previous experience, most existing algorithms fall into two categories: model transfer and policy transfer, depending on which function the hidden parameters are used to parameterize. We characterize the robustness of model and policy transfer algorithms with respect to hidden parameter estimation error. We first show that the value function of HiP-MDPs is Lipschitz continuous under certain conditions. We then derive regret bounds for both settings through the lens of Lipschitz continuity. Finally, we empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis by experimentally varying the hyper-parameters governing the Lipschitz constants of two continuous control problems; the resulting performance is consistent with our predictions.},

In order to align input-output (IO) interface among multiple tasks and diverse agent morphologies while preserving essential 3D geometric relations, we introduce morphology-task graph, which treats observations, actions and goals/task in a unified graph representation. We also develop MxT-Bench for fast large-scale behavior generation, which supports procedural generation of diverse morphology-task combinations with a minimal blueprint and hardware-accelerated simulator. Through efficient representation and architecture selection on MxT-Bench, we find out that a morphology-task graph representation coupled with Transformer architecture improves the multi-task performances compared to other baselines including recent discrete tokenization, and provides better prior knowledge for zero-shot transfer or sample efficiency in downstream multi-task imitation learning. Our work suggests large diverse offline datasets, unified IO representation, and policy representation and architecture selection through supervised learning form a promising approach for studying and advancing morphology-task generalization.},

Notably, we find evidence that a *single* word embedding is sufficient for capturing unique and varied concepts.

Moreover, we find a subset of ViT models that outperform any other models in terms of uncertainty estimation performance. For example, we discovered an unprecedented 99% top-1 selective accuracy on ImageNet at 47% coverage (and 95% top-1 accuracy at 80%) for a ViT model, whereas a competing EfficientNet-V2-XL cannot obtain these accuracy constraints at any level of coverage.},

  abstract     = {We currently do not have an understanding of semi-supervised learning (SSL) objectives such as pseudo-labelling and entropy minimization as log-likelihoods, which precludes the development of e.g. Bayesian SSL. Here, we note that benchmark image datasets such as CIFAR-10 are carefully curated, and we formulate SSL objectives as a log-likelihood in a generative model of data curation. We show that SSL objectives, from entropy minimization and pseudo-labelling, to state-of-the-art techniques similar to FixMatch can be understood as lower-bounds on our principled log-likelihood. We are thus able to introduce a Bayesian extension of SSL, which gives considerable improvements over standard SSL in the setting of 40 labelled points on CIFAR-10, with performance of $92.2\pm 0.3\%$ vs $88.6\%$ in the original FixMatch paper. Finally, our theory suggests that SSL is effective in part due to the statistical patterns induced by data curation. This provides an explanation of past results which show SSL performs better on clean datasets without any ``out of distribution'' examples. Confirming these results we find that SSL gave much larger performance improvements on curated than on uncurated data, using matched curated and uncurated datasets based on Galaxy Zoo 2.},

To address these issues, we propose PiFold, which contains a novel residue featurizer and PiGNN layers to generate protein sequences in a one-shot way with improved recovery. Experiments show that PiFold could achieve 51.66% recovery on CATH 4.2, while the inference speed is 70 times faster than the autoregressive competitors. In addition, PiFold achieves 58.72% and 60.42% recovery scores on TS50 and TS500, respectively. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to reveal the role of different types of protein features and model designs, inspiring further simplification and improvement.

To this end, RePro addresses the two technical challenges of Open-VidVRD: 1) the prompt tokens should respect the two different semantic roles of subject and object, and 2) the tuning should account for the diverse spatiotemporal motion patterns of the subject-object compositions. Our RePro achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on two VidVRD benchmarks of not only the base training object and predicate categories, but also the unseen ones. Extensive ablations also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed compositional and multi-mode design of prompt. Code is available at https://github.com/Dawn-LX/OpenVoc-VidVRD.},

  abstract     = {Equipping predicted segmentation with calibrated uncertainty is essential for safety-critical applications. In this work, we focus on capturing the data-inherent uncertainty (aka aleatoric uncertainty) in segmentation, typically when ambiguities exist in input images. Due to the high-dimensional output space and potential multiple modes in segmenting ambiguous images, it remains challenging to predict well-calibrated uncertainty for segmentation. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel mixture of stochastic experts (MoSE) model, where each expert network estimates a distinct mode of the aleatoric uncertainty and a gating network predicts the probabilities of an input image being segmented in those modes. This yields an efficient two-level uncertainty representation. To learn the model, we develop a Wasserstein-like loss that directly minimizes the distribution distance between the MoSE and ground truth annotations. The loss can easily integrate traditional segmentation quality measures and be efficiently optimized via constraint relaxation. We validate our method on the LIDC-IDRI dataset and a modified multimodal Cityscapes dataset. Results demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art or competitive performance on all metrics.},

While such generalization significantly speeds up training, each energy evaluation still requires Monte Carlo integration which limits the evaluation to a few geometries. In this work, we address the inference shortcomings by proposing the Potential learning from ab-initio Networks (PlaNet) framework, in which we simultaneously train a surrogate model in addition to the neural wave function. At inference time, the surrogate avoids expensive Monte-Carlo integration by directly estimating the energy, accelerating the process from hours to milliseconds. In this way, we can accurately model high-resolution multi-dimensional energy surfaces for larger systems that previously were unobtainable via neural wave functions. Finally, we explore an additional inductive bias by introducing physically-motivated restricted neural wave function models. We implement such a function with several additional improvements in the new PESNet++ model. In our experimental evaluation, PlaNet accelerates inference by 7 orders of magnitude for larger molecules like ethanol while preserving accuracy. Compared to previous energy surface networks, PESNet++ reduces energy errors by up to 74%.},

  abstract     = {Model-based methods have recently shown great potential for off-policy evaluation (OPE); offline trajectories induced by behavioral policies are fitted to transitions of Markov decision processes (MDPs), which are used to rollout simulated trajectories and estimate the performance of policies. Model-based OPE methods face two key challenges. First, as offline trajectories are usually fixed, they tend to cover limited state and action space. Second, the performance of model-based methods can be sensitive to the initialization of their parameters. In this work, we propose the variational latent branching model (VLBM) to learn the transition function of MDPs by formulating the environmental dynamics as a compact latent space, from which the next states and rewards are then sampled. Specifically, VLBM leverages and extends the variational inference framework with the recurrent state alignment (RSA), which is designed to capture as much information underlying the limited training data, by smoothing out the information flow between the variational (encoding) and generative (decoding) part of VLBM. Moreover, we also introduce the branching architecture to improve the model's robustness against randomly initialized model weights. The effectiveness of the VLBM is evaluated on the deep OPE (DOPE) benchmark, from which the training trajectories are designed to result in varied coverage of the state-action space. We show that the VLBM outperforms existing state-of-the-art OPE methods in general.},

  abstract     = {There is a rising interest in further exploring the zero-shot learning potential of large pre-trained language models (PLMs). A new paradigm called data-generation-based zero-shot learning has achieved impressive success. In this paradigm, the synthesized data from the PLM acts as the carrier of knowledge, which is used to train a task-specific model with orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the PLM, achieving both higher performance and efficiency than prompt-based zero-shot learning methods on PLMs. The main hurdle of this approach is that the synthesized data from PLM usually contains a significant portion of low-quality samples. Fitting on such data will greatly hamper the performance of the task-specific model, making it unreliable for deployment. Previous methods remedy this issue mainly by filtering synthetic data using heuristic metrics(e.g., output confidence), or refining the data with the help of a human expert, which comes with excessive manual tuning or expensive costs. In this paper, we propose a novel noise-robust re-weighting framework SunGen to automatically construct high-quality data for zero-shot classification problems. Our framework features the ability to learn the sample weights indicating data quality without requiring any human annotation. We theoretically and empirically verify the ability of our method to help construct good-quality synthetic datasets. Notably, SunGen-LSTM yields a 9.8% relative improvement than the baseline on average accuracy across eight different established text classification tasks.},

However, CLIP does not explicitly capture the hierarchical nature of high-level and fine-grained semantics conveyed in images and texts, which is arguably critical to vision-language understanding and reasoning. To this end, we equip both the visual and language branches in CLIP with hierarchy-aware attentions, namely Hierarchy-aware CLIP (HiCLIP), to progressively discover semantic hierarchies layer-by-layer from both images and texts in an unsupervised manner. As a result, such hierarchical aggregation significantly improves the cross-modal alignment. To demonstrate the advantages of HiCLIP, we conduct qualitative analysis on its unsupervised hierarchy induction during inference, as well as extensive quantitative experiments on both visual recognition and vision-language downstream tasks.},

This work provides the first sub-linear regret and sub-linear constraint violation for constrained MDP for linear function approximation using model-free RL algorithm. The paper presents two main algorithmic contributions: 1) A computationally inefficient algorithm that achieves Õ(√(d³T)) regret and constraint violation, where T is the number of interactions and d is the dimension of the feature mapping. 2) An efficient variant based on the primal-dual adaptation of the LSVI-UCB algorithm that achieves Õ((dT)³/⁴) regret and constraint violation. This improves upon the known regret bound of Õ(T⁵/⁶) for the finite state-space model-free constrained RL which was obtained under a stronger assumption compared to theirs.},

  abstract     = {There is growing interest in understanding how real brains may approximate gradients and how gradients can be used to train neuromorphic chips. However, neither real brains nor neuromorphic chips can perfectly follow the loss gradient, so parameter updates would necessarily use gradient estimators that have some variance and/or bias. Therefore, there is a need to understand better how variance and bias in gradient estimators impact learning dependent on network and task properties. Here, we show that variance and bias can impair learning on the training data, but some degree of variance and bias in a gradient estimator can be beneficial for generalization. We find that the ideal amount of variance and bias in a gradient estimator are dependent on several properties of the network and task: the size and activity sparsity of the network, the norm of the gradient, and the curvature of the loss landscape.},

A natural question to ask is "Does the momentum parameter β (say) play a role in implicit regularization in Heavy-ball (H.B) momentum accelerated gradient descent (GD+M)?". To answer this question, first, we show that the trajectory traced by discrete H.B momentum update (GD+M) is O(h²) close to a continuous trajectory induced by a modified loss, which consists of an original loss and an implicit regularizer. This implicit regularizer for (GD+M) is indeed stronger than that of (GD) by factor of ((1+β)/(1-β)), thus explaining why (GD+M) shows better generalization performance and higher test accuracy than (GD). Furthermore, we extend our analysis to stochastic version of gradient descent with momentum (SGD+M) and propose a deterministic continuous trajectory that is O(h²) close to the discrete update of (SGD+M).},

Prior work has addressed this challenge by learning low-dimensional representation of observations through auxiliary objectives, such as reconstruction or value prediction. However, the alignment between these auxiliary objectives and the RL objective is often unclear. In this work, we propose a single objective which jointly optimizes a latent-space model and policy to achieve high returns while remaining self-consistent. This objective is a lower bound on expected returns. Unlike prior bounds for model-based RL on policy exploration or model guarantees, our bound is directly on the overall RL objective.},

While methods exist for detecting when predictions should not be made on out-of-distribution test examples, identifying distributional level differences between training and test time can help determine when a model should be removed from the deployment setting and retrained. In this work, we define harmful covariate shift (HCS) as a change in distribution that may weaken the generalization of a predictive model and propose the Detectron, a method based that detects covariate shift using an ensemble of classifiers trained to disagree with each other on unlabeled samples. We derive a loss function for training this ensemble and show that the disagreement rate and entropy represent powerful discriminative statistics for HCS. Empirically, we demonstrate the ability of our method to detect harmful covariate shift with statistical certainty on a variety of high-dimensional datasets. Across numerous domains and modalities, we show state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods, particularly when the number of observed test samples is small.},

The method constructs a joint training objective that penalizes the self-information of network parameters in a reparameterized latent space to encourage small model size while also introducing priors to increase structured sparsity in the parameter space to reduce computation. The paper demonstrates impressive results: when compared with existing state-of-the-art model compression methods, they achieve up to 50% smaller model size and 98% model sparsity on ResNet-20 on the CIFAR-10 dataset as well as 37% smaller model size and 71% structured sparsity on ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet while retaining the same accuracy as those methods. The resulting sparsity can improve the inference time of the models by almost 1.8 times the dense ResNet-50 baseline model.},

  abstract     = {A major challenge in modern machine learning is theoretically understanding the generalization properties of overparameterized models. Many existing tools rely on uniform convergence (UC), a property that, when it holds, guarantees that the test loss will be close to the training loss, uniformly over a class of candidate models. Nagarajan and Kolter (2019) show that in certain simple linear and neural-network settings, any uniform convergence bound will be vacuous, leaving open the question of how to prove generalization in settings where UC fails. Our main contribution is proving novel generalization bounds in two such settings, one linear, and one non-linear. We study the linear classification setting of Nagarajan and Kolter (2019), and a quadratic ground truth function learned via a two-layer neural network in the non-linear setting. We prove a new type of margin bound showing that above a certain signal-to-noise threshold, any near-max-margin classifier will achieve almost no test loss in these two settings. Our results show that near-max-margin is important: while any model that achieves at least a (1 - ε)-fraction of the max-margin generalizes well, a classifier achieving half of the max-margin may fail terribly. Our analysis provides insight on why memorization can coexist with generalization: we show that in this challenging regime where generalization occurs but UC fails, near-max-margin classifiers simultaneously contain some generalizable components and some overfitting components that memorize the data. The presence of the overfitting components is enough to preclude UC, but the near-extremal margin guarantees that sufficient generalizable components are present.},

This equation can be solved *from first principles*, requiring no external training data. In recent years, deep neural networks like the FermiNet and PauliNet have been used to significantly improve the accuracy of these first-principle calculations, but they lack an attention-like mechanism for gating interactions between electrons. Here we show that the PsiFormer can be used as a drop-in replacement for these other neural networks, often dramatically improving the accuracy of the calculations. On larger molecules especially, the ground state energy can be improved by dozens of kcal/mol, a qualitative leap over previous methods. This demonstrates that self-attention networks can learn complex quantum mechanical correlations between electrons, and are a promising route to reaching unprecedented accuracy in chemical calculations on larger systems.},

We simply do not know how often the stated reasoning steps actually support the final end task predictions. In this work, we present ROSCOE, a suite of interpretable, unsupervised automatic scores that improve and extend previous text generation evaluation metrics. To evaluate ROSCOE against baseline metrics, we design a typology of reasoning errors and collect synthetic and human evaluation scores on commonly used reasoning datasets. In contrast with existing metrics, ROSCOE can measure semantic consistency, logicality, informativeness, fluency, and factuality --- among other traits --- by leveraging properties of step-by-step rationales. We empirically verify the strength of our metrics on five human annotated and six programmatically perturbed diagnostics datasets - covering a diverse set of tasks that require reasoning skills and show that ROSCOE can consistently outperform baseline metrics.},

  abstract     = {Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a new paradigm for generative models. Despite the success in domains using continuous signals such as vision and audio, adapting diffusion models to natural language is under-explored due to the discrete nature of texts, especially for conditional generation. We tackle this challenge by proposing DiffuSeq: a diffusion model designed for sequence-to-sequence text generation tasks. Our method is non-autoregressive, iterative, and denoising just like diffusion models for continuous data, but we adapt it to discrete text by introducing a new diffusion process that operates at the word level. We evaluate DiffuSeq on a variety of conditional sequence generation tasks including paraphrasing, text simplification and question generation. Experiments show that DiffuSeq achieves comparable or even better performance than six competitive baselines, including a state-of-the-art autoregressive model that is 3$\times$ larger. Apart from quality, an advantage of our method is controllability. DiffuSeq allows for more diversity during decoding by adjusting hyperparameters of the diffusion process without any re-training. We also propose a new evaluation protocol to better assess the diversity-quality trade-off and find that DiffuSeq achieves a better balance than baselines.},

In this work, we conduct a systematic study of robustness in graph machine learning and show that commonly used perturbation models are fundamentally flawed. Specifically, we investigate the symmetry property, which requires that the model be robust to structural changes that do not alter the graph's semantic content. We identify perturbation models that violate this requirement and show that state-of-the-art methods for generating adversarial examples produce a high fraction of such invalid perturbations. Additionally, we demonstrate that the assessed graph neural networks show over-robustness, that is robustness beyond the point of semantic changes. We then show that the observed over-robustness is a limiting factor in the performance of graph neural networks, and propose to include label-structure during training and inference to improve robustness and test accuracy simultaneously.},

We propose three classes of surrogate (unsupervised) metrics that can be used for model selection: prediction error, model centrality, and performance on injected synthetic anomalies. We show that some of these metrics can be useful for model selection even when used individually. We then show how to combine these metrics with rank aggregation techniques for a better selection. In a large-scale study across 160+ models and 50+ datasets, we show that our approach is as effective as using labeled validation data to select the best model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically study model selection for anomaly detection with a focus on time-series data.},

Given the fact that the learned representations are L²-normalized, we show that DINO and its derivatives, such as iBOT, can be interpreted as a mixture model of von Mises-Fisher components. With this interpretation, DINO assumes equal precision for all components when the prototypes are also L²-normalized. Using this insight we propose DINO-vMF, that adds appropriate normalization constants when computing the cluster assignment probabilities. We demonstrate that the added flexibility of the mixture model is beneficial in terms of better image representations.

However, DGNs are typically limited in their ability to propagate and preserve long-term dependencies between nodes, i.e., they suffer from the over-squashing phenomena. This reduces their effectiveness, since predictive problems may require to capture interactions at different, and possibly large, radii in order to be effectively solved. In this work, we present Anti-Symmetric Deep Graph Networks (A-DGNs), a framework for stable and non-dissipative DGN design, conceived through the lens of ordinary differential equations. We give theoretical proof that our method is stable and non-dissipative, leading to two key results: long-range information between nodes is preserved, and no gradient vanishing or explosion occurs in training. We empirically validate the proposed approach on several graph benchmarks, showing that A-DGN yields to improved performance and enables to learn effectively even when dozens of layers are used.},

  abstract     = {Equivariance guarantees that a model's predictions capture key symmetries in data. When an image is translated or rotated, an equivariant model's representation of that image will translate or rotate accordingly. The success of convolutional neural networks has historically been tied to translation equivariance directly encoded in their architecture. The rising success of vision transformers, which have no explicit architectural bias towards equivariance, challenges this narrative and suggests that augmentations and training data might also play a significant role in their performance. In order to better understand the role of equivariance in recent vision models, we introduce the Lie derivative, a method for measuring equivariance with strong mathematical foundations and minimal hyperparameters. Using the Lie derivative, we study the equivariance properties of hundreds of pretrained models, spanning CNNs, transformers, and Mixer architectures. The scale of our analysis allows us to separate the impact of architecture from other factors like model size or training method. Surprisingly, we find that many violations of equivariance can be linked to spatial aliasing in ubiquitous network layers, such as pointwise non-linearities, and that as models get larger and more accurate they tend to display more equivariance, regardless of architecture. For example, transformers can be more equivariant than convolutional neural networks after training.},

  abstract     = {Linear time-invariant state space models ({SSM}) are a classical model from engineering and statistics, that have recently been shown to be very promising in machine learning through the Structured State Space sequence model ({S4}). A core component of {S4} involves initializing the {SSM} state matrix to a particular matrix called a {HiPPO} matrix, which was empirically important for {S4}'s ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that {S4} uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular *time-varying* dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a *time-invariant* {SSM} had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which {S4} models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the {HiPPO} framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of {S4} as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped {Legendre} polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of {SSMs} that also lets us derive more intuitive {S4} variants for other bases such as the {Fourier} basis, and explains other aspects of training {S4}, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve {S4}'s performance to 86\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96\% on the most difficult {Path-X} task.},

Standard {DMs} can be viewed as an instantiation of hierarchical variational autoencoders ({VAEs}) where the latent variables are inferred from input-centered {Gaussian} distributions with fixed scales and variances. Unlike {VAEs}, this formulation constrains {DMs} from changing the latent spaces and learning abstract representations. In this work, we propose f-{DM}, a generalized family of {DMs} which allows progressive signal transformation. More precisely, we extend {DMs} to incorporate a set of (hand-designed or learned) transformations, where the transformed input is the mean of each diffusion step. We propose a generalized formulation and derive the corresponding de-noising objective with a modified sampling algorithm. As a demonstration, we apply f-{DM} in image generation tasks with a range of functions, including down-sampling, blurring, and learned transformations based on the encoder of pretrained {VAEs}. In addition, we identify the importance of adjusting the noise levels whenever the signal is sub-sampled and propose a simple rescaling recipe. f-{DM} can produce high-quality samples on standard image generation benchmarks like {FFHQ}, {AFHQ}, {LSUN}, and {ImageNet} with better efficiency and semantic interpretation.},

Recently, the inclusion of 3D structures during targeted drug design shows superior performance to other target-free models as the atomic interaction in the 3D space is explicitly modeled. However, current 3D target-aware models either rely on the voxelized atom densities or the autoregressive sampling process, which are not equivariant to rotation or easily violate geometric constraints resulting in unrealistic structures. In this work, we develop a 3D equivariant diffusion model to solve the above challenges. To achieve target-aware molecule design, our method learns a joint generative process of both continuous atom coordinates and categorical atom types with a {SE}(3)-equivariant network. Moreover, we show that our model can serve as an unsupervised feature extractor to estimate the binding affinity under proper parameterization, which provides an effective way for drug screening. To evaluate our model, we propose a comprehensive framework to evaluate the quality of sampled molecules from different dimensions. Empirical studies show our model could generate molecules with more realistic 3D structures and better affinities towards the protein targets, and improve binding affinity ranking and prediction without retraining.},

Interactive reward learning from trajectory comparisons (a.k.a. {RLHF}) is one way to allow non-expert users to convey complex objectives by expressing preferences over short clips of agent behaviors. Even though this parametric method can encode complex tacit knowledge present in the underlying tasks, it implicitly assumes that the human is unable to provide richer feedback than binary preference labels, leading to intolerably high feedback complexity and poor user experience. Using this as motivation, we introduce the notion of Relative Behavioral Attributes, which allows the users to tweak the agent behavior through symbolic concepts (e.g., increasing the softness or speed of agents' movement). We propose two practical methods that can learn to model any kind of behavioral attributes from ordered behavior clips. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on four tasks with nine different behavioral attributes, showing that once the attributes are learned, end users can produce desirable agent behaviors relatively effortlessly, by providing feedback just around ten times. This is over an order of magnitude less than that required by the popular learning-from-human-preferences baselines.},

  abstract     = {Consider the problem of estimating the causal effect of some attribute of a text document; for example: what effect does writing a polite vs. rude email have on response time? To estimate a causal effect from observational data, we need to adjust for confounding aspects of the text that affect both the treatment and outcome---e.g., the topic or writing level of the text. These confounding aspects are unknown a priori, so it seems natural to adjust for the entirety of the text (e.g., using a transformer). However, causal identification and estimation procedures rely on the assumption of overlap: for all levels of the adjustment variables, there is randomness leftover so that every unit could have (not) received treatment. Since the treatment here is itself an attribute of the text, it is perfectly determined, and overlap is apparently violated. The purpose of this paper is to show how to handle causal identification and obtain robust causal estimation in the presence of apparent overlap violations. In brief, the idea is to use supervised representation learning to produce a data representation that preserves confounding information while eliminating information that is only predictive of the treatment. This representation then suffices for adjustment and satisfies overlap. Adapting results on non-parametric estimation, we show that this procedure shows robustness with respect to conditional outcome misestimation and yields a low-bias estimator that admits valid uncertainty quantification under weak conditions. Empirical results show reductions in bias and strong improvements in uncertainty quantification relative to the natural (transformer-based) baseline.},

Instead of characterizing oversmoothing from the view of complete collapse in which representations converge to a single point, we dive into a more general perspective dimensional collapse in which representations lie in a narrow cone. Accordingly, inspired by the power of contrastive learning in preventing dimensional collapse, we propose a novel normalization layer ContraNorm. Intuitively, ContraNorm implicitly shatters representations in the embedding space, leading to a more uniform distribution and slighter dimensional collapse. On the theoretical analysis, we prove that ContraNorm can alleviate both complete collapse and dimensional collapse under some conditions. Our proposed normalization layer can be easily inserted into GNNs and Transformers with negligible parameter overhead. Experiments on various real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of our method.},

Specifically, inspired by direct sampling methods for inverse problems, the 1D boundary data in different frequencies are preprocessed by a partial differential equation-based feature map to yield 2D harmonic extensions as different input channels. Then, by introducing learnable non-local kernels, the direct sampling is recast to a modified attention mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Tackling unfairness in graph learning models is a challenging task, as the unfairness issues on graphs involve both attributes and topological structures. Existing work on fair graph learning simply assumes that attributes of all nodes are available for model training and then makes fair predictions. In practice, however, the attributes of some nodes might not be accessible due to missing data or privacy concerns, which makes fair graph learning even more challenging. In this paper, we propose FairAC, a fair attribute completion method, to complement missing information and learn fair node embeddings for graphs with missing attributes. FairAC adopts an attention mechanism to deal with the attribute missing problem and meanwhile, it mitigates two types of unfairness, i.e., feature unfairness from attributes and topological unfairness due to attribute completion. FairAC can work on various types of homogeneous graphs and generate fair embeddings for them and thus can be applied to most downstream tasks to improve their fairness performance. To our best knowledge, FairAC is the first method that jointly addresses the graph attribution completion and graph unfairness problems. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method achieves better fairness performance with less sacrifice in accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art methods of fair graph learning.},

This paper extends the inference view and describes a variational inference formulation of federated learning where the goal is to find a global variational posterior that well-approximates the true posterior. This naturally motivates an expectation propagation approach to federated learning (FedEP), where approximations to the global posterior are iteratively refined through probabilistic message-passing between the central server and the clients. We conduct an extensive empirical study across various algorithmic considerations and describe practical strategies for scaling up expectation propagation to the modern federated setting. We apply FedEP on standard federated learning benchmarks and find that it outperforms strong baselines in terms of both convergence speed and accuracy.},

Neural Processes (NPs), which model the distributions over functions conditioned on partial observations (context set), provide a practical solution for fast inference of continuous functions. However, existing NP architectures suffer from inferior modeling capability for complex signals. In this paper, we propose an efficient NP framework dubbed Versatile Neural Processes (VNP), which largely increases the capability of approximating functions. Specifically, we introduce a bottleneck encoder that produces fewer and informative context tokens, relieving the high computational cost while providing high modeling capability. At the decoder side, we hierarchically learn multiple global latent variables that jointly model the global structure and the uncertainty of a function, enabling our model to capture the distribution of complex signals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VNP on a variety of tasks involving 1D, 2D and 3D signals. Particularly, our method shows promise in learning accurate INRs w.r.t. a 3D scene without further finetuning.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed a hidden backdoor trigger during the training process for malicious prediction manipulation. These attacks pose great threats to the applications of DNNs under the real-world machine learning as a service (MLaaS) setting, where the deployed model is fully black-box while the users can only query and obtain its predictions. Currently, there are many existing defenses to reduce backdoor threats. However, almost all of them cannot be adopted in MLaaS scenarios since they require getting access to or even modifying the suspicious models. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective black-box input-level backdoor detection, called SCALE-UP, which requires only the predicted labels to alleviate this problem. Specifically, we identify and filter malicious testing samples by analyzing their prediction consistency during the pixel-wise amplification process. Our defense is motivated by an intriguing observation (dubbed scaled prediction consistency) that the predictions of poisoned samples are significantly more consistent compared to those of benign ones when amplifying all pixel values. Besides, we also provide theoretical foundations to explain this phenomenon. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, verifying the effectiveness and efficiency of our defense and its resistance to potential adaptive attacks.},

This work shows that we can create good video prediction models by pre-training transformers via masked visual modeling. Our approach, named MaskViT, is based on two simple design decisions. First, for memory and training efficiency, we use two types of window attention: spatial and spatiotemporal. Second, during training, we mask a variable percentage of tokens instead of a fixed mask ratio. For inference, MaskViT generates all tokens via iterative refinement where we incrementally decrease the masking ratio following a mask scheduling function. On several datasets we demonstrate that MaskViT outperforms prior works in video prediction, is parameter efficient, and can generate high resolution videos ($256 \times 256$). Further, we demonstrate the benefits of inference speedup (up to $512 \times$) due to iterative decoding by using MaskViT for planning on a real robot. Our work suggests that we can endow embodied agents with powerful predictive models by leveraging the general framework of masked visual modeling with minimal domain knowledge.},

To coordinate the efforts of the research community toward tackling this problem, we propose a benchmark including: i) a large collection of data for offline learning from a dexterous manipulation platform on two tasks, obtained with capable RL agents trained in simulation; ii) the option to execute learned policies on a real-world robotic system and a simulation for efficient debugging. We evaluate prominent open-sourced offline reinforcement learning algorithms on the datasets and provide a reproducible experimental setup for offline reinforcement learning on real systems.},

  abstract     = {Dynamical systems with interacting agents are universal in nature, commonly modeled by a graph of relationships between their constituents. Recently, various works have been presented to tackle the problem of inferring those relationships from the system trajectories via deep neural networks, but most of the studies assume binary or discrete types of interactions for simplicity. In the real world, the interaction kernels often involve continuous interaction strengths, which cannot be accurately approximated by discrete relations. In this work, we propose the relational attentive inference network (RAIN) to infer continuously weighted interaction graphs without any ground-truth interaction strengths. Our model employs a novel pairwise attention (PA) mechanism to refine the trajectory representations and a graph transformer to extract heterogeneous interaction weights for each pair of agents. We show that our RAIN model with the PA mechanism accurately infers continuous interaction strengths for simulated physical systems in an unsupervised manner. Further, RAIN with PA successfully predicts trajectories from motion capture data with an interpretable interaction graph, demonstrating the virtue of modeling unknown dynamics with continuous weights.},

This limits the scope of conclusions that can be drawn from such experiments. Instead of removing noise, we propose to incorporate several sources of variance, including their interaction with data properties, into an analysis of significance and reliability of machine learning evaluation, with the aim to draw inferences beyond particular instances of trained models.},

We show that it is possible for an LM to synthesize programming problems and solutions, which are filtered for correctness by a Python interpreter. The LM's performance is then seen to improve when it is fine-tuned on its own synthetic problems and verified solutions; thus the model 'improves itself' using the Python interpreter.

However, it remains unclear how to combine such multi-view methods with the widely available 3D point clouds. Previous methods use unlearned heuristics to combine features at the point level. To this end, we introduce the concept of the multi-view point cloud (Voint cloud), representing each 3D point as a set of features extracted from several view-points. This novel 3D Voint cloud representation combines the compactness of 3D point cloud representation with the natural view-awareness of multi-view representation. Naturally, we can equip this new representation with convolutional and pooling operations. We deploy a Voint neural network (VointNet) to learn representations in the Voint space. Our novel representation achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D classification, shape retrieval, and robust 3D part segmentation on standard benchmarks (ScanObjectNN, ShapeNet Core55, and ShapeNet Parts). Further analysis shows that VointNet improves the robustness to occlusion compared to other methods.},

  abstract     = {Training graph neural networks (GNNs) on large graphs is complex and extremely time consuming. This is attributed to overheads caused by sparse matrix multiplication, which are sidestepped when training multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with only node features. MLPs, by ignoring graph context, are simple and faster for graph data, however they usually sacrifice prediction accuracy, limiting their applications for graph data. We observe that for most message passing-based GNNs, we can trivially derive an analog MLP (we call this a PeerMLP) with an equivalent weight space, by setting the trainable parameters with the same shapes, making us curious about how do GNNs using weights from a fully trained PeerMLP perform? Surprisingly, we find that GNNs initialized with such weights significantly outperform their PeerMLPs, motivating us to use PeerMLP training as a precursor, initialization step to GNN training. To this end, we propose an embarrassingly simple, yet hugely effective initialization method for GNN training acceleration, called MLPInit. Our extensive experiments on multiple large-scale graph datasets with diverse GNN architectures validate that MLPInit can accelerate the training of GNNs (up to 33× speedup on OGB-Products) and often improve prediction performance (e.g., up to 7.97% improvement for GraphSAGE across 7 datasets for node classification, and up to 17.81% improvement across 4 datasets for link prediction on metric Hits@10).},

We first show empirical observation that typical samples are close to each other and distinctive samples are far from each other in nearest-neighbor distances on latent spaces represented by feature extractor networks such as VGG16. We then show that one can effectively filter typical or distinctive samples with the proposed metric. We also use our metric to demonstrate that the extent to which different generative models produce rare images can be effectively compared.},

Concretely, our method first adopts Gaussian mixture distribution to estimate the prototypical clusters for all categories. Then we assign each cluster to the corresponding label by solving a weighted bipartite matching problem. Given an example, its prediction is calibrated by the likelihood of prototypical clusters. Experimental results show that prototypical calibration yields a substantial improvement on a diverse set of tasks. Extensive analysis across different scales also indicates that our method calibrates the decision boundary as expected, greatly improving the robustness of GPT to templates, permutations, and class imbalance.},

  abstract     = {Probabilistic logical rule learning has shown great strength in logical rule mining and knowledge graph completion. It learns logical rules to predict missing edges by reasoning on existing edges in the knowledge graph. However, previous efforts have largely been limited to only modeling chain-like Horn clauses such as $R_1(x,z)\land R_2(z,y)\Rightarrow H(x,y)$. This formulation overlooks additional contextual information from neighboring sub-graphs of entity variables $x$, $y$ and $z$. Intuitively, there is a large gap here, as local sub-graphs have been found to provide important information for knowledge graph completion. Inspired by these observations, we propose Logical Entity RePresentation (LERP) to encode contextual information of entities in the knowledge graph. A LERP is designed as a vector of probabilistic logical functions on the entity's neighboring sub-graph. It is an interpretable representation while allowing for differentiable optimization. We can then incorporate LERP into probabilistic logical rule learning to learn more expressive rules. Empirical results demonstrate that with LERP, our model outperforms other rule learning methods in knowledge graph completion and is comparable or even superior to state-of-the-art black-box methods. Moreover, we find that our model can discover a more expressive family of logical rules. LERP can also be further combined with embedding learning methods like TransE to make it more interpretable.},

Our computational results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves 51.1% and 9.9% performance improvements over Gurobi on NP-hard binary quadratic programming and maximum independent set instances, respectively.

Contrastive learning methods pull views of samples together and push different samples away, which utilizes semantic invariance of augmentation but ignores the relationship between samples. To better exploit the power of augmentation, we observe that semantically similar samples are more likely to have similar augmented views. Therefore, we can take the augmented views as a special description of a sample. In this paper, we model such a description as the augmentation distribution, and we call it augmentation feature. The similarity in augmentation feature reflects how much the views of two samples overlap and is related to their semantical similarity. Without computational burdens to explicitly estimate values of the augmentation feature, we propose Augmentation Component Analysis (ACA) with a contrastive-like loss to learn principal components and an on-the-fly projection loss to embed data. ACA equals an efficient dimension reduction by PCA and extracts low-dimensional embeddings, theoretically preserving the similarity of augmentation distribution between samples. Empirical results show that our method can achieve competitive results against various traditional contrastive learning methods on different benchmarks.}

For example, an answer to the Sudoku game, a structured code like s-expression, and even a logical natural language answer where the analysis may be generated after the decision. We define the target sequences of those tasks as complex sequences. Obviously, a complex sequence should be constructed with multiple logical steps, and has dependencies among each part of itself (e.g. decisions depend on analyses). It's a great challenge for the classic left-to-right autoregressive generation system to generate complex sequences. Current approaches improve one-pass left-to-right generation on NLG tasks by generating different heuristic intermediate sequences in multiple stages. However, for complex sequences, the heuristic rules to break down them may hurt performance, and increase additional exposure bias. To tackle these challenges, we propose a PLM-friendly autoregressive self-boost refinement framework, CASR. When training, CASR inputs the predictions generated by the model itself at the previous refinement step (instead of those produced by heuristic rules). To find an optimal design, we also discuss model architecture, parameter efficiency and initialization strategy. By evaluating CASR on Sudoku, WebQSP, MTOP and KVRET through controlled experiments and empirical studies, we find that CASR produces high-quality outputs. CASR also improves Accuracy on Sudoku (70.93% --> 97.28%) and achieves state-of-the-art performance on KVRET with Micro F1 score (67.88% --> 70.00%).}

  abstract     = {Recently, transformers have shown strong ability as visual feature extractors, surpassing traditional convolution-based models in various scenarios. However, the success of vision transformers largely owes to their capacity to accommodate numerous parameters. As a result, new challenges for adapting a well-trained transformer to downstream tasks arise. On the one hand, classic fine-tuning tunes all parameters in a huge model for every downstream task and thus easily falls into an overfitting situation, leading to inferior performance. On the other hand, on resource-limited devices, fine-tuning stores a full copy of all parameters and thus is usually impracticable for the shortage of storage space. However, few works have focused on how to efficiently and effectively transfer knowledge in a vision transformer. Existing methods did not dive into the properties of visual features, leading to inferior performance. Moreover, some of them bring heavy inference cost though benefiting storage. To tackle these problems, we propose consolidator to achieve efficient transfer learning for large vision models. Our consolidator modifies the pre-trained model with the addition of a small set of tunable parameters to temporarily store the task-specific knowledge while freezing the backbone model during adaptation. Motivated by the success of group-wise convolution, we adopt grouped connections across the features extracted by fully connected layers to construct tunable parts in a consolidator. To further enhance the model's capacity to transfer knowledge under a constrained storage budget and keep inference efficient, we consolidate the parameters in two stages: 1. between adaptation and storage, and 2. between loading and inference. On a series of downstream visual tasks, our consolidator can reach up to 7.56 better accuracy than full fine-tuning with merely 0.35% parameters, and outperform state-of-the-art parameter-efficient tuning methods by a clear margin.}

Previous theoretical works study the role of pretraining losses, and view neural networks as general black boxes. However, the recent work of [Saunshi et al.] argues that the model architecture --- a component largely ignored by previous works --- also has significant influences on the downstream performance of self-supervised learning. In this work, we provide the first theoretical analysis of self-supervised learning that incorporates the effect of inductive biases originating from the model class. In particular, we focus on contrastive learning --- a popular self-supervised learning method that is widely used in the vision domain. We show that when the model has limited capacity, contrastive representations would recover certain special clustering structures that are compatible with the model architecture, but ignore many other clustering structures in the data distribution. As a result, our theory can capture the more realistic setting where contrastive representations have much lower dimensionality than the number of clusters in the data distribution. We instantiate our theory on several synthetic data distributions, and provide empirical evidence to support the theory.}

  abstract     = {Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted great attention due to their distinctive characteristics of low power consumption and temporal information processing. ANN-SNN conversion, as the most commonly used training method for applying SNNs, can ensure that converted SNNs achieve comparable performance to ANNs on large-scale datasets. However, the performance degrades severely under low quantities of time-steps, which hampers the practical applications of SNNs to neuromorphic chips. In this paper, instead of evaluating different conversion errors and then eliminating these errors, we define an offset spike to measure the degree of deviation between actual and desired SNN firing rates. We perform a detailed analysis of offset spike and note that the firing of one additional (or one less) spike is the main cause of conversion errors. Based on this, we propose an optimization strategy based on shifting the initial membrane potential and we theoretically prove the corresponding optimal shifting distance for calibrating the spike. In addition, we also note that our method has a unique iterative property that enables further reduction of conversion errors. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets. For example, we reach a top-1 accuracy of 67.12% on ImageNet when using 6 time-steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an ANN-SNN conversion has been shown to simultaneously achieve high accuracy and ultralow latency on complex datasets.}

  abstract     = {The state space in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) grows exponentially with the agent number. Such a curse of dimensionality results in poor scalability and low sample efficiency, inhibiting MARL for decades. To break this curse, we propose a unified agent permutation framework that exploits the permutation invariance (PI) and permutation equivariance (PE) inductive biases to reduce the multiagent state space. Our insight is that permuting the order of entities in the factored multiagent state space does not change the information. Specifically, we propose two novel implementations: a Dynamic Permutation Network (DPN) and a Hyper Policy Network (HPN). The core idea is to build separate entity-wise PI input and PE output network modules to connect the entity-factored state space and action space in an end-to-end way. DPN achieves such connections by two separate module selection networks, which consistently assign the same input module to the same input entity (guarantee PI) and assign the same output module to the same entity-related output (guarantee PE). To enhance the representation capability, HPN replaces the module selection networks of DPN with hypernetworks to directly generate the corresponding module weights. Extensive experiments in SMAC, Google Research Football and MPE validate that the proposed methods significantly boost the performance and the learning efficiency of existing MARL algorithms. Remarkably, in SMAC, we achieve 100% win rates in almost all hard and super-hard scenarios (never achieved before).}

  abstract     = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) and Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) are two major paradigms of policy optimization with distinct learning principles, i.e., gradient-based v.s. gradient-free. An appealing research direction is integrating Deep RL and EA to devise new methods by fusing their complementary advantages. However, existing works on combining Deep RL and EA have two common drawbacks:1) the RL agent and EA agents learn their policies individually, neglecting efficient sharing of useful common knowledge; 2) parameter-level policy optimization guarantees no semantic level of behavior evolution for the EA side. In this paper, we propose Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning with Two-scale State Representation and Policy Representation (ERL-Re²), a novel solution to the aforementioned two drawbacks. The key idea of ERL-Re² is two-scale representation: all EA and RL policies share the same nonlinear state representation while maintaining individual linear policy representations. The state representation conveys expressive common features of the environment learned by all the agents collectively; the linear policy representation provides a favorable space for efficient policy optimization, where novel behavior-level crossover and mutation operations can be performed. Moreover, the linear policy representation allows convenient generalization of policy fitness with the help of Policy-extended Value Function Approximator (PeVFA), further improving the sample efficiency of fitness estimation. The experiments on a range of continuous control tasks show that ERL-Re² consistently outperforms advanced baselines and achieves the State Of The Art (SOTA).}

However, existing methods are insufficient to handle those PDE constraints that have a complicated or nonlinear dependency on optimization targets. In this paper, we present a novel bi-level optimization framework to resolve the challenge by decoupling the optimization of the targets and constraints. For the inner loop optimization, we adopt PINNs to solve the PDE constraints only. For the outer loop, we design a novel method by using Broyden's method based on the Implicit Function Theorem (IFT), which is efficient and accurate for approximating hypergradients. We further present theoretical explanations and error analysis of the hypergradients computation. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale and nonlinear PDE constrained optimization problems demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results compared with strong baselines.}

  abstract     = {Humans have been shown to use a ''straightened'' encoding to represent the natural visual world as itevolves in time (Henaff et al. 2019). In the context of discrete video sequences, ''straightened'' means that changes between frames follow a more linear path in representation space at progressively deeper levels of processing. While deep convolutional networks are often proposed as models of human visual processing, many do not straighten natural videos. In this paper, we explore the relationship between network architecture, differing types of robustness, biologically-inspired filtering mechanisms, and representational straightness in response to time-varying input; we identify strengths and limitations of straightness as a useful way of evaluating neural network representations. We find that (1) adversarial training leads to straighter representations in both CNN and transformer-based architectures but (2) this effect is task-dependent, not generalizing to tasks such as segmentation and frame-prediction, where straight representations are not favorable for predictions; and nor to other types of robustness. In addition, (3) straighter representations impart temporal stability to class predictions, even for out-of-distribution data. Finally, (4) biologically-inspired elements increase straightness in the early stages of a network, but do not guarantee increased straightness in downstream layers of CNNs. We show that straightness is an easily computed measure of representational robustness and stability, as well as a hallmark of human representations with benefits for computer vision models.}

  abstract     = {In the literature on game-theoretic equilibrium finding, focus has mainly been on solving a single game in isolation. In practice, however, strategic interactions—ranging from routing problems to online advertising auctions—evolve dynamically, thereby leading to many similar games to be solved. To address this gap, we introduce meta-learning for equilibrium finding and learning to play games. We establish the first meta-learning guarantees for a variety of fundamental and well-studied games, including two-player zero-sum games, general-sum games, Stackelberg games, and multiple extensions thereof. In particular, we obtain rates of convergence to different game-theoretic equilibria that depend on natural notions of similarity between the sequence of games encountered, while at the same time recovering the known single-game guarantees when the sequence of games is arbitrary. Along the way, we prove a number of new results in the single-game regime through a simple and unified framework, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we evaluate our meta-learning algorithms on endgames faced by the poker agent Libratus against top human professionals. The experiments show that games with varying stack sizes can be solved significantly faster using our meta-learning techniques than by solving them separately, often by an order of magnitude.}

In order to study the generalization behavior of a distilled student, we propose a new theoretical framework that leverages supervision complexity: a measure of alignment between teacher-provided supervision and the student's neural tangent kernel. The framework highlights a delicate interplay among the teacher's accuracy, the student's margin with respect to the teacher predictions, and the complexity of the teacher predictions. Specifically, it provides a rigorous justification for the utility of various techniques that are prevalent in the context of distillation, such as early stopping and temperature scaling. Our analysis further suggests the use of online distillation, where a student receives increasingly more complex supervision from teachers in different stages of their training. We demonstrate efficacy of online distillation and validate the theoretical findings on a range of image classification benchmarks and model architectures.},

In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structured SSM, such as S4, is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structured state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, improves generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32\% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition dataset, Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78\% accuracy with a 30\% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.},

  abstract     = {Recent works indicate that convolutional neural networks (CNN) need large receptive fields (RF) to compete with visual transformers and their attention mechanism. In CNNs, RFs can simply be enlarged by increasing the convolution kernel sizes. Yet the number of trainable parameters, which scales quadratically with the kernel's size in the 2D case, rapidly becomes prohibitive, and the training is notoriously difficult. This paper presents a new method to increase the RF size without increasing the number of parameters. Dilated Convolution with Learnable Spacings (DCLS) is a novel convolution method based on gradient descent and interpolation that could be seen as an improvement of the well known dilated convolution. DCLS presents a new version of dilated convolution in which the spacings between the non-zero elements, or equivalently their positions, are no longer fixed but learnable via backpropagation thanks to an interpolation technique. In DCLS, the positions of the weights within the convolutional kernel are learned in a gradient-based manner, and the inherent problem of non-differentiability due to the integer nature of the positions in the kernel is solved by taking advantage of an interpolation method.},

The goal of the attacker is to cause the final trained model to predict the attacker's desired target label when a predefined trigger is added to test inputs. Central to these attacks is the trade-off between the success rate of the attack and the number of corrupted training examples injected. We pose this attack as a novel bilevel optimization problem: construct strong poison examples that maximize the attack success rate of the trained model. We use neural tangent kernels to approximate the training dynamics of the model being attacked and automatically learn strong poison examples. We provide a new algorithm based on intuitions from kernel regression that uses neural tangent kernels to design stronger backdoor attacks. We experiment on subclasses of CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with WideResNet-34 and ConvNeXt architectures on periodic and patch trigger attacks and show that NTBA-designed poisoned examples achieve, for example, an attack success rate of 90\% with ten times smaller number of poison examples injected compared to the baseline.},

The coefficient matrices are obtained by local features through a generator rather than spatially shared. Previous works had to require coefficient matrices to be constant and spatially shared for their linearity to ensure PDOs translation equivariance, which could lead to sub-optimal feature learning at each position. We establish a new theory on incorporating more equivariance like rotations for such PDOs, and we efficiently implement the generator with an equivariant multilayer perceptron (EMLP). As such equivariant PDOs are generated by neural networks, we call them Neural ePDOs. In experiments, our method significantly improves previous works with smaller model size in various datasets. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MNIST-rot dataset with only half parameters of the previous best model.},

We then show that fine-tuned models fail to retain such property due to catastrophic forgetting, which impacts the calibration on the downstream classification task. Based on our findings, we evaluate the calibration of several methods that preserve pre-trained features and show that preserving pre-trained features can improve the calibration of fine-tuned language models. Among these methods, we propose to encourage the fine-tuned model to learn generative representations with auxiliary language modeling objectives.},

We explore whether further improvements along the two axes are possible and provide affirmative answers leveraging two instantiations of group-wise clipping. To reduce the compute time overhead of private learning, we show that per-layer clipping, where the gradient of each neural network layer is clipped separately, allows clipping to be performed in conjunction with backpropagation in differentially private optimization. This results in private learning that is as memory-efficient and almost as fast per training update as non-private learning for many workflows of interest. While per-layer clipping with constant thresholds tends to underperform standard flat clipping, per-layer clipping with adaptive thresholds matches or outperforms flat clipping under given training epoch constraints, hence attaining similar or better task performance within less wall time. To explore the limits of scaling (pretrained) models in differentially private deep learning, we privately fine-tune the 175 billion-parameter GPT-3. We bypass scaling challenges associated with clipping gradients that are distributed across multiple devices with per-device clipping that clips the gradient of each model piece separately on its host device. Privately fine-tuning GPT-3 with per-device clipping achieves a task performance at \ensuremath{\epsilon}=1 better than what is attainable by non-privately fine-tuning the largest GPT-2 on a summarization task.},

We answer the question ``is it possible to train deep vanilla transformers?'' in the affirmative by designing several approaches that use combinations of parameter initializations, bias matrices and location-dependent rescaling to achieve faithful signal propagation in vanilla transformers. Our methods address various intricacies specific to signal propagation in transformers, including the interaction with positional encoding and causal masking. In experiments on WikiText-103 and C4, our approaches enable deep transformers without normalization to train at speeds matching their standard counterparts, and deep vanilla transformers to reach the same performance as standard ones after about 5 times more iterations.},

Motivated by concerns stemming from extended communication and potential attacks, one-shot FL limits communication to a single round while attempting to retain performance. However, one-shot FL methods often degrade under high statistical heterogeneity, fail to promote pipeline security, or require an auxiliary public dataset. To address these limitations, we propose two novel data-free one-shot FL methods: FedCVAE-Ens and its extension FedCVAE-KD. Both approaches reframe the local learning task using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to address high statistical heterogeneity. Furthermore, FedCVAE-KD leverages knowledge distillation to compress the ensemble of client decoders into a single decoder. We propose a method that shifts the center of the CVAE prior distribution and experimentally demonstrate that this promotes security, and show how either method can incorporate heterogeneous local models. We confirm the efficacy of the proposed methods over baselines under high statistical heterogeneity using multiple benchmark datasets. In particular, at the highest levels of statistical heterogeneity, both FedCVAE-Ens and FedCVAE-KD typically more than double the accuracy of the baselines.},

  abstract     = {We propose a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) for Transformers by developing a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) regulariser for Transformer embeddings. We formalise such attention-based representations as mixture distributions, and use Bayesian nonparametrics to develop a Nonparametric VIB (NVIB) for them. The variable number of mixture components supported by nonparametrics captures the variable number of vectors supported by attention, and exchangeable distributions from nonparametrics capture the permutation invariance of attention. Our Transformer VAE (NVAE) uses NVIB to regularise the information passing from the Transformer encoder to the Transformer decoder. Evaluations of a NVAE, trained on natural language text, demonstrate that NVIB can regularise the number of mixture components in the induced embedding whilst maintaining generation quality and reconstruction capacity.},

  abstract     = {Recent large-scale text-driven synthesis diffusion models have attracted much attention thanks to their remarkable capabilities of generating highly diverse images that follow given text prompts. Therefore, it is only natural to build upon these synthesis models to provide text-driven image editing capabilities. However, Editing is challenging for these generative models, since an innate property of an editing technique is to preserve some content from the original image, while in the text-based models, even a small modification of the text prompt often leads to a completely different outcome. State-of-the-art methods mitigate this by requiring the users to provide a spatial mask to localize the edit, hence, ignoring the original structure and content within the masked region. In this paper, we pursue an intuitive prompt-to-prompt editing framework, where the edits are controlled by text only. We analyze a text-conditioned model in depth and observe that the cross-attention layers are the key to controlling the relation between the spatial layout of the image to each word in the prompt. With this observation, we propose to control the attention maps along the diffusion process. Our approach enables us to monitor the synthesis process by editing the textual prompt only, paving the way to a myriad of caption-based editing applications such as localized editing by replacing a word, global editing by adding a specification, and even controlling the extent to which a word is reflected in the image. We present our results over diverse images and prompts with different text-to-image models, demonstrating high-quality synthesis and fidelity to the edited prompts.},

  abstract     = {Odor perception in mammals is triggered by interactions between volatile organic compounds and a subset of hundreds of proteins called olfactory receptors (ORs). Molecules activate these receptors in a complex combinatorial coding allowing mammals to discriminate a vast number of chemical stimuli. Recently, ORs have gained attention as new therapeutic targets following the discovery of their involvement in other physiological processes and diseases. To date, predicting molecule-induced activation for ORs is highly challenging since $43\%$ of ORs have no identified active compound. In this work, we combine [CLS] token from protBERT with a molecular graph and propose a tailored GNN architecture incorporating inductive biases from the protein-molecule binding. We abstract the biological process of protein-molecule activation as the injection of a molecule into a protein-specific environment. On a newly gathered dataset of $46$ $700$ OR-molecule pairs, this model outperforms state-of-the-art models on drug-target interaction prediction as well as standard GNN baselines. Moreover, by incorporating non-bonded interactions the model is able to work with mixtures of compounds. Finally, our predictions reveal a similar activation pattern for molecules within a given odor family, which is in agreement with the theory of combinatorial coding in olfaction.},

  abstract     = {Pruning neural networks at initialization (PaI) has received an upsurge of interest due to its end-to-end saving potential. PaI is able to find sparse subnetworks at initialization that can achieve comparable performance to the full networks. These methods can surpass the trivial baseline of random pruning but suffer from a significant performance gap compared to post-training pruning. Previous approaches firmly rely on weights, gradients, and sanity checks as primary signals when conducting PaI analysis. To better understand the underlying mechanism of PaI, we propose to interpret it through the lens of the Ramanujan Graph - a class of expander graphs that are sparse while being highly connected. It is often believed there should be a strong correlation between the Ramanujan graph and PaI since both are about finding sparse and well-connected neural networks. However, the finer-grained link relating highly sparse and connected networks to their relative performance (i.e., ranking of difference sparse structures at the same specific global sparsity) is still missing. We observe that not only the Ramanujan property for sparse networks shows no significant relationship to PaI's relative performance, but maximizing it can also lead to the formation of pseudo-random graphs with no structural meanings. We reveal the underlying cause to be Ramanujan Graph's strong assumption on the upper bound of the largest nontrivial eigenvalue (\mu\hat) of layers belonging to highly sparse networks. We hence propose Iterative Mean Difference of Bound (IMDB) as a mean to relax the \mu\hat upper bound. Likewise, we also show there exists a lower bound for \mu\hat, which we call the Normalized Random Coefficient (NaRC), that gives us an accurate assessment for when sparse but highly connected structure degenerates into naive randomness. Finally, we systematically analyze the behavior of various PaI methods and demonstrate the utility of our proposed metrics in characterizing PaI.},

To address the curse of dimensionality, we employ a novel safety critic using the stochastic latent actor-critic (SLAC) approach. The latent variable model predicts rewards and safety violations, and we use the safety critic to train safe policies. Using well-known benchmark environments, we demonstrate competitive performance over existing approaches regarding computational requirements, final reward return, and satisfying the safety constraints.},

However, the problem is highly challenging because closed-form equations lie in a complex combinatorial search space. Existing methods, ranging from heuristic search to reinforcement learning, fail to scale with the number of input variables. We make the observation that closed-form equations often have structural characteristics and invariances (e.g. the commutative law) that could be further exploited to build more effective symbolic regression solutions. Motivated by this observation, our key contribution is to leverage pre-trained deep generative models to capture the intrinsic regularities of equations, thereby providing a solid foundation for subsequent optimization steps. We show that our novel formalism unifies several prominent approaches of symbolic regression and offers a new perspective to justify and improve on the previous ad hoc designs, such as the usage of cross-entropy loss during pre-training. Specifically, we propose an instantiation of our framework, Deep Generative Symbolic Regression (DGSR). In our experiments, we show that DGSR achieves a higher recovery rate of true equations in the setting of a larger number of input variables, and it is more computationally efficient at inference time than state-of-the-art RL symbolic regression solutions.},

In this work, we propose, EVA3D, an unconditional 3D human generative model learned from 2D image collections only. EVA3D can sample 3D humans with detailed geometry and render high-quality images (up to 512x256) without bells and whistles (e.g. super resolution). At the core of EVA3D is a compositional human NeRF representation, which divides the human body into local parts. Each part is represented by an individual volume. This compositional representation enables: 1) inherent human priors 2) adaptive allocation of network parameters 3) efficient training and rendering. Moreover, to accommodate for the characteristics of sparse 2D human image collections (e.g. imbalanced pose distribution), we propose a pose-guided sampling strategy for better GAN learning. Extensive experiments validate that EVA3D achieves state-of-the-art 3D human generation performance regarding both geometry and texture quality. Notably, EVA3D demonstrates great potential and scalability to 'inverse-graphics' diverse human bodies with a clean framework.},

It follows that the performance of the target policy is strongly related to the performance of the behavior policy and, thus, the trajectory return distribution of the dataset. We show that in mixed datasets consisting of mostly low-return trajectories and minor high-return trajectories, state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms are overly restrained by low-return trajectories and fail to exploit high-performing trajectories to the fullest. To overcome this issue, we show that, in deterministic MDPs with stochastic initial states, the dataset sampling can be re-weighted to induce an artificial dataset whose behavior policy has a higher return. This re-weighted sampling strategy may be combined with any offline RL algorithm. We further analyze that the opportunity for performance improvement over the behavior policy correlates with the positive-sided variance of the returns of the trajectories in the dataset. We empirically show that while CQL, IQL, and TD3+BC achieve only a part of this potential policy improvement, these same algorithms combined with our reweighted sampling strategy fully exploit the dataset. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that, despite its theoretical limitation, the approach may still be efficient in stochastic environments.},

  abstract     = {Inferring reward functions from human behavior is at the center of value alignment – aligning AI objectives with what we, humans, actually want. But doing so relies on models of how humans behave given their objectives. After decades of research in cognitive science, neuroscience, and behavioral economics, obtaining accurate human models remains an open research topic. This begs the question: how accurate do these models need to be in order for the reward inference to be accurate? On the one hand, if small errors in the model can lead to catastrophic error in inference, the entire framework of reward learning seems ill-fated, as we will never have perfect models of human behavior. On the other hand, if as our models improve, we can have a guarantee that reward accuracy also improves, this would show the benefit of more work on the modeling side. We study this question both theoretically and empirically. We do show that it is unfortunately possible to construct small adversarial biases in behavior that lead to arbitrarily large errors in the inferred reward. However, and arguably more importantly, we are also able to identify reasonable assumptions under which the reward inference error can be bounded linearly in the error in the human model. Finally, we verify our theoretical insights in discrete and continuous control tasks with simulated and human data.},

  abstract     = {Offline reinforcement learning (RL) promises the ability to learn effective policies solely using existing, static datasets, without any costly online interaction. To do so, offline RL methods must handle distributional shift between the dataset and the learned policy. The most common approach is to learn conservative, or lower-bound, value functions, which underestimate the return of OOD actions. However, such methods exhibit one notable drawback: policies optimized on such value functions can only behave according to a fixed, possibly suboptimal, degree of conservatism. This can be alleviated by learning policies for varying degrees of conservatism at training time and devising a method to dynamically choose one of them during evaluation. To do so, the authors propose learning value functions that additionally condition on the degree of conservatism, which they call "confidence-conditioned value functions". They derive a new form of Bellman backup that simultaneously learns Q-values for any degree of confidence with high probability. By conditioning on confidence, their value functions enable adaptive strategies during online evaluation by controlling for confidence level using the history of observations. This approach can be implemented by conditioning the Q-function from existing conservative algorithms on the confidence. They theoretically show that their learned value functions produce conservative estimates of the true value at any desired confidence. Finally, they empirically demonstrate that their algorithm outperforms existing conservative offline RL algorithms on multiple discrete control domains.},

The state-of-the-art adaptations improve out-of-distribution model accuracy via computation-efficient online test-time gradient descents but meanwhile cost about times of memory versus the inference, even if only a small portion of parameters are updated. Such high memory consumption of CTA substantially impedes wide applications of advanced CTA on memory-constrained devices. In this paper, we provide a novel solution, dubbed MECTA, to drastically improve the memory efficiency of gradient-based CTA. Our profiling shows that the major memory overhead comes from the intermediate cache for back-propagation, which scales by the batch size, channel, and layer number. Therefore, we propose to reduce batch sizes, adopt an adaptive normalization layer to maintain stable and accurate predictions, and stop the back-propagation caching heuristically. On the other hand, we prune the networks to reduce the computation and memory overheads in optimization and recover the parameters afterward to avoid forgetting. The proposed MECTA is efficient and can be seamlessly plugged into state-of-the-art CTA algorithms at negligible overhead on computation and memory. On three datasets, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, MECTA improves the accuracy by at least 6% with constrained memory and significantly reduces the memory costs of ResNet50 on ImageNet by at least 70% with comparable accuracy.},

We prove that the first-layer weights in the NN converge to the k-dimensional principal subspace spanned by the vectors u1,...,uk of the true model, when online SGD with weight decay is used for training. This phenomenon has several important consequences when k << d. First, by employing uniform convergence on this smaller subspace, we establish a generalization error bound of O(sqrt(kd/T)) after T iterations of SGD, which is independent of the width of the NN. We further demonstrate that, by recovering the principal direction, SGD-trained ReLU NNs can learn a single-index target of the form y=f(u,x) + ε with a sample complexity linear in d (up to log factors), where f is a monotonic function with at most polynomial growth, and ε is the noise. This is in contrast to the known d^Omega(p) samples required to learn any degree p polynomial in the kernel regime, and shows that SGD-trained NNs can outperform kernel methods.},

  abstract     = {Robustness evaluation against adversarial examples has become increasingly important to unveil the trustworthiness of the prevailing deep models in natural language processing (NLP). However, in contrast to the computer vision domain where the first-order projected gradient descent (PGD) is used as the benchmark approach to generate adversarial examples for robustness evaluation, there lacks a principled first-order gradient-based robustness evaluation framework in NLP. The emerging optimization challenges lie in 1) the discrete nature of textual inputs together with the strong coupling between the perturbation location and the actual content, and 2) the additional constraint that the perturbed text should be fluent and achieve a low perplexity under a language model. These challenges make the development of PGD-like NLP attacks difficult. To bridge the gap, we propose TextGrad, a new attackGenerator using gradient-driven optimization, supporting high-accuracy and high-quality assessment of adversarial robustness in NLP. Specifically, we address the aforementioned challenges in a unified optimization framework. And we develop an effective convex relaxation method to co-optimize the continuously-relaxed site selection and perturbation variables and leverage an effective sampling method to establish an accurate mapping from the continuous optimization variables to the discrete textual perturbations. Moreover, as a first-order attack generation method, TextGrad can be baked into adversarial training to further improve the robustness of NLP models. Extensive experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of TextGrad not only in attack generation for robustness evaluation but also in adversarial defense. From the attack perspective, we show that TextGrad achieves remarkable improvements in both the attack success rate and the perplexity score over five state-of-the-art baselines. From the defense perspective, TextGrad-enabled adversarial training yields the most robust NLP model against a wide spectrum of NLP attacks.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) are widely used in logistics, transportation, supply chain, and robotic systems. Recently, data-driven VRP heuristics are proposed to generate real-time VRP solutions with up to 100 nodes. Despite this progress, current heuristics for large-scale VRPs still face three major challenges: 1) Difficulty in generalizing the heuristics learned on small-scale VRPs to large-scale VRPs without retraining; 2) Challenge in generating real-time solutions for large-scale VRPs; 3) Difficulty in embedding global constraints into learned heuristics. We contribute in the three directions: We propose a Two-stage Divide Method (TAM) to generate sub-route sequence rather than node sequence for generalizing the heuristics learned on small-scale VRPs to solve large-scale VRPs in real-time. A two-step reinforcement learning method with new reward and padding techniques is proposed to train our TAM. A global mask function is proposed to keep the global constraints satisfied when dividing a large-scale VRP into several small-scale Traveling Salesman Problems (TSPs). As result, we can solve the small-scale TSPs in parallel quickly. The experiments on synthetic and real-world large-scale VRPs show our method could generalize the learned heuristics trained on datasets of VRP 100 to solve VRPs with over 5000 nodes in real-time while keeping the solution quality better than data-driven heuristics and competitive with traditional heuristics.},

  abstract     = {Content creators compete for user attention. Their reach crucially depends on algorithmic choices made by developers on online platforms. To maximize exposure, many creators adapt strategically, as evidenced by examples like the sprawling search engine optimization industry. This begets competition for the finite user attention pool. We formalize these dynamics in what we call an exposure game, a model of incentives induced by modern algorithms including factorization and (deep) two-tower architectures. We prove that seemingly innocuous algorithmic choices—e.g., non-negative vs. unconstrained factorization—significantly affect the existence and character of ({Nash}) equilibria in exposure games. We proffer use of creator behavior models like ours for an (ex-ante) pre-deployment audit. Such an audit can identify misalignment between desirable and incentivized content, and thus complement post-hoc measures like content filtering and moderation. To this end, we propose tools for numerically finding equilibria in exposure games, and illustrate results of an audit on the {MovieLens} and {LastFM} datasets. Among else, we find that the strategically produced content exhibits strong dependence between algorithmic exploration and content diversity, and between model expressivity and bias towards gender-based user and creator groups.},

This work studies a frequently used method in {NMT}, pseudo-label training ({PLT}), which is common to the related techniques of forward-translation (or self-training) and sequence-level knowledge distillation. While the effect of {PLT} on quality is well-documented, we highlight a lesser-known effect: {PLT} can enhance a model's stability to model updates and input perturbations, a set of properties we call model inertia.

Somehow the feature extractor has been overlooked by recent state-of-the-art methods, which directly use a deep model pretrained on {ImageNet} for feature extraction (without further fine-tuning). Under this background, we think the {FSS} feature extractor deserves exploration and observe the heterogeneity (i.e., the intra-class diversity in the raw images) as a critical challenge hindering the intra-class feature compactness. The heterogeneity has three levels from coarse to fine: 1) Sample-level: the inevitable distribution gap between the support and query images makes them heterogeneous from each other. 2) Region-level: the background in {FSS} actually contains multiple regions with different semantics. 3) Patch-level: some neighboring patches belonging to a same class may appear quite different from each other. Motivated by these observations, we propose a feature extractor with {Multi-level} {Heterogeneity} {Suppressing} ({MuHS}). {MuHS} leverages the attention mechanism in transformer backbone to effectively suppress all these three-level heterogeneity. Concretely, {MuHS} reinforces the attention / interaction between different samples (query and support), different regions and neighboring patches by constructing cross-sample attention, cross-region interaction and a novel masked image segmentation (inspired by the recent masked image modeling), respectively. We empirically show that 1) {MuHS} brings consistent improvement for various {FSS} heads and 2) using a simple linear classification head, {MuHS} sets new states of the art on multiple {FSS} datasets, validating the importance of {FSS} feature learning.},

Despite the empirical success of the sim-to-real transfer, its theoretical foundation is much less understood. In this paper, we study the sim-to-real transfer in continuous domain with partial observations, where the simulated environments and real-world environments are modeled by linear quadratic {Gaussian} ({LQG}) systems. We show that a popular robust adversarial training algorithm is capable of learning a policy from the simulated environment that is competitive to the optimal policy in the real-world environment. To achieve our results, we design a new algorithm for infinite-horizon average-cost {LQG}s and establish a regret bound that depends on the intrinsic complexity of the model class. Our algorithm crucially relies on a novel history clipping scheme, which might be of independent interest.},

In this setting, an agent first interacts with the environment without accessing the reward function in the exploration phase. In the subsequent planning phase, it is given a reward function and asked to output an $\epsilon$-optimal policy. We propose a novel algorithm {LSVI-RFE} under the linear {MDP} setting, where the transition probability and reward functions are linear in a feature mapping. We prove an $\tilde{O}(H^4 d^2/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity upper bound for {LSVI-RFE}, where $H$ is the episode length and $d$ is the feature dimension. We also establish a sample complexity lower bound of $\Omega(H^3 d^2/\epsilon^2)$. To the best of our knowledge, {LSVI-RFE} is the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves the minimax optimal sample complexity in linear {MDP} settings up to an $H$ and logarithmic factors. Our {LSVI-RFE} algorithm is based on a novel variance-aware exploration mechanism to avoid overly-conservative exploration in prior works. Our sharp bound relies on the decoupling of {UCB} bonuses during two phases, and a {Bernstein}-type self-normalized bound, which remove the extra dependency of sample complexity on $H$ and $d$, respectively.},

We propose '{Planning} {Exploratory} {Goals}' ({PEG}), a method that sets goals for each training episode to directly optimize an intrinsic exploration reward. {PEG} first chooses goal commands such that the agent's goal-conditioned policy, at its current level of training, will end up in states with high exploration potential. It then launches an exploration policy starting at those promising states. To enable this direct optimization, {PEG} learns world models and adapts sampling-based planning algorithms to 'plan goal commands'. In challenging simulated robotics environments including a multi-legged ant robot in a maze, and a robot arm on a cluttered tabletop, {PEG} exploration enables more efficient and effective training of goal-conditioned policies relative to baselines and ablations. Our ant successfully navigates a long maze, and the robot arm successfully builds a stack of three blocks upon command.},

Meanwhile, symbolic probabilistic models function with clear interpretability, but how to combine them with neural networks to enhance their performance remains to be explored. In this paper, we try to marry these two systems for text classification via a structured language model. We propose a {Symbolic-Neural} model that can learn to explicitly predict class labels of text spans from a constituency tree without requiring any access to span-level gold labels. As the structured language model learns to predict constituency trees in a self-supervised manner, only raw texts and sentence-level labels are required as training data, which makes it essentially a general constituent-level self-interpretable classification model. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach could achieve good prediction accuracy in downstream tasks. Meanwhile, the predicted span labels are consistent with human rationales to a certain degree.},

This paper provides a theoretical analysis of generalization error of federated learning, which captures both heterogeneity and relatedness of the distributions. In particular, we assume that the heterogeneous distributions are sampled from a meta-distribution. In this two-level distribution framework, we characterize the generalization error not only for clients participating in the training but also for unparticipating clients. We first show that the generalization error for unparticipating clients can be bounded by participating generalization error and participating gap caused by clients' sampling. We further establish fast learning bounds of order $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{mn} + \frac{1}{m})$ for unparticipating clients, where $m$ is the number of clients and $n$ is the sample size at each client. To our knowledge, the obtained fast bounds are state-of-the-art in the two-level distribution framework. Moreover, previous theoretical results mostly require the loss function to be bounded. We derive convergence bounds of order $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{mn}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}})$ under unbounded assumptions, including sub-exponential and sub-{Weibull} losses.},

From the perspective of preserving neighboring information, {SSCL} can be viewed as a special case of {SNE} with the input space pairwise similarities specified by data augmentation. The established correspondence facilitates deeper theoretical understanding of learned features of {SSCL}, as well as methodological guidelines for practical improvement. Specifically, through the lens of {SNE}, we provide novel analysis on domain-agnostic augmentations, implicit bias and robustness of learned features. To illustrate the practical advantage, we demonstrate that the modifications from {SNE} to $t$-{SNE} can also be adopted in the {SSCL} setting, achieving significant improvement in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization.},

One crucial stepping stone is to devise {RL} algorithms that are robust in the face of dropped information from corrupted communication or malfunctioning sensors. Typical {RL} methods usually require considerable online interaction data that are costly and unsafe to collect in the real world. Furthermore, when applying to the frame dropping scenarios, they perform unsatisfactorily even with moderate drop rates. To address these issues, we propose {Decision} {Transformer} under {Random} {Frame} {Dropping} ({DeFog}), an offline {RL} algorithm that enables agents to act robustly in frame dropping scenarios without online interaction. {DeFog} first randomly masks out data in the offline datasets and explicitly adds the time span of frame dropping as inputs. After that, a finetuning stage on the same offline dataset with a higher mask rate would further boost the performance. Empirical results show that {DeFog} outperforms strong baselines under severe frame drop rates like 90\%, while maintaining similar returns under non-frame-dropping conditions in the regular {MuJoCo} control benchmarks and the {Atari} environments. Our approach offers a robust and deployable solution for controlling agents in real-world environments with limited or unreliable data.},

While sensory representations have been extensively studied, the representations of motor actions are still an area of active exploration. Our work reveals that a space containing meaningful action representations emerges when a multi-task policy network takes as inputs both states and task embeddings. Moderate constraints are added to improve its representation ability. Therefore, interpolated or composed embeddings can function as a high-level interface within this space, providing instructions to the agent for executing meaningful action sequences. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed action representations are effective for intra-action interpolation and inter-action composition with limited or no additional learning. Furthermore, our approach exhibits superior task adaptation ability compared to strong baselines in Mujoco locomotion tasks. Our work sheds light on the promising direction of learning action representations for efficient, adaptable, and composable RL, forming the basis of abstract action planning and the understanding of motor signal space.},

In RandSAC, we group patch representations (image tokens) into hierarchically arranged segments; within each segment, tokens are predicted in parallel, similar to BERT, while across segment predictions are sequential, similar to GPT. We illustrate that randomized serialization of the segments significantly improves the performance and results in distribution over spatially-long (across-segments) and -short (within-segment) predictions which are effective for feature learning. We validate RandSAC on datasets including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet with vanilla Transformer architecture and demonstrate improved feature learning performance.},

This is because RGB-based models primarily rely on appearance similarity to detect novel objects and are also prone to overfitting short-cut cues such as textures and discriminative parts. To address these shortcomings of RGB-based object detectors, we propose incorporating geometric cues such as depth and normals, predicted by general-purpose monocular estimators. Specifically, we use the geometric cues to train an object proposal network for pseudo-labeling unannotated novel objects in the training set. Our resulting Geometry-guided Open-world Object Detector (GOOD) significantly improves detection recall for novel object categories and already performs well with only a few training classes. Using a single ``person'' class for training on the COCO dataset, GOOD surpasses SOTA methods by 5.0% AR@100, a relative improvement of 24%.},

We focus on the $\epsilon$-coreset for robust clustering, a small proxy of the dataset that preserves the clustering cost within $\epsilon$-relative error for all center sets. Our main result is an $\epsilon$-coreset of size $O(m + \mathrm{poly}(k \epsilon^{-1}))$ that can be constructed in near-linear time. This significantly improves previous results, which either suffers an exponential dependence on $(m + k)$ [Feldman and Schulman, SODA'12], or has a weaker bi-criteria guarantee [Huang et al., FOCS'18]. Furthermore, we show this dependence in $m$ is nearly-optimal, and the fact that it is isolated from other factors may be crucial for dealing with large number of outliers.},

  abstract     = {Direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) with discrete units leverages recent progress in speech representation learning. Specifically, a sequence of discrete representations derived in a self-supervised manner are predicted from the model and passed to a vocoder for speech reconstruction, while still facing the following challenges: 1) Acoustic multimodality: the discrete units derived from speech with same content could be indeterministic due to the acoustic property (e.g., rhythm, pitch, and energy), which causes deterioration of translation accuracy; 2) high latency: current S2ST systems utilize autoregressive models which predict each unit conditioned on the sequence previously generated, failing to take full advantage of parallelism. To tackle these challenges, we propose TranSpeech, a speech-to-speech translation model with bilateral perturbation. The key idea is to impose perturbations on both the input and target sides to alleviate the acoustic multimodality issue and enable parallel decoding.},

The idea is to extract the 'minimal essence' from an input image responsible for the model's prediction. CD optimizes an input mask to extract a small pattern from the input image that can lead to the same model output (i.e., logits or deep features). We find that CD can successfully distill backdoor patterns planted in the trained models, and can distinguish backdoor samples from clean samples. Extensive experiments across different datasets, network architectures, attack and defense methods demonstrate the effectiveness of CD.},

  abstract     = {Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a widely used class of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The limited representational power of MPNNs inspires the study of provably powerful GNN architectures. However, knowing one model is more powerful than another gives little insight about what functions they can or cannot express. It is still unclear whether these models are able to approximate specific functions such as counting certain graph substructures, which is essential for applications in biology, chemistry and social network analysis. Motivated by this, we propose to study the counting power of Subgraph MPNNs, a recent and popular class of powerful GNN models that extract rooted subgraphs for each node, assign the root node a unique identifier and encode the root node's representation within its rooted subgraph. Specifically, we prove that Subgraph MPNNs fail to count more-than-4-cycles at node level, implying that node representations cannot correctly encode the surrounding substructures like ring systems with more than four atoms. To overcome this limitation, we propose I²-GNNs to extend Subgraph MPNNs by assigning different identifiers for the root node and its neighbors in each subgraph. I²-GNNs' discriminative power is shown to be strictly stronger than Subgraph MPNNs and partially stronger than the 3-WL test. More importantly, I²-GNNs are proven capable of counting all 3, 4, 5 and 6-cycles, covering common substructures like benzene rings in organic chemistry, while still keeping linear complexity.},

  abstract     = {Large Transformer-based Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) dominate almost all Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Nevertheless, they still make mistakes from time to time. For a model deployed in an industrial environment, fixing these mistakes quickly and robustly is vital to improve user experiences. Previous works formalize such problems as Model Editing (ME) and mostly focus on fixing one mistake. However, the one-mistake-fixing scenario is not an accurate abstraction of the real-world challenge. In the deployment of AI services, there are ever-emerging mistakes, and the same mistake may recur if not corrected in time. Thus a preferable solution is to rectify the mistakes as soon as they appear nonstop. Therefore, the authors extend the existing ME into the Sequential Model Editing (SME) to help develop more practical editing methods. Their study shows that current ME methods either fail to make a sequence of edits or to remember previous edits. They introduce Transformer-Patcher, a novel model editor that can shift the behavior of transformer-based models by simply adding and training a few neurons in the last Feed-Forward Network layer. Experimental results on both classification and generation tasks show that Transformer-Patcher can: Successively correct up to thousands of errors (Reliability), Generalize to equivalent inputs (Generality), Retain the model's accuracy on irrelevant inputs (Locality). The method outperforms previous fine-tuning and HyperNetwork-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance for Sequential Model Editing (SME).},

The paper identifies that current methods lack a comprehensive understanding of OOD data types, distinguishing between: Benign OOD data (can be adapted to enhance learning performance) and Malign OOD data (severely degrades classification results). The proposed HOOD method aims to leverage the content and style from each image instance to identify benign and malign OOD data. Key innovations include: A variational inference framework to causally disentangle content and style features using a structural causal model, and An intervention process to augment content and style, producing: Benign OOD data (novel styles with preserved content, helping train a style-invariant model) and Malign OOD data (unknown contents with familiar styles, improving robustness against deceiving anomalies). The method is empirically validated across three OOD applications: OOD detection, Open-set semi-supervised learning, and Open-set domain adaptation. The goal is to effectively handle OOD examples in unknown and open environments through novel disentanglement and data augmentation techniques.},

The method enables graph contrastive learning across multiple context scales and can be seamlessly integrated into existing GCNs. The authors demonstrated this by combining SkeletonGCL with three different GCNs (2S-ACGN, CTR-GCN, and InfoGCN), achieving consistent performance improvements on benchmark datasets like NTU60, NTU120, and NW-UCLA. The core innovation is moving beyond local intra-sequence context to explore global cross-sequence relations in skeleton-based action recognition.},

The LTH claims the existence of a winning ticket that can achieve competitive performance to the original dense network. A method called UGS simultaneously prunes graph adjacency matrices and model weights, but the authors find that their sparsifications lead to different performance characteristics. The key observation is that the performance of a sparsified GNN degrades significantly when the graph sparsity goes beyond a certain extent. The proposed solutions include: adding an auxiliary loss head to better guide edge pruning, and formulating pruning as a min-max optimization problem to gain the robustness of lottery tickets. The authors investigate whether the retrainable winning ticket of a GNN can be effective for graph transfer learning, which they term the transferable graph lottery ticket (GLT) hypothesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed sparsification method and empirically verify the GLT hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {Animals thrive in a constantly changing environment and leverage the temporal structure to learn well-factorized causal representations. In contrast, traditional neural networks suffer from forgetting in changing environments and many methods have been proposed to limit forgetting with different trade-offs. Inspired by the brain thalamocortical circuit, we introduce a simple algorithm that uses optimization at inference time to generate internal representations of the current task dynamically. The algorithm alternates between updating the model weights and a latent task embedding, allowing the agent to parse the stream of temporal experience into discrete events and organize learning about them. On a continual learning benchmark, it achieves competitive end average accuracy by mitigating forgetting, but importantly, the interaction between the weights dynamics and the latent dynamics organizes knowledge into flexible structures with a cognitive interface to control them. Tasks later in the sequence can be solved through knowledge transfer as they become reachable within the well-factorized latent space. The algorithm meets many of the desiderata of an ideal continually learning agent in open-ended environments, and its simplicity suggests fundamental computations in circuits with abundant feedback control loops such as the thalamocortical circuits in the brain.},

However, the existing MORL methods either rely on multiple passes of explicit search for finding the Pareto front and therefore are not sample-efficient, or utilizes a shared policy network for coarse knowledge sharing among policies. To boost the sample efficiency of MORL, we propose Q-Pensieve, a policy improvement scheme that stores a collection of Q-snapshots to jointly determine the policy update direction and thereby enables data sharing at the policy level. We show that Q-Pensieve can be naturally integrated with soft policy iteration with convergence guarantee. To substantiate this concept, we propose the technique of Q replay buffer, which stores the learned Q-networks from the past iterations, and arrive at a practical actor-critic implementation. Through extensive experiments and an ablation study, we demonstrate that with much fewer samples, the proposed algorithm can outperform the benchmark MORL methods on a variety of MORL benchmark tasks.},

  abstract     = {In many scenarios, decision-makers must commit to long-term actions until their resolution before receiving the payoff of said actions, and usually, staying committed to such actions incurs continual costs. For instance, in healthcare, a newly-discovered treatment cannot be marketed to patients until a clinical trial is conducted, which both requires time and is also costly. The paper addresses a critical decision-making challenge: when should decision-makers abandon long-term commitments that are costly and potentially unproductive. The core research question is: When should a decision-maker break a commitment that is likely to fail—either to make an alternative commitment or to make no further commitments at all? Key research contributions include: formulating a new optimal commitment problem (OCP) as a type of optimal stopping/switching problem, theoretical analysis of OCP, developing a practical algorithm to solve the problem, and empirical evaluation using clinical trials with subpopulation selection. The research is particularly relevant to domains with high-stakes, resource-intensive processes like medical research, where strategic decision-making about continuing or abandoning commitments can have significant implications.},

These methods are often heuristics with poor theoretical justifications, and require iterative manual tuning. The paper addresses the challenge of training neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) on long trajectories by proposing a novel multiple shooting technique. The proposed solution uses a principled multiple shooting approach that: splits trajectories into manageable short segments, optimizes segments in parallel, and ensures probabilistic control on continuity over consecutive segments. Technical innovations include variational inference for shooting-based latent neural ODE models, amortized encodings using a transformer-based recognition network, temporal attention and relative positional encoding. The approach aims to provide a more theoretically grounded and systematically optimized method for training neural ODEs across complex, long-duration trajectories, leading to efficient and stable training and state-of-the-art performance on multiple large-scale benchmark datasets.},

In this work, we identify a particular failure mode of OoD generalization for discriminative classifiers that is based on test data (from a new domain) lying in the nullspace of features learnt from source data. The paper investigates a specific out-of-distribution generalization failure mode in discriminative classifiers. The failure mechanism occurs when test data from a new domain can lie in the nullspace of features learnt from source data. Key findings include studies on datasets such as RotatedMNIST, PACS, TerraIncognita, DomainNet, and ImageNet-R. The key insight is that projecting intermediate representations onto the span of directions that obtain maximum training accuracy provides consistent improvements in OoD performance. Additionally, the nullspace behavior also provides insights into neural networks trained on poisoned data. The authors hope their work will galvanize interest in the relationship between the nullspace occupancy failure mode and generalization. The research aims to understand and potentially mitigate out-of-distribution generalization challenges in machine learning models by examining how feature spaces and nullspaces impact model performance.},

However, even today's best models can fail to recognize an object when its pose, lighting, or background varies. While existing benchmarks surface examples challenging for models, they do not explain why such mistakes arise. To address this need, we introduce ImageNet-X—a set of sixteen human annotations of factors such as pose, background, or lighting the entire ImageNet-1k validation set as well as a random subset of 12k training images. Equipped with ImageNet-X, we investigate 2,200 current recognition models and study the types of mistakes as a function of model's (1) architecture, e.g. transformer vs. convolutional, (2) learning paradigm, e.g. supervised vs. self-supervised, and (3) training procedures, e.g., data augmentation. Regardless of these choices, we find models have consistent failure modes across ImageNet-X categories. We also find that while data augmentation can improve robustness to certain factors, they induce spill-over effects to other factors. For example, color-jitter augmentation improves robustness to color and brightness, but surprisingly hurts robustness to pose. Together, these insights suggest to advance the robustness of modern vision models, future research should focus on collecting additional data and understanding data augmentation schemes. Along with these insights, we release a toolkit based on ImageNet-X to spur further study into the mistakes image recognition systems make.},

In this work, we propose a new paradigm for steering the behavior of neural networks, centered around task vectors. A task vector specifies a direction in the weight space of a pre-trained model, such that movement in that direction improves performance on the task. We build task vectors by subtracting the weights of a pre-trained model from the weights of the same model after fine-tuning on a task. We show that these task vectors can be modified and combined together through arithmetic operations such as negation and addition, and the behavior of the resulting model is steered accordingly. Moreover, task vectors can be added together to improve performance on multiple tasks at once. Finally, when tasks are linked by an analogy relationship of the form 'A is to B as C is to D', combining task vectors from three of the tasks can improve performance on the fourth, even when no data from the fourth task is used for training.},

However, the weight generation steps are typically not visually interpretable by humans, because the contents stored in the WM of an NN are not. Here we apply the same principle to generate natural images. The resulting fast weight painters (FPAs) learn to execute sequences of delta learning rules to sequentially generate images as sums of outer products of self-invented keys and values, one rank at a time, as if each image was a WM of an NN. We train our FPAs in the generative adversarial networks framework, and evaluate on various image datasets. We show how these generic learning rules can generate images with respectable visual quality without any explicit inductive bias for images. While the performance largely lags behind the one of specialised state-of-the-art image generators, our approach allows for visualising how synaptic learning rules iteratively produce complex connection patterns, yielding human-interpretable meaningful images. Finally, we also show that an additional convolutional U-Net (now popular in diffusion models) at the output of an FPA can learn one-step 'denoising' of FPA-generated images to enhance their quality. Our code is public.},

  abstract     = {One main challenge in federated learning is the large communication cost of exchanging weight updates from clients to the server at each round. While prior work has made great progress in compressing the weight updates through gradient compression methods, we propose a radically different approach that does not update the weights at all. Instead, our method freezes the weights at their initial random values and learns how to sparsify the random network for the best performance. To this end, the clients collaborate in training a stochastic binary mask to find the optimal sparse random network within the original one. At the end of the training, the final model is a sparse network with random weights -- or a subnetwork inside the dense random network. We show improvements in accuracy, communication (less than $1$ bit per parameter (bpp)), convergence speed, and final model size (less than $1$ bpp) over relevant baselines on MNIST, EMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, in the low bitrate regime.},

We then inquire under which conditions the global minima of the loss recover the 'true' rank of the data: we show that for too large depths the global minimum will be approximately rank 1 (underestimating the rank); we then argue that there is a range of depths which grows with the number of datapoints where the true rank is recovered. Finally, we discuss the effect of the rank of a classifier on the topology of the resulting class boundaries and show that autoencoders with optimal nonlinear rank are naturally denoising.},

  abstract     = {In many retrieval systems the original high dimensional data (e.g., images) is mapped to a lower dimensional feature through a learned embedding model. The task of retrieving the most similar data from a gallery set to a given query data is performed through similarity comparison on features. When the embedding model is updated, it might produce features that are not comparable/compatible with features already in the gallery computed with the old model. Subsequently, all features in the gallery need to be re-computed using the new embedding model -- a computationally expensive process called backfilling. Recently, compatible representation learning methods have been proposed to avoid back-filling. Despite their relative success, there is an inherent trade-off between new model performance and its compatibility with the old model. In this work, we introduce FastFill: a compatible model update process using feature alignment and policy based partial backfilling to promptly elevate retrieval performance. We show that previous backfilling strategies suffer from decreased performance and demonstrate the importance of both the training objective and the ordering in online partial backfilling. We propose a new training method for feature alignment between old and new embedding models using uncertainty estimation. Compared to previous works, we obtain significantly improved backfilling results on a variety of datasets: mAP on ImageNet (+4.4%), Places-365 (+2.7%), and VGG-Face2 (+1.3%). Further, we demonstrate that when updating a biased model with FastFill, the minority subgroup accuracy gap promptly vanishes with a small fraction of partial backfilling.},

  abstract     = {Reliable application of machine learning-based decision systems in the wild is one of the major challenges currently investigated by the field. A large portion of established approaches aims to detect erroneous predictions by means of assigning confidence scores. This confidence may be obtained by either quantifying the model's predictive uncertainty, learning explicit scoring functions, or assessing whether the input is in line with the training distribution. Curiously, while these approaches all state to address the same eventual goal of detecting failures of a classifier upon real-world application, they currently constitute largely separated research fields with individual evaluation protocols, which either exclude a substantial part of relevant methods or ignore large parts of relevant failure sources. In this work, we systematically reveal current pitfalls caused by these inconsistencies and derive requirements for a holistic and realistic evaluation of failure detection. To demonstrate the relevance of this unified perspective, we present a large-scale empirical study for the first time enabling benchmarking confidence scoring functions w.r.t all relevant methods and failure sources. The revelation of a simple softmax response baseline as the overall best performing method underlines the drastic shortcomings of current evaluation in the plethora of publicized research on confidence scoring.},

In memorization, models overfit specific training examples and become susceptible to privacy attacks. In forgetting, examples which appeared early in training are forgotten by the end. In this work, we connect these phenomena. We propose a technique to measure to what extent models 'forget' the specifics of training examples, becoming less susceptible to privacy attacks on examples they have not seen recently. We show that, while non-convexity can prevent forgetting from happening in the worst-case, standard image, speech, and language models empirically do forget examples over time. We identify nondeterminism as a potential explanation, showing that deterministically trained models do not forget. Our results suggest that examples seen early when training with extremely large datasets—for instance those examples used to pre-train a model—may observe privacy benefits at the expense of examples seen later.},

Specifically, we harness linear classifiers to identify consistent error patterns, and, in turn, induce a natural representation of these failure modes as directions within the feature space. We demonstrate that this framework allows us to discover and automatically caption challenging subpopulations within the training dataset. Moreover, by combining our framework with off-the-shelf diffusion models, we can generate images that are especially challenging for the analyzed model, and thus can be used to perform synthetic data augmentation that helps remedy the model's failure modes.},

At sufficient resolution, the cryo-EM maps, along with some knowledge about the imaged molecules, allow de novo atomic modelling. Typically, this is done through a laborious manual process. Recent advances in machine learning applications to protein structure prediction show potential for automating this process. Taking inspiration from these techniques, we have built ModelAngelo for automated model building of proteins in cryo-EM maps. ModelAngelo first uses a residual convolutional neural network (CNN) to initialize a graph representation with nodes assigned to individual amino acids of the proteins in the map and edges representing the protein chain. The graph is then refined with a graph neural network (GNN) that combines the cryo-EM data, the amino acid sequence data and prior knowledge about protein geometries. The GNN refines the geometry of the protein chain and classifies the amino acids for each of its nodes. The final graph is post-processed with a hidden Markov model (HMM) search to map each protein chain to entries in a user provided sequence file. Application to 28 test cases shows that ModelAngelo outperforms state-of-the-art and approximates manual building for cryo-EM maps with resolutions better than 3.5 A.},

Most existing TTA methods adapt the trained classifier using the classifier's prediction on the test data as pseudo-label. However, under test-time domain shift, accuracy of the pseudo labels cannot be guaranteed, and thus the TTA methods often encounter performance degradation at the adapted classifier. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel test-time adaptation method, called Test-time Adaptation via Self-Training with nearest neighbor information (TAST), which is composed of the following procedures: (1) adds trainable adaptation modules on top of the trained feature extractor; (2) newly defines a pseudo-label distribution for the test data by using the nearest neighbor information; (3) trains these modules only a few times during test time to match the nearest neighbor-based pseudo label distribution and a prototype. We empirically show that TAST generates better predictions on the test data than the state-of-the-art TTA methods on two standard benchmark tasks, domain generalization (VLCS, PACS, OfficeHome, and TerraIncognita) and image corruption (CIFAR-10/100-C).},

Given the recent surge of interest in machine learning problems involving non-Euclidean data, in this paper we address the regularization of autoencoders on curved spaces. We show that by ignoring the underlying geometry of the data and applying standard vector space regularization techniques, autoencoder performance can be severely degraded, or worse, training can fail to converge. Assuming that both the data space and latent space can be modeled as Riemannian manifolds, we show how to construct regularization terms in a coordinate-invariant way, and develop geometric generalizations of the denoising autoencoder and reconstruction contractive autoencoder such that the essential properties that enable the estimation of the derivative of the log-probability density are preserved. Drawing upon various non-Euclidean data sets, we show that our geometric autoencoder regularization techniques can have important performance advantages over vector-spaced methods while avoiding other breakdowns that can result from failing to account for the underlying geometry.},

However, such a task construction strategy is fundamentally limited due to heavy reliance on the immutable pseudo-labels during meta-learning and the quality of the representations or the generated samples. To overcome the limitations, we propose a simple yet effective unsupervised meta-learning framework, coined Pseudo-supervised Contrast (PsCo), for few-shot classification. We are inspired by the recent self-supervised learning literature; PsCo utilizes a momentum network and a queue of previous batches to improve pseudo-labeling and construct diverse tasks in a progressive manner. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PsCo outperforms existing unsupervised meta-learning methods under various in-domain and cross-domain few-shot classification benchmarks. We also validate that PsCo is easily scalable to a large-scale benchmark, while recent prior-art meta-schemes are not.},

We attempt to go beyond existing work in complexity and introduce a new model, method and benchmark. We propose EAGLE: a large-scale dataset of \textasciitilde{}1.1 million 2D meshes resulting from simulations of unsteady fluid dynamics caused by a moving flow source interacting with nonlinear scene structure of varying geometries, with 600 different scenes of three different types in total. To perform future forecasting of pressure and velocity on the challenging EAGLE dataset, we introduce a new mesh transformer. It leverages node clustering, graph pooling and global attention to learn long-range dependencies between spatially distant data points without needing a large number of iterations, as existing GNN methods do. We show that our transformer outperforms state-of-the-art performance on, both, existing synthetic and real datasets and on EAGLE.

While the compositionality of these architectures is guaranteed by design, the modules specializing is not. Here we theoretically study the ability of network modules to specialize to useful structures in a dataset and achieve systematic generalization. To this end we introduce a minimal space of datasets motivated by practical systematic generalization benchmarks. From this space of datasets we present a mathematical definition of systematicity and study the learning dynamics of linear neural modules when solving components of the task. Our results shed light on the difficulty of module specialization, what is required for modules to successfully specialize, and the necessity of modular architectures to achieve systematicity. Finally, we confirm that the theoretical results in our tractable setting generalize to more complex datasets and non-linear architectures.},

Recent works have shown the strengths and weaknesses of the resulting GNN architectures, respectively, GCNs and GATs. In this work, we aim at exploiting the strengths of both approaches to their full extent. To this end, we first introduce the graph convolutional attention layer (CAT), which relies on convolutions to compute the attention scores. Unfortunately, as in the case of GCNs and GATs, we show that there exists no clear winner between the three---neither theoretically nor in practice---as their performance directly depends on the nature of the data (i.e., of the graph and features). This result brings us to the main contribution of our work, the learnable graph convolutional attention network (L-CAT): a GNN architecture that automatically interpolates between GCN, GAT and CAT in each layer, by adding only two scalar parameters. Our results demonstrate that L-CAT is able to efficiently combine different GNN layers along the network, outperforming competing methods in a wide range of datasets, and resulting in a more robust model that reduces the need of cross-validating.},

In the tabular domain, their efficiency crucially relies on various forms of regularization to prevent overfitting and provide strong generalization performance. Existing regularization techniques include broad modelling decisions such as choice of architecture, loss functions, and optimization methods. In this work, we introduce Tabular Neural Gradient Orthogonalization and Specialization (TANGOS), a novel framework for regularization in the tabular setting built on latent unit attributions. The gradient attribution of an activation with respect to a given input feature suggests how the neuron attends to that feature, and is often employed to interpret the predictions of deep networks. In TANGOS, we take a different approach and incorporate neuron attributions directly into training to encourage orthogonalization and specialization of latent attributions in a fully-connected network. Our regularizer encourages neurons to focus on sparse, non-overlapping input features and results in a set of diverse and specialized latent units. In the tabular domain, we demonstrate that our approach can lead to improved out-of-sample generalization performance, outperforming other popular regularization methods. We provide insight into why our regularizer is effective and demonstrate that TANGOS can be applied jointly with existing methods to achieve even greater generalization performance.},

We consider the problem of learning a unified representation from partial observations, where useful features may be present in only some of the views. We approach this through a probabilistic formalism enabling views to map to representations with different levels of uncertainty in different components; these views can then be integrated with one another through marginalisation over that uncertainty. Our approach, Partial Observation Experts Modelling (POEM), then enables us to meta-learn consistent representations from partial observations. We evaluate our approach on an adaptation of a comprehensive few-shot learning benchmark, Meta-Dataset, and demonstrate the benefits of POEM over other meta-learning methods at representation learning from partial observations. We further demonstrate the utility of POEM by meta-learning to represent an environment from partial views observed by an agent exploring the environment.},

However, it is computationally costly to generate solutions using existing ML schedulers since they adopt the episodic reinforcement learning framework that necessitates multi-round neural network processing. We propose a novel ML scheduler that uses a one-shot neural network encoder to sample node priorities which are converted by list scheduling to the final schedules. Since the one-shot encoder can efficiently sample the priorities in parallel, our algorithm runs significantly faster than existing ML baselines and has comparable run time with the fast traditional heuristics. We empirically show that our algorithm generates better schedules than both non-neural and neural baselines across various real-world and synthetic scheduling tasks.},

However, we observe that forgetting phenomena in CL are not always unfavorable, especially when there is bias (spurious correlation) in training data. We term such type of forgetting benign forgetting, and categorize detrimental forgetting as malignant forgetting. Based on this finding, our objective in this study is twofold: (a) to discourage malignant forgetting by generating previous representations, and (b) encourage benign forgetting by employing contrastive learning in conjunction with feature-level augmentation. Extensive evaluations of biased experimental setups demonstrate that our proposed method, Learning without Prejudices, is effective for continual unbiased learning.},

  abstract     = {Offline reinforcement learning (RL) addresses the problem of learning a performant policy from a fixed batch of data collected by following some behavior policy. Model-based approaches are particularly appealing in the offline setting since they can extract more learning signals from the logged dataset by learning a model of the environment. However, the performance of existing model-based approaches falls short of model-free counterparts, due to the compounding of estimation errors in the learned model. Driven by this observation, we argue that it is critical for a model-based method to understand when to trust the model and when to rely on model-free estimates, and how to act conservatively w.r.t. both. To this end, we derive an elegant and simple methodology called conservative Bayesian model-based value expansion for offline policy optimization (CBOP), that trades off model-free and model-based estimates during the policy evaluation step according to their epistemic uncertainties, and facilitates conservatism by taking a lower bound on the Bayesian posterior value estimate. On the standard D4RL continuous control tasks, we find that our method significantly outperforms previous model-based approaches: e.g., MOPO by $116.4$\%, MOReL by $23.2$\% and COMBO by $23.7$\%. Further, CBOP achieves state-of-the-art performance on $11$ out of $18$ benchmark datasets while doing on par on the remaining datasets.},

  abstract     = {Federated Averaging (FedAvg) remains the most popular algorithm for Federated Learning (FL) optimization due to its simple implementation, stateless nature, and privacy guarantees combined with secure aggregation. Recent work has sought to generalize the vanilla averaging in FedAvg to a generalized gradient descent step by treating client updates as pseudo-gradients and using a server step size. While the use of a server step size has been shown to provide performance improvement theoretically, the practical benefit of the server step size has not been seen in most existing works. In this work, we present FedExP, a method to adaptively determine the server step size in FL based on dynamically varying pseudo-gradients throughout the FL process. We begin by considering the overparameterized convex regime, where we reveal an interesting similarity between FedAvg and the Projection Onto Convex Sets (POCS) algorithm. We then show how FedExP can be motivated as a novel extension to the extrapolation mechanism that is used to speed up POCS. Our theoretical analysis later also discusses the implications of FedExP in underparameterized and non-convex settings. Experimental results show that FedExP consistently converges faster than FedAvg and competing baselines on a range of realistic FL datasets.},

  abstract     = {We consider the off-policy evaluation problem of reinforcement learning using deep convolutional neural networks. We analyze the deep fitted Q-evaluation method for estimating the expected cumulative reward of a target policy, when the data are generated from an unknown behavior policy. We show that, by choosing network size appropriately, one can leverage any low-dimensional manifold structure in the Markov decision process and obtain a sample-efficient estimator without suffering from the curse of high data ambient dimensionality. Specifically, we establish a sharp error bound for fitted Q-evaluation, which depends on the intrinsic dimension of the state-action space, the smoothness of Bellman operator, and a function class-restricted χ²-divergence. It is noteworthy that the restricted χ²-divergence measures the behavior and target policies' mismatch in the function space, which can be small even if the two policies are not close to each other in their tabular forms. We also develop a novel approximation result for convolutional neural networks in Q-function estimation. Numerical experiments are provided to support our theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {The standard paradigm of neural language generation adopts maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) as the optimizing method. From a distributional view, MLE in fact minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the distribution of the real data and that of the model. However, this approach forces the model to distribute non-zero (sometimes large) probability mass to all training samples regardless of their quality. Moreover, in the attempt to cover the low-probability regions in the data distribution, the model systematically overestimates the probability of corrupted text sequences, which we conjecture is one of the main reasons for text degeneration during autoregressive decoding. To remedy this problem, we leverage the total variation distance (TVD) with its robustness to outliers, and develop practical bounds to apply it to language generation. Then, we introduce the TaiLr objective that balances the tradeoff of estimating TVD. Intuitively, TaiLr downweights real data samples that have low model probabilities with tunable penalization intensity. Experimental results show that our method alleviates the overestimation of degenerated sequences without sacrificing diversity and improves generation quality on a wide range of text generation tasks.},

These methods, however, have been exceedingly difficult to train without supervision and are ambiguous in the notion of object, especially for complex natural scenes. In this paper, we propose to address these issues by investigating the potential of learnable queries as initializations for Slot-Attention learning, uniting it with efforts from existing attempts on improving Slot-Attention learning with bi-level optimization. With simple code adjustments on Slot-Attention, our model, Bi-level Optimized Query Slot Attention, achieves state-of-the-art results on 3 challenging synthetic and 7 complex real-world datasets in unsupervised image segmentation and reconstruction, outperforming previous baselines by a large margin.

We first formulate the framework of Multi-Objective Online Convex Optimization, which encompasses a novel multi-objective regret. This regret is built upon a sequence-wise extension of the commonly used discrepancy metric Pareto suboptimality gap in zero-order multi-objective bandits. We then derive an equivalent form of the regret, making it amenable to be optimized via first-order iterative methods. To motivate the algorithm design, we give an explicit example in which equipping OMD with the vanilla min-norm solver for gradient composition will incur a linear regret, which shows that merely regularizing the iterates, as in single-objective online learning, is not enough to guarantee sublinear regrets in the multi-objective setting. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel min-regularized-norm solver that regularizes the composite weights. Combining min-regularized-norm with OMD results in the Doubly Regularized Online Mirror Multiple Descent algorithm. We further derive the multi-objective regret bound for the proposed algorithm, which matches the optimal bound in the single-objective setting. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

We decompose the computational graph of the neural network into the fixed path and float path and investigate their role in generating adversarial examples. Based on our analysis, we categorize the vulnerable examples into Lipschitz vulnerability and float neuron vulnerability. We show that the boost of robust accuracy from randomized smoothing is the result of correcting the latter. We then propose an SC-RFP (smoothed classifier with repressed float path) to further reduce the instability of the float neurons and show that our result can provide a higher certified radius as well as accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Recently, both Contrastive Learning (CL) and Mask Image Modeling (MIM) demonstrate that self-supervision is powerful to learn good representations. However, naively combining them is far from success. In this paper, we start by making the empirical observation that a naive joint optimization of CL and MIM losses leads to conflicting gradient directions - more severe as the layers go deeper. This motivates us to shift the paradigm from combining loss at the end, to choosing the proper learning method per network layer. Inspired by experimental observations, we find that MIM and CL are suitable to lower and higher layers, respectively. We hence propose to combine them in a surprisingly simple, ``sequential cascade'' fashion: early layers are first trained under one MIM loss, on top of which latter layers continue to be trained under another CL loss. The proposed Layer Grafted Pre-training learns good visual representations that demonstrate superior label efficiency in downstream applications, in particular yielding strong few-shot performance besides linear evaluation. For instance, on ImageNet-1k, Layer Grafted Pre-training yields 65.5\% Top-1 accuracy in terms of 1\% few-shot learning with ViT-B/16, which improves MIM and CL baselines by 14.4\% and 2.1\% with no bells and whistles.},

We model the network with a degree-corrected stochastic block model, which allows for severe degree heterogeneity and potentially non-assortative communities. We propose a fast algorithm that computes a 'structural similarity metric' between the new node and each of the K communities, aggregating information in labeled and unlabeled data. The estimated label of the new node is equal to the value of k that maximizes this similarity metric. Our method is computationally fast and compares favorably with existing semi-supervised algorithms on numerical performance. In theory, we derive explicit bounds for the misclassification error and show the efficiency of our method by comparing it with an ideal classifier. To our best knowledge, our results provide the first semi-supervised community detection algorithm with theoretical guarantees.},

We then present the first framework of few-shot forecasting for high-dimensional time-series: instead of learning a single dynamic function, we leverage data of diverse dynamics and learn to adapt latent dynamic functions to few-shot support series.},

In this work, we introduce Draft, Sketch, and Prove ({DSP}), a method that maps informal proofs to formal proof sketches, and uses the sketches to guide an automated prover by directing its search to easier sub-problems. We investigate two relevant setups where informal proofs are either written by humans or generated by a language model. Our experiments and ablation studies show that large language models are able to produce well-structured formal sketches that follow the same reasoning steps as the informal proofs. Guiding an automated prover with these sketches enhances its performance from 20.9\% to 39.3\% on a collection of mathematical competition problems.},

To cope with the vast search space, existing work usually adopts a two-stage approach: it first retrieves a relatively small subgraph related to the question and then performs the reasoning on the subgraph to find the answer entities accurately. Although these two stages are highly related, previous work employs very different technical solutions for developing the retrieval and reasoning models, neglecting their relatedness in task essence. In this paper, we propose {UniKGQA}, a novel approach for multi-hop {KGQA} task, by unifying retrieval and reasoning in both model architecture and parameter learning. For model architecture, {UniKGQA} consists of a semantic matching module based on a pre-trained language model ({PLM}) for question-relation semantic matching, and a matching information propagation module to propagate the matching information along the directed edges on {KGs}. For parameter learning, we design a shared pre-training task based on question-relation matching for both retrieval and reasoning models, and then propose retrieval- and reasoning-oriented fine-tuning strategies. Compared with previous studies, our approach is more unified, tightly relating the retrieval and reasoning stages. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method on the multi-hop {KGQA} task.},

Synchronous distributed bilevel optimization algorithms, on the other hand, often face the straggler problem and will immediately stop working if a few workers fail to respond. As a remedy, we propose Asynchronous Distributed Bilevel Optimization ({ADBO}) algorithm. The proposed {ADBO} can tackle bilevel optimization problems with both nonconvex upper-level and lower-level objective functions, and its convergence is theoretically guaranteed. Furthermore, it is revealed through theoretic analysis that the iteration complexity of {ADBO} to obtain the $\epsilon$-stationary point is upper bounded by $O(1/\epsilon^2)$. Thorough empirical studies on public datasets have been conducted to elucidate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed {ADBO}.},

In this paper, we propose {Edgeformers}, a framework built upon graph-enhanced Transformers, to perform edge and node representation learning by modeling texts on edges in a contextualized way. Specifically, in edge representation learning, we inject network information into each Transformer layer when encoding edge texts; in node representation learning, we aggregate edge representations through an attention mechanism within each node's ego-graph. On five public datasets from three different domains, {Edgeformers} consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines in edge classification and link prediction, demonstrating the efficacy in learning edge and node representations, respectively.},

In this paper, we study the problem of merging individual models built on different training data sets to obtain a single model that performs well both across all data set domains and can generalize on out-of-domain data. We propose a dataless knowledge fusion method that merges models in their parameter space, guided by weights that minimize prediction differences between the merged model and the individual models. Over a battery of evaluation settings, we show that the proposed method significantly outperforms baselines such as Fisher-weighted averaging or model ensembling. Further, we find that our method is a promising alternative to multi-task learning that can preserve or sometimes improve over the individual models without access to the training data. Finally, model merging is more efficient than training a multi-task model, thus making it applicable to a wider set of scenarios.},

  abstract     = {How to detect a small community in a large network is an interesting problem, including clique detection as a special case, where a naive degree-based χ²-test was shown to be powerful in the presence of an Erdös-Renyi (ER) background. Using Sinkhorn's theorem, we show that the signal captured by the χ²-test may be a modeling artifact, and it may disappear once we replace the Erdös-Renyi model by a broader network model. We show that the recent SgnQ test is more appropriate for such a setting. The test is optimal in detecting communities with sizes comparable to the whole network, but has never been studied for our setting, which is substantially different and more challenging. Using a degree-corrected block model (DCBM), we establish phase transitions of this testing problem concerning the size of the small community and the edge densities in small and large communities. When the size of the small community is larger than √n, the SgnQ test is optimal for it attains the computational lower bound (CLB), the information lower bound for methods allowing polynomial computation time. When the size of the small community is smaller than √n, we establish the parameter regime where the SgnQ test has full power and make some conjectures of the CLB. We also study the classical information lower bound (LB) and show that there is always a gap between the CLB and LB in our range of interest.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel clustering mechanism based on an incompatibility property between subsets of data that emerges during model training. This mechanism partitions the dataset into subsets that generalize only to themselves, i.e., training on one subset does not improve performance on the other subsets. Leveraging the interaction between the dataset and the training process, our clustering mechanism partitions datasets into clusters that are defined by—and therefore meaningful to—the objective of the training process. We apply our clustering mechanism to defend against data poisoning attacks, in which the attacker injects malicious poisoned data into the training dataset to affect the trained model's output. Our evaluation focuses on backdoor attacks against deep neural networks trained to perform image classification using the GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our results show that (1) these attacks produce poisoned datasets in which the poisoned and clean data are incompatible and (2) our technique successfully identifies (and removes) the poisoned data. In an end-to-end evaluation, our defense reduces the attack success rate to below 1% on 134 out of 165 scenarios, with only a 2% drop in clean accuracy on CIFAR-10 and a negligible drop in clean accuracy on GTSRB.},

We conduct our investigation using standard computer vision architectures trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. First, we observe a general phenomenon in which interpolated deep networks suffer a collapse in the variance of their activations. We demonstrate that an appropriate rescaling of the pre-activations of the interpolated networks ameliorates this problem and significantly reduces the barrier. Second, by combining this with an algorithm for finding permutations based on maximizing correlations between the activations of matched neurons, we are able to reduce the interpolation barrier for a standard ResNet18 trained on CIFAR-10 to 1.5% absolute test error. We explore the interaction between our method and the choice of normalization layer, and demonstrate its robustness across a variety of architectures and training sets.},

  abstract     = {Recent approximations to backpropagation (BP) have mitigated many of BP's computational inefficiencies and incompatibilities with biology, but important limitations still remain. Moreover, the approximations significantly decrease accuracy in benchmarks, suggesting that an entirely different approach may be more fruitful. Here, grounded on recent theory for Hebbian learning in soft winner-take-all networks, we present multilayer SoftHebb, i.e. an algorithm that trains deep neural networks, without any feedback, target, or error signals. As a result, it achieves efficiency by avoiding weight transport, non-local plasticity, time-locking of layer updates, iterative equilibria, and (self-) supervisory or other feedback signals – which were necessary in other approaches. Its increased efficiency and biological compatibility do not trade off accuracy compared to state-of-the-art bio-plausible learning, but rather improve it. With up to five hidden layers and an added linear classifier, accuracies on MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and ImageNet, respectively reach 99.4%, 80.3%, 76.2%, and 27.3%. In conclusion, SoftHebb shows with a radically different approach from BP that Deep Learning over few layers may be plausible in the brain and increases the accuracy of bio-plausible machine learning.},

  abstract     = {Self-supervised learning (SSL) for graph neural networks (GNNs) has attracted increasing attention from the graph machine learning community in recent years, owing to its capability to learn performant node embeddings without costly label information. One weakness of conventional SSL frameworks for GNNs is that they learn through a single philosophy, such as mutual information maximization or generative reconstruction. When applied to various downstream tasks, these frameworks rarely perform equally well for every task, because one philosophy may not span the extensive knowledge required for all tasks. To enhance the task generalization across tasks, as an important first step forward in exploring fundamental graph models, we introduce PARETOGNN, a multi-task SSL framework for node representation learning over graphs. Specifically, PARETOGNN is self-supervised by manifold pretext tasks observing multiple philosophies. To reconcile different philosophies, we explore a multiple-gradient descent algorithm, such that PARETOGNN actively learns from every pretext task while minimizing potential conflicts. We conduct comprehensive experiments over four downstream tasks (i.e., node classification, node clustering, link prediction, and partition prediction), and our proposal achieves the best overall performance across tasks on 11 widely adopted benchmark datasets. Besides, we observe that learning from multiple philosophies enhances not only the task generalization but also the single task performances, demonstrating that PARETOGNN achieves better task generalization via the disjoint yet complementary knowledge learned from different philosophies.},

  abstract     = {Meta-learning has arisen as a successful method for improving training performance by training over many similar tasks, especially with deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the theoretical understanding of when and why overparameterized models such as DNNs can generalize well in meta-learning is still limited. As an initial step towards addressing this challenge, this paper studies the generalization performance of overfitted meta-learning under a linear regression model with Gaussian features. In contrast to a few recent studies along the same line, our framework allows the number of model parameters to be arbitrarily larger than the number of features in the ground truth signal, and hence naturally captures the overparameterized regime in practical deep meta-learning. We show that the overfitted min ℓ₂-norm solution of model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) can be beneficial, which is similar to the recent remarkable findings on "benign overfitting" and "double descent" phenomenon in the classical (single-task) linear regression. However, due to the uniqueness of meta-learning such as task-specific gradient descent inner training and the diversity/fluctuation of the ground-truth signals among training tasks, we find new and interesting properties that do not exist in single-task linear regression. We first provide a high-probability upper bound (under reasonable tightness) on the generalization error, where certain terms decrease when the number of features increases. Our analysis suggests that benign overfitting is more significant and easier to observe when the noise and the diversity/fluctuation of the ground truth of each training task are large. Under this circumstance, we show that the overfitted min ℓ₂-norm solution can achieve an even lower generalization error than the underparameterized solution.},

In particular, transfer learning is presumed to ensure the necessary conditions for linear mode connectivity across training runs. In contrast to existing results from image classification, we find that among text classifiers (trained on MNLI, QQP, and CoLA), some pairs of finetuned models have large barriers of increasing loss on the linear paths between them. On each task, we find distinct clusters of models which are linearly connected on the test loss surface, but are disconnected from models outside the cluster---models that occupy separate basins on the surface. By measuring performance on specially-crafted diagnostic datasets, we find that these clusters correspond to different generalization strategies. For example, on MNLI, one cluster behaves like a bag of words model under domain shift, while another cluster uses syntactic heuristics. Our work demonstrates how the geometry of the loss surface can guide models towards different heuristic functions in standard finetuning settings.},

While there are several principles for active learning, a prevailing approach is to estimate uncertainties of predictions for unlabeled samples and use them to define acquisition functions. Active learning with the uncertainty principle works well for deep learning, especially for large-scale image classification tasks with deep neural networks. Still, it is often overlooked how the uncertainty of predictions is estimated, despite the common findings on the difficulty of accurately estimating uncertainties of deep neural networks. In this paper, we highlight the effectiveness of snapshot ensembles for deep active learning. Compared to the previous approaches based on Monte-Carlo dropout or deep ensembles, we show that a simple acquisition strategy based on uncertainties estimated from parameter snapshots gathered from a single optimization path significantly improves the quality of the acquired samples. Based on this observation, we further propose an efficient active learning algorithm that maintains a single learning trajectory throughout the entire active learning episodes, unlike the existing algorithms training models from scratch for every active learning episode. Through the extensive empirical comparison, we demonstrate the effectiveness of snapshot ensembles for deep active learning.},

  abstract     = {The aim of continual learning is to learn new tasks continuously (i.e., plasticity) without forgetting previously learned knowledge from old tasks (i.e., stability). In the scenario of online continual learning, wherein data comes strictly in a streaming manner, the plasticity of online continual learning is more vulnerable than offline continual learning because the training signal that can be obtained from a single data point is limited. To overcome the stability-plasticity dilemma in online continual learning, we propose an online continual learning framework named multi-scale feature adaptation network (MuFAN) that utilizes a richer context encoding extracted from different levels of a pre-trained network. Additionally, we introduce a novel structure-wise distillation loss and replace the commonly used batch normalization layer with a newly proposed stability-plasticity normalization module to train MuFAN that simultaneously maintains high plasticity and stability. MuFAN outperforms other state-of-the-art continual learning methods on the SVHN, CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CORe50 datasets. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the significance and scalability of each proposed component: 1) multi-scale feature maps from a pre-trained encoder, 2) the structure-wise distillation loss, and 3) the stability-plasticity normalization module in MuFAN.},

Although each of the learning schemes has its own strength in terms of applicability or performance, respectively, it is difficult for any method in the either category to be considered as a gold standard since their successful performances are typically limited to specific cases. To that end, we propose a principled method, dubbed as FairDRO, which unifies the two learning schemes by incorporating a well-justified group fairness metric into the training objective using a classwise distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework. We then develop an iterative optimization algorithm that minimizes the resulting objective by automatically producing the correct re-weights for each group. Our experiments show that FairDRO is scalable and easily adaptable to diverse applications, and consistently achieves the state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets in terms of the accuracy-fairness trade-off, compared to recent strong baselines.},

However, this dependence is undesirable for many use cases, such as setting priorities over different data sources in a data acquisition process and informing pricing mechanisms in a data marketplace. We propose a novel model-agnostic approach to data valuation using a non-conventional, class-wise Wasserstein discrepancy. We develop a proxy for validation performance using class-wise Wasserstein distance between training and validation sets, showing this distance characterizes the upper bound of validation performance under certain Lipschitz conditions. We value individual data based on sensitivity analysis of the class-wise Wasserstein distance, where values can be obtained for free from optimization solver outputs. Our learning-agnostic framework enables significant improvement over state-of-the-art performance while being orders of magnitude faster.},

But the means by which these networks capture complex global statistical structure, apparently without suffering from the curse of dimensionality, remain a mystery. To study this, we incorporate diffusion methods into a multi-scale decomposition, reducing dimensionality by assuming a stationary local Markov model for wavelet coefficients conditioned on coarser-scale coefficients. We use a convolutional neural network with local receptive fields to represent these conditional probability models. We show that denoising, super-resolution, and image synthesis results all demonstrate that these structures can be captured with significantly smaller conditioning neighborhoods than required by a Markov model implemented in the pixel domain. These results suggest that score estimation for large complex images can be reduced to low-dimensional Markov conditional models across scales, alleviating the curse of dimensionality.},

We develop a novel scaffolding scheme where the teacher, in addition to setting a predictive target, also scaffolds the student's prediction by censoring hard-to-learn examples. Scaffolding utilizes the same information as the teacher's soft-max predictions as inputs, and in this sense, our proposal can be viewed as a natural variant of vanilla KD. We show on synthetic examples that censoring hard-examples leads to smoothening the student's loss landscape so that the student encounters fewer local minima. As a result, it has good generalization properties. Against vanilla KD, we achieve improved performance and are comparable to more intrusive techniques that leverage feature matching on benchmark datasets.},

Our framework optimizes over neural architectures and trains edge predictors and routing models so that the overall accuracy remains high while minimizing the overall latency. Training a hybrid learner is difficult since we lack annotations of hard edge-examples. We introduce a novel proxy supervision in this context and show that our method adapts seamlessly and near optimally across different latency regimes.

In this paper, we formulate DG as a sample selection problem where each domain is sampled from a common underlying population through non-random sampling probabilities that correlate with both the features and the outcome. Under this setting, the fundamental iid assumption of the empirical risk minimization (ERM) is violated, so it often performs worse on test domains whose non-random sampling probabilities differ from the domains in the training dataset. We propose a Selection-Guided DG (SGDG) framework to learn the selection probability of each domain and the joint distribution of the outcome and domain selection variables. The proposed SGDG is domain generalizable as it intends to minimize the risk under the population distribution. We theoretically proved that, under certain regular conditions, SGDG can achieve smaller risk than ERM. Furthermore, we present a class of parametric SGDG (HeckmanDG) estimators applicable to continuous, binary, and multinomial outcomes. We also demonstrated its efficacy empirically through simulations and experiments on a set of benchmark datasets comparing with other well-known DG methods.},

However, in light of computational intractability barriers in general-sum games, provable guarantees have been thus far either limited to fully competitive or cooperative scenarios or impose strong assumptions that are difficult to meet in most practical applications. In this work, we depart from those prior results by investigating infinite-horizon adversarial team Markov games, a natural and well-motivated class of games in which a team of identically-interested players---in the absence of any explicit coordination or communication---is competing against an adversarial player. This setting allows for a unifying treatment of zero-sum Markov games and Markov potential games, and serves as a step to model more realistic strategic interactions that feature both competing and cooperative interests. Our main contribution is the first algorithm for computing stationary ε-approximate Nash equilibria in adversarial team Markov games with computational complexity that is polynomial in all the natural parameters of the game, as well as 1/ε. The proposed algorithm is based on performing independent policy gradient steps for each player in the team, in tandem with best responses from the side of the adversary; in turn, the policy for the adversary is then obtained by solving a carefully constructed linear program.},

  abstract     = {Contemporary applications of machine learning raise important and overlooked theoretical questions regarding optimization in two-team games. Formally, two-team zero-sum games are defined as multi-player games where players are split into two competing sets of agents, each experiencing a utility identical to that of their teammates and opposite to that of the opposing team. We focus on the solution concept of Nash equilibria and prove CLS-hardness of computing them in this class of games. To further examine the capabilities of online learning algorithms in games with full-information feedback, we propose a benchmark of a simple---yet nontrivial---family of such games. These games do not enjoy the properties used to prove convergence for relevant algorithms. In particular, we use a dynamical systems perspective to demonstrate that gradient descent-ascent, its optimistic variant, optimistic multiplicative weights update, and extra gradient fail to converge. On a brighter note, we propose a first-order method that leverages control theory techniques and under some conditions enjoys last-iterate local convergence to a Nash equilibrium.},

  abstract     = {We propose EventFormer, an asynchronous spatiotemporal representation learning framework augmented by an associative memory to efficiently perform event-based perception. Event cameras capture the world as streams of events asynchronously, leading to temporally precise spatiotemporal information. However, applying conventional deep learning architectures to event-based learning often requires temporal synchronization and incurs high computational costs. EventFormer addresses this challenge by developing a computationally efficient event-based representation learning framework for asynchronously processing event camera data. Through the integration of associative memory mechanisms, EventFormer can selectively attend to relevant spatiotemporal features while maintaining asynchronous processing capabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that EventFormer achieves 0.5\% and 9\% better accuracy with 30000× and 200× less computation compared to state-of-the-art dense and event-based methods, respectively, on event-based object recognition datasets.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning allows multiple parties to collaboratively train a joint model without having to share any local data. It enables applications of machine learning in settings where data is inherently distributed and undisclosable, such as in the medical domain. Joint training is usually achieved by aggregating local models. When local datasets are small, locally trained models can vary greatly from a globally good model. Bad local models can arbitrarily deteriorate the aggregate model quality, causing federating learning to fail in these settings. We propose a novel approach that avoids this problem by interleaving model aggregation and permutation steps. During a permutation step we redistribute local models across clients through the server, while preserving data privacy, to allow each local model to train on a daisy chain of local datasets. This enables successful training in data-sparse domains. Combined with model aggregation, this approach enables effective learning even if the local datasets are extremely small, while retaining the privacy benefits of federated learning.},

We analytically show that NeAW Hebbian learning relieves the bias in neuron activity, allowing more neurons to attend to the representation of the 3D objects.

Our objective is to learn a sequence of sessions incrementally, where each session only includes a few training instances per class while preserving the knowledge of the previously learned ones. SoftNet jointly learns the model weights and adaptive non-binary soft masks at a base training session in which each mask consists of the major and minor subnetwork; the former aims to minimize catastrophic forgetting during training, and the latter aims to avoid overfitting to a few samples in each new training session. We provide comprehensive empirical validations demonstrating that our SoftNet effectively tackles the few-shot incremental learning problem by surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art baselines over benchmark datasets.},

In this paper, we formulate and analyze the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) induced by soft tree ensembles for arbitrary tree architectures. This kernel leads to the remarkable finding that only the number of leaves at each depth is relevant for the tree architecture in ensemble learning with an infinite number of trees. In other words, if the number of leaves at each depth is fixed, the training behavior in function space and the generalization performance are exactly the same across different tree architectures, even if they are not isomorphic. We also show that the NTK of asymmetric trees like decision lists does not degenerate when they get infinitely deep.},

In this work, we propose a new approach: we measure the performance of a collection of models when evaluated at single input point. Specifically, we study a point's profile: the relationship between models' average performance on the test distribution and their pointwise performance on this individual point. We find that profiles can yield new insights into the structure of both models and data---in and out-of-distribution. For example, we empirically show that real data distributions consist of points with qualitatively different profiles. On one hand, there are ``compatible'' points with strong correlation between the pointwise and average performance. On the other hand, there are points with weak and even negative correlation: cases where improving overall model accuracy actually hurts performance on these inputs. As an application, we use profiles to construct a dataset we call CIFAR-10-NEG: a subset of CINIC-10 such that for standard models, accuracy on CIFAR-10-NEG is negatively correlated with CIFAR-10 accuracy. Illustrating for the first time an OOD dataset that completely inverts ``accuracy-on-the-line'' (Miller et al., 2021).},

Agent57 was the first agent to surpass the human benchmark on all 57 games, but this came at the cost of poor data-efficiency, requiring nearly 80 billion frames of experience to achieve. Taking Agent57 as a starting point, we employ a diverse set of strategies to achieve a 200-fold reduction of experience needed to outperform the human baseline, within our novel agent MEME.

While this allows GNNs to learn features depending on the graph structure, for certain graph topologies it leads to inefficient information propagation and a problem known as oversquashing. This has recently been linked with the curvature and spectral gap of the graph. On the other hand, adding edges to the message-passing graph can lead to increasingly similar node representations and a problem known as oversmoothing. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm that prevents oversquashing by systematically adding edges to the graph based on spectral expansion. We combine this with a relational architecture, which lets the GNN preserve the original graph structure and provably prevents oversmoothing. We find experimentally that our algorithm outperforms existing graph rewiring methods in several graph classification tasks.},

To explain these results, we provide a formal characterization of generalization under multi-attribute shifts using a canonical causal graph. Based on the relationship between spurious attributes and the classification label, we obtain realizations of the canonical causal graph that characterize common distribution shifts and show that each shift entails different independence constraints over observed variables.},

The learned model generalizes to new synthetic graphs, is robust to train-test distribution shifts, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on naturalistic graphs for low sample complexity.},

This paper proposes a novel method to continually DAP-train an LM with a sequence of unlabeled domain corpora to adapt the LM to these domains to improve their end-task performances. The key novelty of our method is a soft-masking mechanism that directly controls the update to the LM. A novel proxy is also proposed to preserve the general knowledge in the original LM. Additionally, it contrasts the representations of the previously learned domain knowledge (including the general knowledge in the pre-trained LM) and the knowledge from the current full network to achieve knowledge integration.},

Our proposed method, dubbed Prototype-Wrapper Network (PW-Net), wraps around any neural agent backbone, and results indicate that it does not worsen performance relative to black-box models.

We propose a simple neural network building block called ChordMixer which can model the attention for long sequences with variable lengths. Each ChordMixer block consists of a position-wise rotation layer without learnable parameters and an element-wise MLP layer. Repeatedly applying such blocks forms an effective network backbone that mixes the input signals towards the learning targets. Experiments on the synthetic adding problem, long document classification, and DNA sequence-based taxonomy classification show that our method substantially outperforms other neural attention models.},

Existing {MLP}-based architectures generate worse samples than the grid-based generators with favorable convolutional inductive biases. Models that focus on generating images at different scales do better, but employ complex architectures not designed for continuous evaluation of images and derivatives. We take a signal-processing perspective and treat continuous image generation as interpolation from samples. Indeed, correctly sampled discrete images contain all information about the low spatial frequencies. The question is then how to extrapolate the spectrum in a data-driven way while meeting the above design criteria. Our answer is {FunkNN}---a new convolutional network which learns how to reconstruct continuous images at arbitrary coordinates and can be applied to any image dataset. Combined with a discrete generative model it becomes a functional generator which can act as a prior in continuous ill-posed inverse problems. We show that {FunkNN} generates high-quality continuous images and exhibits strong out-of-distribution performance thanks to its patch-based design. We further showcase its performance in several stylized inverse problems with exact spatial derivatives.},

  abstract     = {Diffusion models have recently outperformed alternative approaches to model the distribution of natural images, such as {GANs}. Such diffusion models allow for deterministic sampling via the probability flow {ODE}, giving rise to a latent space and an encoder map. While having important practical applications, such as estimation of the likelihood, the theoretical properties of this map are not yet fully understood. In the present work, we partially address this question for the popular case of the {VP SDE} ({DDPM}) approach. The key finding of the paper is that the {DDPM} encoder map coincides with the optimal transport map for common distributions and this claim is supported by extensive numerical experiments using advanced tensor train solver for multidimensional {Fokker-Planck} equation. The authors also provide additional theoretical evidence for the case of multivariate normal distributions.},

  abstract     = {Many recent works on understanding deep learning try to quantify how much individual data instances influence the optimization and generalization of a model. Such attempts reveal characteristics and importance of individual instances, which may provide useful information in diagnosing and improving deep learning. However, most of the existing works on data valuation require actual training of a model, which often demands high-computational cost. In this paper, we provide a training-free data valuation score, called complexity-gap score, which is a data-centric score to quantify the influence of individual instances in generalization of two-layer overparameterized neural networks. The proposed score can quantify irregularity of the instances and measure how much each data instance contributes in the total movement of the network parameters during training. We theoretically analyze and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the complexity-gap score in finding 'irregular or mislabeled' data instances, and also provide applications of the score in analyzing datasets and diagnosing training dynamics.},

To synthesise data that is challenging yet semantics-preserving, they generate {Fourier} amplitude images and combine them with source domain phase images, exploiting the widely believed conjecture from signal processing that amplitude spectra mainly determines image style, while phase data mainly captures image semantics. To synthesise a worst-case domain for adaptation, they train the classifier and the amplitude generator adversarially. By {Bayesian} hypothesis modeling, they express the model hypothesis space effectively as a posterior distribution over classifiers given the source domains, making adversarial {MCD} minimisation feasible.

During finetuning on new classes, the performance on previous classes deteriorates quickly even when only a small fraction of parameters are updated, since the previous knowledge is broadly associated with most of the model parameters in the original parameter space. In this paper, we introduce {WaRP}, the weight space rotation process, which transforms the original parameter space into a new space so that we can push most of the previous knowledge compactly into only a few important parameters. By properly identifying and freezing these key parameters in the new weight space, we can finetune the remaining parameters without affecting the knowledge of previous classes. As a result, {WaRP} provides an additional room for the model to effectively learn new classes in future incremental sessions. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our solution and show the improved performance over the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Even though floating point (FP) numbers have been adopted as a de facto standard data format for deep learning computing, the complexity of FP arithmetic impedes a broader deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Recent works such as quantization have attempted to replace the FP matrix multiplication (MatMul) of DNNs with simple integer MatMul by transforming the datatypes of both weights and activations into integers. Unfortunately, unlike weight values that are static, it is challenging to represent dynamic activations with integers. In this paper, to simultaneously achieve the accuracy of FP activation and the simplicity of integer arithmetic, we present a method for replacing FP arithmetic with integer one without changing FP activations in the storage format while weights are quantized. The proposed method pre-aligns the significands of FP activations just ahead of the MatMul on-the-fly so that the aligned significands (integers) can be used for the computation. Inspired by an observation that conventional FP arithmetic does not produce precise results due to rounding, we demonstrate that our proposed integer arithmetic-based scheme can produce the same level of errors as that of the FP arithmetic in case DNNs use FP activations and quantized weights. Experimental results show that the hardware based on the proposed scheme shows significant improvement over FP arithmetic-based designs in terms of energy efficiency and throughput-per-area while maintaining a similar level of accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Dense prediction tasks are a fundamental class of problems in computer vision. As supervised methods suffer from high pixel-wise labeling cost, a few-shot learning solution that can learn any dense task from a few labeled images is desired. Yet, current few-shot learning methods target a restricted set of tasks such as semantic segmentation, presumably due to challenges in designing a general and unified model that is able to flexibly and efficiently adapt to arbitrary tasks of unseen semantics. We propose Visual Token Matching (VTM), a universal few-shot learner for arbitrary dense prediction tasks. It employs non-parametric matching on patch-level embedded tokens of images and labels that encapsulates all tasks. Also, VTM flexibly adapts to any task with a tiny amount of task-specific parameters that modulate the matching algorithm. We implement VTM as a powerful hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture involving ViT backbones where token matching is performed at multiple feature hierarchies. We experiment VTM on a challenging variant of Taskonomy dataset and observe that it robustly few-shot learns various unseen dense prediction tasks. Surprisingly, it is competitive with fully supervised baselines using only 10 labeled examples of novel tasks ($0.004\%$ of full supervision) and sometimes outperforms using $0.1\%$ of full supervision.},

The state-of-the-art text-guided image-agnostic manipulation method embeds the representation of each channel of StyleGAN independently in the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) space, and provides it in the form of a Dictionary to quickly find out the channel-wise manipulation direction during inference time. However, in this paper we argue that this dictionary which is constructed by controlling single channel individually is limited to accommodate the versatility of text guidance since the collective and interactive relation among multiple channels are not considered. Indeed, we show that it fails to discover a large portion of manipulation directions that can be found by existing methods, which manually manipulates latent space without texts. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel method that learns a Dictionary, whose entry corresponds to the representation of a single channel, by taking into account the manipulation effect coming from the interaction with multiple other channels. We demonstrate that our strategy resolves the inability of previous methods in finding diverse known directions from unsupervised methods and unknown directions from random text while maintaining the real-time inference speed and disentanglement ability.},

Our theory supports memorization both with and without permutation equivariance, utilizing positional encodings in the latter case.

In this paper, we argue that the magnitude of augmentation operations for each frame needs to be changed over time to capture the real-world video's temporal variations. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective video data augmentation framework, DynaAugment. The magnitude of augmentation operations on each frame is changed by an effective mechanism, Fourier Sampling that parameterizes diverse, smooth, and realistic temporal variations with minimal additional hyper-parameters during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various video datasets and tasks: large-scale video recognition, small-scale video recognition, fine-grained video recognition, video action segmentation, video action localization, and video object detection.},

NERDS uses rich augmentation to synthesize image pairs for denoiser training. Experiments show that NERDS can accurately train CNN-based denoisers that outperform previous noise-synthesis-based and self-supervision-based approaches on real datasets.},

Although learning-based segmentation approaches have been extensively studied, a large amount of ground-truth labels are required in supervised methods and confusing background structures make neural networks hard to segment vessels in an unsupervised manner. To address this challenge, we propose a novel diffusion adversarial representation learning (DARL) model that leverages a denoising diffusion probabilistic model with adversarial learning for vessel segmentation. For self-supervised vessel segmentation, DARL learns the background signal using a diffusion module, which lets a generation module effectively provide vessel representations. Our model uses adversarial learning based on switchable spatially-adaptive denormalization to estimate synthetic fake vessel images as well as vessel segmentation masks, which helps the model capture vessel-relevant semantic information. Experimental results on various datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing unsupervised and self-supervised vessel segmentation methods. Once trained, the model generates segmentation masks in a single step and can be applied to general vascular structure segmentation of coronary angiography and retinal images.},

Flatness, which measures the perturbation resilience of pre-trained parameters for loss values, is widely acknowledged as an essential predictor of generalization. However, flatness and generalization bounds can be changed arbitrarily according to parameter scale, and previous studies only partially solved this problem with restrictions. As a more fundamental solution, we propose new PAC-Bayes prior and posterior distributions invariant to scaling transformations by decomposing the scale and connectivity of parameters. We introduce the empirical Connectivity Tangent Kernel (CTK), which has scale-invariance properties and can be considered as a modification of the empirical Neural Tangent Kernel. We demonstrate that our approach allows the resulting generalization bound to describe the generalizability of a broad class of networks with more practical transformations such as weight decay with batch normalization. We also show that scaling issues adversely affect the uncertainty calibration of Laplace approximation and propose a solution using our invariant posterior, providing effective flatness and calibration measures with low complexity.},

NCE employs graph neural network to predict the cost-decrements (i.e., results of CE searches) and utilizes the predicted cost-decrements to guide the selection of sub-tours for swapping, while reducing the search cost to O(n^2). The training approach is straightforward: the learning objective of NCE is to predict the cost-decrement, the training can be simply done in a supervised fashion, whose training samples can be easily collected. To show the effectiveness of NCE, we conduct experiments on min-max flexible multi-depot VRP (min-max FMDVRP) and show that the NCE trained with min-max FMDVRP outperforms the meta-heuristic baselines.

Unlike prior approaches assuming human judgment is based on the Markovian rewards which contribute to the decision equally, we introduce a new preference model based on the weighted sum of non-Markovian rewards. We then design the proposed preference model using a transformer architecture that stacks causal and bidirectional self-attention layers. We demonstrate that Preference Transformer can solve a variety of control tasks using real human preferences, while prior approaches fail to work.

However, the sample-efficiency of such {RL} schemes still remains a challenge, particularly for long-horizon tasks. To address this issue, we present a simple yet effective self-imitation scheme which distills a subgoal-conditioned policy into the target-goal-conditioned policy. Our intuition here is that to reach a target-goal, an agent should pass through a subgoal, so target-goal- and subgoal- conditioned policies should be similar to each other. We also propose a novel scheme of stochastically skipping executed subgoals in a planned path, which further improves performance. Unlike prior methods that only utilize graph-based planning in an execution phase, our method transfers knowledge from a planner along with a graph into policy learning. We empirically show that our method can significantly boost the sample-efficiency of the existing goal-conditioned {RL} methods under various long-horizon control tasks.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning is for training a global model without collecting private local data from clients. As they repeatedly need to upload locally-updated weights or gradients instead, clients require both computation and communication resources enough to participate in learning, but in reality their resources are heterogeneous. To enable resource-constrained clients to train smaller local models, width scaling techniques have been used, which reduces the channels of a global model. Unfortunately, width scaling suffers from heterogeneity of local models when averaging them, leading to a lower accuracy than when simply excluding resource-constrained clients from training. This paper proposes a new approach based on depth scaling called {DepthFL}. {DepthFL} defines local models of different depths by pruning the deepest layers off the global model, and allocates them to clients depending on their available resources. Since many clients do not have enough resources to train deep local models, this would make deep layers partially-trained with insufficient data, unlike shallow layers that are fully trained. {DepthFL} alleviates this problem by mutual self-distillation of knowledge among the classifiers of various depths within a local model. Our experiments show that depth-scaled local models build a global model better than width-scaled ones, and that self-distillation is highly effective in training data-insufficient deep layers.},

Moreover, we show that last layer retraining on large {ImageNet}-trained models can also significantly reduce reliance on background and texture information, improving robustness to covariate shift, after only minutes of training on a single {GPU}.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the pose of objects from a single image is an important but difficult computer vision problem. Methods that predict a single point estimate do not predict the pose of objects with symmetries well and cannot represent uncertainty. Alternatives predict a distribution over orientations in {SO}(3), but training can be computation- and sample-inefficient. We propose a novel mapping of features from the image domain to the 3D rotation manifold using {SO}(3) equivariant layers to output rotation distributions that can be sampled at arbitrary resolution. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on {PASCAL}3D+ dataset and can model complex object symmetries without parameter modifications. The approach provides more flexible pose uncertainty representation and includes code available at https://dmklee.github.io/image2sphere.},

Current methods are only trained on a few hundreds or thousands of images as opposed to the millions of examples deep networks are trained on in other domains. In this work, we study whether major performance gains are expected from scaling up the training set size. We consider image denoising, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and super-resolution and empirically determine the reconstruction quality as a function of training set size, while simultaneously scaling the network size. For all three tasks, we find that an initially steep power-law scaling slows significantly already at moderate training set sizes. Interpolating those scaling laws suggests that even training on millions of images would not significantly improve performance. To understand the expected behavior, we analytically characterize the performance of a linear estimator learned with early stopped gradient descent. The result formalizes the intuition that once the error induced by learning the signal model is small relative to the error floor, more training examples do not improve performance.},

For distributions with large isoperimetric constants, score matching becomes substantially less efficient.

Existing deep-learning-based methods encounter several key issues: 1) incomplete context for Complementarity-Determining Regions ({CDRs}) generation; 2) incapability of capturing the entire {3D} geometry of the input structure; 3) inefficient prediction of the {CDR} sequences in an autoregressive manner. In this paper, we propose Multi-channel Equivariant Attention Network ({MEAN}) to co-design {1D} sequences and {3D} structures of {CDRs}. To be specific, {MEAN} formulates antibody design as a conditional graph translation problem by importing extra components including the target antigen and the light chain of the antibody. Then, {MEAN} resorts to {E}(3)-equivariant message passing along with a proposed attention mechanism to better capture the geometrical correlation between different components. Finally, it outputs both the {1D} sequences and {3D} structure via a multi-round progressive full-shot scheme, which enjoys more efficiency and precision against previous autoregressive approaches. Our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art models in sequence and structure modeling, antigen-binding {CDR} design, and binding affinity optimization. Specifically, the relative improvement to baselines is about 23\% in antigen-binding {CDR} design and 34\% for affinity optimization.},

We generalize the {I-MMSE} relations to exactly relate the data distribution to an optimal denoising regression problem, leading to an elegant refinement of existing diffusion bounds. This new insight leads to several improvements for probability distribution estimation, including a theoretical justification for diffusion model ensembling. Remarkably, our framework shows how continuous and discrete probabilities can be learned with the same regression objective, avoiding domain-specific generative models used in variational methods.},

It leads to a gradient-based optimizer with intrinsically added momentum. This method exactly preserves the manifold structure but does not require additional operation to keep momentum in the changing (co)tangent space, and thus has low computational cost and pleasant accuracy. Its generalization to adaptive learning rates is also demonstrated. Notable performances are observed in practical tasks. For instance, we found that placing orthogonal constraints on attention heads of trained-from-scratch Vision Transformer could markedly improve its performance, when our optimizer is used, and it is better that each head is made orthogonal within itself but not necessarily to other heads. This optimizer also makes the useful notion of Projection Robust Wasserstein Distance for high-dim. optimal transport even more effective.},

  abstract     = {Population dynamics is the study of temporal and spatial variation in the size of populations of organisms and is a major part of population ecology. One of the main difficulties in analyzing population dynamics is that we can only obtain observation data with coarse time intervals from fixed-point observations due to experimental costs or measurement constraints. Recently, modeling population dynamics by using continuous normalizing flows ({CNFs}) and dynamic optimal transport has been proposed to infer the sample trajectories from a fixed-point observed population. While the sample behavior in {CNFs} is deterministic, the actual sample in biological systems moves in an essentially random yet directional manner. Moreover, when a sample moves from point A to point B in dynamical systems, its trajectory typically follows the principle of least action in which the corresponding action has the smallest possible value. To satisfy these requirements of the sample trajectories, we formulate the Lagrangian Schr{\"o}dinger bridge ({LSB}) problem and propose to solve it approximately by modeling the advection-diffusion process with regularized neural {SDE}. We also develop a model architecture that enables faster computation of the loss function. Experimental results show that the proposed method can efficiently approximate the population-level dynamics even for high-dimensional data and that using the prior knowledge introduced by the Lagrangian enables us to estimate the sample-level dynamics with stochastic behavior.},

In this paper, we aim to theoretically understand a semi-supervised learning approach based on pre-training and linear probing. In particular, the semi-supervised learning approach we consider first trains a two-layer neural network based on the unlabeled data with the help of pseudo-labelers. Then it linearly probes the pre-trained network on a small amount of labeled data. We prove that, under a certain toy data generation model and two-layer convolutional neural network, the semisupervised learning approach can achieve nearly zero test loss, while a neural network directly trained by supervised learning on the same amount of labeled data can only achieve constant test loss. Through this case study, we demonstrate a separation between semi-supervised learning and supervised learning in terms of test loss provided the same amount of labeled data.},

Calculating the output of this neural network can be accomplished using $O(\sqrt{n})$ elementary arithmetic operations of additions, multiplications and comparisons for each input.

In this work, we propose {AudioGen}, an auto-regressive generative model that generates audio samples conditioned on text inputs. {AudioGen} operates on a learnt discrete audio representation. The task of text-to-audio generation poses multiple challenges. Due to the way audio travels through a medium, differentiating ``objects'' can be a difficult task (e.g., separating multiple people simultaneously speaking). This is further complicated by real-world recording conditions (e.g., background noise, reverberation, etc.). Scarce text annotations impose another constraint, limiting the ability to scale models. Finally, modeling high-fidelity audio requires encoding audio at high sampling rate, leading to extremely long sequences. To alleviate the aforementioned challenges we propose an augmentation technique that mixes different audio samples, driving the model to internally learn to separate multiple sources. We curated 10 datasets containing different types of audio and text annotations to handle the scarcity of text-audio data points. For faster inference, we explore the use of multi-stream modeling, allowing the use of shorter sequences while maintaining a similar bitrate and perceptual quality. We apply classifier-free guidance to improve adherence to text. Comparing to the evaluated baselines, {AudioGen} outperforms over both objective and subjective metrics. Finally, we explore the ability of the proposed method to generate audio continuation conditionally and unconditionally.},

  abstract     = {In distributed computing, slower nodes (stragglers) usually become a bottleneck. Gradient Coding ({GC}), introduced by Tandon et al., is an efficient technique that uses principles of error-correcting codes to distribute gradient computation in the presence of stragglers. In this paper, we consider the distributed computation of a sequence of gradients $\{g^{(1)}, g^{(2)}, \ldots, g^{(J)}\}$, where processing of each gradient $g^{(t)}$ starts in round-$t$ and finishes by round-$(t+T)$. Here $T \geq 0$ denotes a delay parameter. For the {GC} scheme, coding is only across computing nodes and this results in a solution where $T=0$. On the other hand, having $T>0$ allows for designing schemes which exploit the temporal dimension as well. In this work, we propose two schemes that demonstrate improved performance compared to {GC}. Our first scheme combines {GC} with selective repetition of previously unfinished tasks and achieves improved straggler mitigation. In our second scheme, which constitutes our main contribution, we apply {GC} to a subset of the tasks and repetition for the remainder of the tasks. We then multiplex these two classes of tasks across workers and rounds in an adaptive manner, based on past straggler patterns. Using theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that our second scheme achieves significant reduction in the computational load. In our experiments, we study a practical setting of concurrently training multiple neural networks over an {AWS} Lambda cluster involving 256 worker nodes, where our framework naturally applies. We demonstrate that the latter scheme can yield a 16\% improvement in runtime over the baseline {GC} scheme, in the presence of naturally occurring, non-simulated stragglers.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a method to measure uncertainty in large language models. For tasks like question answering, it is essential to know when we can trust the natural language outputs of foundation models. We show that measuring uncertainty in natural language is challenging because of 'semantic equivalence'---different sentences can mean the same thing. To overcome these challenges we introduce semantic entropy---an entropy which incorporates linguistic invariances created by shared meanings. Our method is unsupervised, uses only a single model, and requires no modifications to off-the-shelf language models. In comprehensive ablation studies we show that the semantic entropy is more predictive of model accuracy on question answering data sets than comparable baselines.},

  abstract     = {Most approaches for self-supervised learning ({SSL}) are optimised on curated balanced datasets, e.g. {ImageNet}, despite the fact that natural data usually exhibits long-tail distributions. In this paper, we analyse the behaviour of one of the most popular variants of {SSL}, i.e. contrastive methods, on imbalanced data. In particular, we investigate the role of the temperature parameter $\tau$ in the contrastive loss, by analysing the loss through the lens of average distance maximisation, and find that a large $\tau$ emphasises group-wise discrimination, whereas a small $\tau$ leads to a higher degree of instance discrimination. While $\tau$ has thus far been treated exclusively as a constant hyperparameter, in this work, we propose to employ a dynamic $\tau$ and show that a simple cosine schedule can yield significant improvements in the learnt representations. Such a schedule results in a constant 'task switching' between an emphasis on instance discrimination and group-wise discrimination and thereby ensures that the model learns both group-wise features, as well as instance-specific details. Since frequent classes benefit from the former, while infrequent classes require the latter, we find this method to consistently improve separation between the classes in long-tail data without any additional computational cost.},

  abstract     = {Certified robustness in machine learning has primarily focused on adversarial perturbations with a fixed attack budget for each sample in the input distribution. In this work, we present provable robustness guarantees on the accuracy of a model under bounded Wasserstein shifts of the data distribution. We show that a simple procedure that randomizes the input of the model within a transformation space is provably robust to distributional shifts under that transformation. Our framework allows the datum-specific perturbation size to vary across different points in the input distribution and is general enough to include fixed-sized perturbations as well. Our certificates produce guaranteed lower bounds on the performance of the model for any shift (natural or adversarial) of the input distribution within a Wasserstein ball around the original distribution. We apply our technique to certify robustness against natural (non-adversarial) transformations of images such as color shifts, hue shifts, and changes in brightness and saturation. We obtain strong performance guarantees for the robust model under clearly visible shifts in the input images. Our experiments establish the non-vacuousness of our certificates by showing that the certified lower bound on a robust model's accuracy is higher than the empirical accuracy of an undefended model under a distribution shift. Moreover, our results also imply guaranteed lower bounds (hardness result) on the performance of models trained on so-called 'unlearnable' datasets that have been poisoned to interfere with model training. We show that the performance of a robust model is guaranteed to remain above a certain threshold on the test distribution even when the base model is trained on the poisoned dataset.},

  abstract     = {The potential of offline reinforcement learning ({RL}) is that high-capacity models trained on large, heterogeneous datasets can lead to agents that generalize broadly, analogously to similar advances in vision and {NLP}. However, recent works argue that offline {RL} methods encounter unique challenges to scaling up model capacity. Drawing on the learnings from these works, we re-examine previous design choices and find that with appropriate choices: {ResNets}, cross-entropy based distributional backups, and feature normalization, offline Q-learning algorithms exhibit strong performance that scales with model capacity. Using multi-task Atari as a testbed for scaling and generalization, we train a single policy on 40 games with near-human performance using up-to 80 million parameter networks, finding that model performance scales favorably with capacity. In contrast to prior work, we extrapolate beyond dataset performance even when trained entirely on a large (400M transitions) but highly suboptimal dataset (51\% human-level performance). Compared to return-conditioned supervised approaches, offline Q-learning scales similarly with model capacity and has better performance, especially when the dataset is suboptimal. Finally, we show that offline Q-learning with a diverse dataset is sufficient to learn powerful representations that facilitate rapid transfer to novel games and fast online learning on new variations of a training game, improving over existing state-of-the-art representation learning approaches.},

We introduce the class of quasi-homogeneous models, which is expressive enough to describe nearly all neural networks with homogeneous activations, even those with biases, residual connections, and normalization layers, while structured enough to enable geometric analysis of its gradient dynamics. Using this analysis, we generalize the existing results of maximum-margin bias for homogeneous networks to this richer class of models. We find that gradient flow implicitly favors a subset of the parameters, unlike in the case of a homogeneous model where all parameters are treated equally. We demonstrate through simple examples how this strong favoritism toward minimizing an asymmetric norm can degrade the robustness of quasi-homogeneous models. On the other hand, we conjecture that this norm-minimization discards, when possible, unnecessary higher-order parameters, reducing the model to a sparser parameterization. Lastly, by applying our theorem to sufficiently expressive neural networks with normalization layers, we reveal a universal mechanism behind the empirical phenomenon of Neural Collapse.},

However, our theoretical understanding of this discrepancy is lagging, preventing the development of significant improvements on either algorithm. Recent work advances the hypothesis that Adam and other heuristics like gradient clipping outperform {SGD} on language tasks because the distribution of the error induced by sampling has heavy tails. This suggests that Adam outperform {SGD} because it uses a more robust gradient estimate. We evaluate this hypothesis by varying the batch size, up to the entire dataset, to control for stochasticity. We present evidence that stochasticity and heavy-tailed noise are not major factors in the performance gap between {SGD} and Adam. Rather, Adam performs better as the batch size increases, while {SGD} is less effective at taking advantage of the reduction in noise. This raises the question as to why Adam outperforms {SGD} in the full-batch setting. Through further investigation of simpler variants of {SGD}, we find that the behavior of Adam with large batches is similar to sign descent with momentum.},

This is motivated by the nature of image-text paired data that both of the image and the text convey almost the same information but in different formats. The masked signal reconstruction of one modality conditioned on another modality can also implicitly learn cross-modal alignment between language tokens and image patches. Our experiments on various {V+L} tasks show that the proposed method, along with common {V+L} alignment losses, achieves state-of-the-art performance in the regime of millions of pre-training data. Also, we outperforms the other competitors by a significant margin in limited data scenarios.},

However, manually identifying and verifying the properties that contribute to accurate optical flow estimation require large-scale trial-and-error experiments with iteratively generating whole synthetic datasets and training on them, {\\ie}, impractical. To address this challenge, we propose a differentiable optical flow data generation pipeline and a loss function to drive the pipeline, called {DFlow}. {DFlow} efficiently synthesizes a dataset effective for a target domain without the need for cumbersome try-and-errors. This favorable property is achieved by proposing an efficient dataset comparison method that uses neural networks to approximately encode each dataset and compares the proxy networks instead of explicitly comparing datasets in a pairwise way. Our experiments show the competitive performance of our {DFlow} against the prior arts in pre-training. Furthermore, compared to competing datasets, {DFlow} achieves the best fine-tuning performance on the Sintel public benchmark with {RAFT}.},

Existing generalizable human {NeRF} methods that are conditioned on the body model have shown robustness against the geometric variation of arbitrary human performers. Yet they often exhibit blurry results when generalized onto unseen identities. Meanwhile, image-based rendering shows high-quality results when sufficient observations are available, whereas it suffers artifacts in sparse-view settings. We propose Neural Image-based Avatars ({NIA}) that exploits the best of those two methods: to maintain robustness under new articulations and self-occlusions while directly leveraging the available (sparse) source view colors to preserve appearance details of new subject identities. Our hybrid design outperforms recent methods on both in-domain identity generalization as well as challenging cross-dataset generalization settings. Also, in terms of the pose generalization, our method outperforms even the per-subject optimized animatable {NeRF} methods.},

This paper explores how to simplify reward design by using a large language model ({LLM}) such as {GPT}-3 as a proxy reward function, where the user provides a textual prompt containing a few examples (few-shot) or a description (zero-shot) of desired behavior. Our approach leverages this proxy reward function in an {RL} framework. Specifically, users specify a prompt once at the beginning of training. During training, the {LLM} evaluates an {RL} agent's behavior against the desired behavior described by the prompt and outputs a corresponding reward signal. The {RL} agent then uses this reward to update its behavior. We evaluate whether our approach can train agents aligned with user objectives in the Ultimatum Game, matrix games, and the DealOrNoDeal negotiation task. In all three tasks, we show that {RL} agents trained with our framework are well-aligned with the user's objectives and outperforms {RL} agents trained with reward functions learned via supervised learning.},

Unfortunately, due to the stochastic nature of diffusion models, it is often difficult to maintain the original content of the image during the reverse diffusion. To address this, here we present a novel diffusion-based unsupervised image translation method using disentangled style and content representation. Specifically, inspired by the splicing {Vision Transformer}, we extract intermediate keys of multihead self attention layer from {ViT} model and used them as the content preservation loss. Then, an image guided style transfer is performed by matching the {[CLS]} classification token from the denoised samples and target image, whereas additional {CLIP} loss is used for the text-driven style transfer. To further accelerate the semantic change during the reverse diffusion, we also propose a novel semantic divergence loss and resampling strategy. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in both text-guided and image-guided translation tasks.},

We show that the feature space that {FID} is (typically) computed in is so close to the {ImageNet} classifications that aligning the histograms of Top-$N$ classifications between sets of generated and real images can reduce {FID} substantially -- without actually improving the quality of results. Thus, we conclude that {FID} is prone to intentional or accidental distortions.

In this paper, we propose a complementary family of attacks that leave the model intact and manipulate {SHAP} explanations using stealthily biased sampling of the data points used to approximate expectations w.r.t the background distribution. In the context of fairness audit, we show that our attack can reduce the importance of a sensitive feature when explaining the difference in outcomes between groups while remaining undetected. More precisely, experiments performed on real-world datasets showed that our attack could yield up to a 90\% relative decrease in amplitude of the sensitive feature attribution. These results highlight the manipulability of {SHAP} explanations and encourage auditors to treat them with skepticism.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we define, evaluate, and improve the ``relay-generalization'' performance of reinforcement learning ({RL}) agents on the out-of-distribution ``controllable'' states. Ideally, an {RL} agent that generally masters a task should reach its goal starting from any controllable state of the environment instead of memorizing a small set of trajectories. For example, a self-driving system should be able to take over the control from humans in the middle of driving and must continue to drive the car safely. To practically evaluate this type of generalization, we start the test agent from the middle of other independently well-trained *stranger* agents' trajectories. With extensive experimental evaluation, we show the prevalence of *generalization failure* on controllable states from stranger agents. For example, in the Humanoid environment, we observed that a well-trained Proximal Policy Optimization ({PPO}) agent, with only 3.9\% failure rate during regular testing, failed on 81.6\% of the states generated by well-trained stranger {PPO} agents. To improve ``relay generalization,'' we propose a novel method called Self-Trajectory Augmentation ({STA}), which will reset the environment to the agent's old states according to the Q function during training. After applying {STA} to the Soft Actor Critic's ({SAC}) training procedure, we reduced the failure rate of {SAC} under relay-evaluation by more than three times in most settings without impacting agent performance and increasing the needed number of environment interactions.},

In this paper, we formulate text generation as progressively copying text segments (e.g., words or phrases) from an existing text collection. We compute the contextualized representations of meaningful text segments and index them using efficient vector search toolkits. The task of text generation is then decomposed into a series of copy-and-paste operations: at each time step, we seek suitable text spans from the text collection rather than selecting from a standalone vocabulary. Experiments on the standard language modeling benchmark ({WikiText-103}) show that our approach achieves better generation quality according to both automatic and human evaluations. Besides, its inference efficiency is comparable to token-level autoregressive models thanks to the reduction of decoding steps.},

  abstract     = {Many applications of quantum computing in the near term rely on variational quantum circuits (VQCs). They have been showcased as a promising model for reaching a quantum advantage in machine learning with current noisy intermediate scale quantum computers (NISQ). It is often believed that the power of VQCs relies on their exponentially large feature space, and extensive works have explored the expressiveness and trainability of VQCs in that regard. In our work, we propose a classical sampling method that may closely approximate a VQC with Hamiltonian encoding, given only the description of its architecture. It uses the seminal proposal of Random Fourier Features (RFF) and the fact that VQCs can be seen as large Fourier series. We provide general theoretical bounds for classically approximating models built from exponentially large quantum feature space by sampling a few frequencies to build an equivalent low dimensional kernel, and we show experimentally that this approximation is efficient for several encoding strategies. Precisely, we show that the number of required samples grows favorably with the size of the quantum spectrum. This tool therefore questions the hope for quantum advantage from VQCs in many cases, but conversely helps to narrow the conditions for their potential success. We expect VQCs with various and complex encoding Hamiltonians, or with large input dimension, to become more robust to classical approximations.},

While highly general, their learning dynamics are often times heuristic and inflexible - exactly the limitations that meta-learning can address. Hence, we propose to discover effective update rules for evolution strategies via meta-learning. Concretely, our approach employs a search strategy parametrized by a self-attention-based architecture, which guarantees the update rule is invariant to the ordering of the candidate solutions. We show that meta-evolving this system on a small set of representative low-dimensional analytic optimization problems is sufficient to discover new evolution strategies capable of generalizing to unseen optimization problems, population sizes and optimization horizons. Furthermore, the same learned evolution strategy can outperform established neuroevolution baselines on supervised and continuous control tasks. As additional contributions, we ablate the individual neural network components of our method; reverse engineer the learned strategy into an explicit heuristic form, which remains highly competitive; and show that it is possible to self-referentially train an evolution strategy from scratch, with the learned update rule used to drive the outer meta-learning loop.},

Despite the progress in the field of continual learning to overcome this forgetting, we show that a set of common state-of-the-art methods still suffers from substantial forgetting upon starting to learn new tasks, except that this forgetting is temporary and followed by a phase of performance recovery. We refer to this intriguing but potentially problematic phenomenon as the stability gap. The stability gap had likely remained under the radar due to standard practice in the field of evaluating continual learning models only after each task. Instead, we establish a framework for continual evaluation that uses per-iteration evaluation and we define a new set of metrics to quantify worst-case performance. Empirically we show that experience replay, constraint-based replay, knowledge-distillation, and parameter regularization methods are all prone to the stability gap; and that the stability gap can be observed in class-, task-, and domain-incremental learning benchmarks. Additionally, a controlled experiment shows that the stability gap increases when tasks are more dissimilar. Finally, by disentangling gradients into plasticity and stability components, we propose a conceptual explanation for the stability gap.},

In contrast, we show that certain methods employing a non-linear reconstruction mechanism can overcome these fundamental lower bounds and approximate the underlying operator efficiently. The latter class includes Fourier Neural Operators and a novel extension of DeepONet termed shift-DeepONet. Our theoretical findings are confirmed by empirical results for advection equation, inviscid Burgers' equation and compressible Euler equations of aerodynamics.},

A dataset of learning histories is generated by a source RL algorithm, and then a causal transformer is trained by autoregressively predicting actions given their preceding learning histories as context. Unlike sequential policy prediction architectures that distill post-learning or expert sequences, AD is able to improve its policy entirely in-context without updating its network parameters. We demonstrate that AD can reinforcement learn in-context in a variety of environments with sparse rewards, combinatorial task structure, and pixel-based observations, and find that AD learns a more data-efficient RL algorithm than the one that generated the source data.},

We provide a counterexample to a corollary of Danskin's theorem from the seminal work of Madry et al. (2018), which incorrectly states that solutions of the inner maximization problem yield descent directions for the robust loss. Based on a correct interpretation of Danskin's theorem, we propose Danskin's Descent Direction (DDi) and demonstrate experimentally that it provides better descent directions than standard PGD adversaries. Using CIFAR-10, we show that our method achieves steeper increases in robustness during early training stages and exhibits greater stability than PGD baselines for networks without BatchNorm.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning applications frequently come with multiple diverse objectives and constraints that can change over time. Accordingly, trained models can be tuned with sets of hyper-parameters that affect their predictive behavior (e.g., their run-time efficiency versus error rate). As the number of constraints and hyper-parameter dimensions grow, naively selected settings may lead to sub-optimal and/or unreliable results. We develop an efficient method for calibrating models such that their predictions provably satisfy multiple explicit and simultaneous statistical guarantees (e.g., upper-bounded error rates), while also optimizing any number of additional, unconstrained objectives (e.g., total run-time cost). Building on recent results in distribution-free, finite-sample risk control for general losses, we propose Pareto Testing: a two-stage process which combines multi-objective optimization with multiple hypothesis testing. The optimization stage constructs a set of promising combinations on the Pareto frontier. We then apply statistical testing to this frontier only to identify configurations that have (i) high utility with respect to our objectives, and (ii) guaranteed risk levels with respect to our constraints, with specifiable high probability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to reliably accelerate the execution of large-scale Transformer models in natural language processing (NLP) applications. In particular, we show how Pareto Testing can be used to dynamically configure multiple inter-dependent model attributes -- including the number of layers computed before exiting, number of attention heads pruned, or number of text tokens considered -- to simultaneously control and optimize various accuracy and cost metrics.},

We leverage grouped convolutions to parallelize the ensemble into a single shared backbone and forward pass to improve training and inference speeds. PE is designed to operate within the memory limits of a standard neural network. Our extensive research indicates that PE accurately preserves the properties of DE, such as diversity, and performs equally well in terms of accuracy, calibration, out-of-distribution detection, and robustness to distribution shift.},

For downstream classification, we formally prove that the SEM representation leads to better generalization than an unnormalized representation. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that SSL methods trained with SEMs have improved generalization on natural image datasets such as CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. Finally, when used in a downstream classification task, we show that SEM features exhibit emergent semantic coherence where small groups of learned features are distinctly predictive of semantically-relevant classes.},

Spacetimes intrinsically contain a causal structure that indicates whether or not there exists a causal or even chronological order between points of the manifold, called events. This chronological order allows us to naturally represent directed edges via imposing the correct ordering when the nodes are embedded as events in the spacetime. Previous work in machine learning only considers embeddings lying on the simplest Lorentz manifold or does not exploit the connection between Lorentzian pre-length spaces and directed graphs. We introduce a well-defined approach to map data onto a general family of spacetimes and empirically evaluate our framework in the tasks of hierarchy extraction of undirected graphs, directed link prediction and representation of directed graphs.},

Speech enhancement (SE) can be used as a front-end strategy to aid automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. However, existing training objectives of SE methods are not fully effective at integrating speech-text and noise-clean paired data for training toward unseen ASR systems. In this study, we propose a general denoising framework, D4AM, for various downstream acoustic models. Our framework fine-tunes the SE model with the backward gradient according to a specific acoustic model and the corresponding classification objective. In addition, our method aims to consider the regression objective as an auxiliary loss to make the SE model generalize to other unseen acoustic models. To jointly train an SE unit with regression and classification objectives, D4AM uses an adjustment scheme to directly estimate suitable weighting coefficients rather than undergoing a grid search process with additional training costs. The adjustment scheme consists of two parts: gradient calibration and regression objective weighting. The experimental results show that D4AM can consistently and effectively provide improvements to various unseen acoustic models and outperforms other combination setups. Specifically, when evaluated on the Google ASR API with real noisy data completely unseen during SE training, D4AM achieves a relative WER reduction of 24.65\% compared with the direct feeding of noisy input. To our knowledge, this is the first work that deploys an effective combination scheme of regression (denoising) and classification (ASR) objectives to derive a general pre-processor applicable to various unseen ASR systems.},

Previous DaNAS methods have mostly tackled the search for the neural architecture for fixed datasets and the teacher, which are not generalized well on a new task consisting of an unseen dataset and an unseen teacher, thus need to perform a costly search for any new combination of the datasets and the teachers. For standard NAS tasks without KD, meta-learning-based computationally efficient NAS methods have been proposed, which learn the generalized search process over multiple tasks (datasets) and transfer the knowledge obtained over those tasks to a new task. However, since they assume learning from scratch without KD from a teacher, they might not be ideal for DaNAS scenarios, which could significantly affect the final performances of the architectures obtained from the search. To eliminate the excessive computational cost of DaNAS methods and the sub-optimality of rapid NAS methods, we propose a distillation-aware meta accuracy prediction model, DaSS (Distillation-aware Student Search), which can predict a given architecture's final performances on a dataset when performing KD with a given teacher, without having actually to train it on the target task. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed meta-prediction model successfully generalizes to multiple unseen datasets for DaNAS tasks, largely outperforming existing meta-NAS methods and rapid NAS baselines.},

Hierarchical transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) reintroduced several ConvNet priors and further enhanced the practical viability of adapting volumetric segmentation in 3D medical datasets. The effectiveness of hybrid approaches is largely credited to the large receptive field for non-local self-attention and the large number of model parameters. In this work, we propose a lightweight volumetric ConvNet, termed 3D UX-Net, which adapts the hierarchical transformer using ConvNet modules for robust volumetric segmentation. Specifically, we revisit volumetric depth-wise convolutions with large kernel (LK) size (e.g. starting from $7 \times 7 \times 7$) to enable the larger global receptive fields, inspired by Swin Transformer. We further substitute the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in Swin Transformer blocks with pointwise depth convolutions and enhance model performances with fewer normalization and activation layers, thus reducing the number of model parameters. 3D UX-Net competes favorably with current SOTA transformers (e.g. SwinUNETR) using three challenging public datasets on volumetric brain and abdominal imaging: 1) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FLARE, 2) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FeTA, and 3) MICCAI Challenge 2022 AMOS. 3D UX-Net consistently outperforms SwinUNETR with improvement from 0.929 to 0.938 Dice (FLARE2021) and 0.867 to 0.874 Dice (Feta2021).

Real-time prediction on resource-constrained hardware is even more crucial in the real-world problems. The deep operator network (DeepONet) has recently been proposed as a framework for learning nonlinear mappings between function spaces. However, the DeepONet requires many parameters and has a high computational cost when learning operators, particularly those with complex (discontinuous or non-smooth) target functions. In this study, we propose HyperDeepONet, which uses the expressive power of the hypernetwork to enable learning of a complex operator with smaller set of parameters. The DeepONet and its variant models can be thought of as a method of injecting the input function information into the target function. From this perspective, these models can be viewed as a special case of HyperDeepONet. We analyze the complexity of DeepONet and conclude that HyperDeepONet needs relatively lower complexity to obtain the desired accuracy for operator learning. HyperDeepONet was successfully applied to various operator learning problems using low computational resources compared to other benchmarks.},

We propose a new sharpness measure (interaction-aware-sharpness) aware of the \emph{interaction} between the batch gradient distribution and the loss landscape geometry. This leads to a more refined and general characterization of the edge of stability for SGD.

In recent years, various training techniques have been developed, e.g., better divergence measures or stabilization in MCMC sampling, but there often exists a large gap between EBMs and other generative frameworks like GANs in terms of generation quality. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective framework for improving EBMs via contrastive representation learning (CRL). To be specific, we consider representations learned by contrastive methods as the true underlying latent variable. This contrastive latent variable could guide EBMs to understand the data structure better, so it can improve and accelerate EBM training significantly. To enable the joint training of EBM and CRL, we also design a new class of latent-variable EBMs for learning the joint density of data and the contrastive latent variable. Our experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves lower FID scores, compared to prior-art EBM methods (e.g., additionally using variational autoencoders or diffusion techniques), even with significantly faster and more memory-efficient training. We also show conditional and compositional generation abilities of our latent-variable EBMs as their additional benefits, even without explicit conditional training.},

  abstract     = {Pre-training a large transformer model on a massive amount of unlabeled data and fine-tuning it on labeled datasets for diverse downstream tasks has proven to be a successful strategy, for a variety of vision and natural language processing tasks. However, direct fine-tuning of the pre-trained model may be suboptimal if there exist large discrepancies across data domains for pre-training and fine-tuning. To tackle this issue, several previous studies have proposed further pre-training strategies, where we continue to pre-train the model on the target unlabeled dataset before fine-tuning. However, all of them solely focus on language models and we empirically find that a Vision Transformer is vulnerable to overfitting as we continue to pretrain the model on target unlabeled data. In order to tackle this limitation, we propose self-distillation as a regularization for a further pre-training stage. Specifically, we first further pre-train the initial pre-trained model on the target unlabeled data and then consider it as a teacher for self-distillation. Then we take the same initial pre-trained model as a student and enforce its hidden representations to be close to those of the teacher while optimizing the student with a masked auto-encoding objective. We empirically validate the efficacy of self-distillation on a variety of benchmark datasets for image and text classification tasks. Experimentally, we show that our proposed method outperforms all the relevant baselines. Theoretically, we analyze the proposed method with a simplified model to understand how self-distillation for further pre-training can potentially help improve the performance of the downstream tasks.},

  abstract     = {Despite Transformers' success across text, vision, and speech domains, they have not become standard for mobile and edge applications due to heavy memory and computational requirements. While various approaches exist to reduce Transformer complexity (pruning weights/attentions/tokens, quantization, distillation), we focus on token pruning, which reduces complexity of both attention operations and linear layers. The key problem with previous token pruning approaches is that they often remove tokens during the feed-forward stage without considering their impact on later layers' attentions, creating a risk of dropping important tokens for the given task. To address this issue, we propose an attention back-tracking method that tracks the importance of each attention in a Transformer architecture from the outputs to the inputs, preserving tokens that have large impact on final predictions. Our method represents an innovative approach to making Transformers more efficient for mobile and edge deployment by intelligently preserving important tokens through attention back-tracking rather than naive token pruning.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised meta-learning (UML) shares the spirit of self-supervised learning (SSL) in learning models without human supervision that can be adapted to downstream tasks. The learning objective of self-supervised learning, which pulls positive pairs closer and repels negative pairs, resembles metric-based meta-learning, one of the most successful meta-learning methods that learns to minimize distance between representations from the same class. A notable aspect of metric-based meta-learning is that it is widely interpreted as a set-level problem since the inference of discriminative class prototypes (or set representations) from few examples is crucial for downstream task performance. Motivated by this, we propose Set-SimCLR, a novel self-supervised set representation learning framework for targeting UML problems. Set-SimCLR learns a set encoder on top of instance representations to maximize the agreement between two sets of augmented samples, which are generated by applying stochastic augmentations to a given image. We theoretically analyze how our proposed set representation learning can potentially improve the generalization performance at the meta-test. We also empirically validate its effectiveness on various benchmark datasets, showing that Set-SimCLR largely outperforms both UML and instance-level self-supervised learning baselines.},

We introduce periodic activation function and anti-aliased representation into the GAN generator, which brings the desired inductive bias for audio synthesis and significantly improves audio quality. In addition, we train our GAN vocoder at the largest scale up to 112M parameters, which is unprecedented in the literature. We identify and address the failure modes in large-scale GAN training for audio, while maintaining high-fidelity output without over-regularization.

  abstract     = {Since the introduction of Transformers, researchers have tackled the notoriously expensive quadratic complexity problem. While significant computational efficiency improvements have been achieved, they come at the cost of reduced accuracy trade-offs. In this paper, we propose Composite Slice Transformer (CST), a Transformer-based network equipped with a composition of multi-scale multi-range attentions, boosting both efficiency and modeling capability. After stacking fixed-length slices of the input sequence, each layer in CST performs a pair of fine-and-coarse-grained attentions with short-long ranges in a sequential manner, coupled with volatile instant positional embedding, enabling efficient token interactions {em and} improving expressiveness of the model. In addition to significantly reduced $O(NL+N^2/L^2)$ complexity for sequence length $N$ and slice length $L$, CST achieves superior performance on a variety of tasks. We show that CST surpasses recently published efficient Transformers on the Long Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating the bidirectional long-range dependency modeling capability of our model. It outperforms the standard Transformer by a margin of $6.9$% in average accuracy across the five classification tasks of the benchmark, while being of complexity comparable to other efficient transformers. Furthermore, on the word-level autoregressive language modeling task with the WikiText-103 dataset, CST performs competitively against the Transformer model with only $2$% gap in the test perplexity while outperforming other efficient Transformers.},

The main idea is to design a classification problem for distinguishing training data from samples from an (easy-to-sample) noise distribution $q$, in a manner that avoids having to calculate a partition function. It is well-known that the choice of $q$ can severely impact the computational and statistical efficiency of NCE. In practice, a common choice for $q$ is a Gaussian which matches the mean and covariance of the data. In this paper, we show that such a choice can result in an exponentially bad (in the ambient dimension) conditioning of the Hessian of the loss - even for very simple data distributions. As a consequence, both the statistical and algorithmic complexity for such a choice of $q$ will be problematic in practice - suggesting that more complex noise distributions are essential to the success of NCE.},

  abstract     = {Masked image modeling (MIM) has become a popular strategy for self-supervised learning (SSL) of visual representations with Vision Transformers. A representative MIM model, the masked auto-encoder (MAE), randomly masks a subset of image patches and reconstructs the masked patches given the unmasked patches. Concurrently, many recent works in self-supervised learning utilize the student/teacher paradigm which provides the student with an additional target based on the output of a teacher composed of an exponential moving average (EMA) of previous students. Although common, relatively little is known about the dynamics of the interaction between the student and teacher. Through analysis on a simple linear model, we find that the teacher conditionally removes previous gradient directions based on feature similarities which effectively acts as a conditional momentum regularizer. From this analysis, we present a simple SSL method, the Reconstruction-Consistent Masked Auto-Encoder (RC-MAE) by adding an EMA teacher to MAE. We find that RC-MAE converges faster and requires less memory usage than state-of-the-art self-distillation methods during pre-training, which may provide a way to enhance the practicality of prohibitively expensive self-supervised learning of Vision Transformer models. Additionally, we show that RC-MAE achieves more robustness and better performance compared to MAE on downstream tasks such as ImageNet-1K classification, object detection, and instance segmentation.},

  abstract     = {A Neural Process (NP) estimates a stochastic process implicitly defined with neural networks given a stream of data, rather than pre-specifying priors already known, such as Gaussian processes. An ideal NP would learn everything from data without any inductive biases, but in practice, we often restrict the class of stochastic processes for the ease of estimation. One such restriction is the use of a finite-dimensional latent variable accounting for the uncertainty in the functions drawn from NPs. Some recent works show that this can be improved with more "data-driven" source of uncertainty such as bootstrapping. In this work, we take a different approach based on the martingale posterior, a recently developed alternative to Bayesian inference. For the martingale posterior, instead of specifying prior-likelihood pairs, a predictive distribution for future data is specified. Under specific conditions on the predictive distribution, it can be shown that the uncertainty in the generated future data actually corresponds to the uncertainty of the implicitly defined Bayesian posteriors. Based on this result, instead of assuming any form of the latent variables, we equip a NP with a predictive distribution implicitly defined with neural networks and use the corresponding martingale posteriors as the source of uncertainty. The resulting model, which we name as Martingale Posterior Neural Process (MPNP), is demonstrated to outperform baselines on various tasks.},

We design a novel autoencoder architecture capable of learning a structured representation without the need for aggressive regularization. Our structural decoders learn a hierarchy of latent variables, thereby ordering the information without any additional regularization or supervision. We demonstrate how these models learn a representation that improves results in a variety of downstream tasks including generation, disentanglement, and extrapolation using several challenging and natural image datasets.},

Our proposed algorithm generalizes the Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) method, used for signal recovery under $\ell_1$ and nuclear-norm constrained minimization. Further, we interpret our overall minimization approach as a recurrent network that we then employ to deal with inverse low-level computer vision problems. Thanks to the convergence guarantees that our IRLS strategy offers, we are able to train the derived reconstruction networks using a memory-efficient implicit back-propagation scheme, which does not pose any restrictions on their effective depth. To assess our networks' performance, we compare them against other existing reconstruction methods on several inverse problems, namely image deblurring, super-resolution, demosaicking and sparse recovery. Our reconstruction results are shown to be very competitive and in many cases outperform those of existing unrolled networks, whose number of parameters is orders of magnitude higher than that of our learned models.},

  abstract     = {The optimal transportation map finds the most economical way to transport one probability measure to another, and it has been applied in a broad range of applications in machine learning and computer vision. By the Brenier theory, computing the optimal transport map is equivalent to solving a Monge-Ampère equation, which is highly non-linear. Therefore, the computation of optimal transportation maps is intrinsically challenging. In this work, we propose a novel and powerful method, the FFT-OT (fast Fourier transform-optimal transport), to compute the 3-dimensional OT problems. The method is based on several key ideas: first, the Monge-Ampère equation is linearized to a sequence of linear elliptic PDEs with spacial and temporal variant coefficients; second, the obliqueness property of optimal transportation maps is reformulated as a Neumann boundary condition; and third, the variant coefficient elliptic PDEs are approximated by constant coefficient elliptic PDEs and solved by FFT on GPUs. We also prove that the algorithm converges linearly, namely the approximation error decreases exponentially fast. Experimental results show that the FFT-OT algorithm is more than a hundred times faster than the conventional methods based on the convex geometry. Furthermore, the method can be directly applied for sampling from complex 3D density functions in machine learning and magnifying the volumetric data in medical imaging.},

Point cloud triangulation solves this problem by providing edge information to the input points. Since no vertex interpolation is involved, it is beneficial to preserve sharp details on the surface. Taking advantage of learning-based techniques in triangulation, existing methods enumerate the complete combinations of candidate triangles, which is both complex and inefficient. In this paper, we leverage the duality between a triangle and its circumcenter, and introduce a deep neural network that detects the circumcenters to achieve point cloud triangulation. Specifically, we introduce multiple anchor priors to divide the neighborhood space of each point. The neural network then learns to predict the presences and locations of circumcenters under the guidance of those anchors. We extract the triangles dual to the detected circumcenters to form a primitive mesh, from which an edge-manifold mesh is produced via simple post-processing. Unlike existing learning-based triangulation methods, the proposed method bypasses an exhaustive enumeration of triangle combinations and local surface parameterization. We validate the efficiency, generalization, and robustness of our method on prominent datasets of both watertight and open surfaces.

Previous research has shown that deep neural networks tend to be over-confident, and we find that sparse training exacerbates this problem. Therefore, calibrating the sparse models is crucial for reliable prediction and decision making. In this paper, we propose a new sparse training method to produce sparse models with improved confidence calibration. In contrast to previous research that uses only one mask to control the sparse topology, our method utilizes two masks, including a deterministic mask and a random mask. The former efficiently searches and activates important weights by exploiting the magnitude of weights and gradients. While the latter brings better exploration and finds more appropriate weight values by random updates. Theoretically, we prove our method can be viewed as a hierarchical variational approximation of a probabilistic deep Gaussian process. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, model architectures, and sparsities show that our method can reduce ECE values by up to 47.8% and simultaneously maintain or even improve accuracy with only a slight increase in computational and storage burden.},

As it simply requires the addition of external nodes without altering the existing network structure or optimization algorithms, this method can be easily incorporated into many standard problem specifications. We find improved stability against a number of data perturbations, including domain shifts, with the most dramatic improvement obtained for unstructured noise, where our technique outperforms other existing methods such as dropout or $L_2$ regularization, in some cases. We further show that desirable generalization properties on clean data are generally maintained.},

In this work, we explore the benefits that representation learning provides for knowledge transfer in the tabular domain. We conduct experiments in a realistic medical diagnosis test bed with limited amounts of downstream data and find that transfer learning with deep tabular models provides a definitive advantage over gradient boosted decision tree methods. We further compare the supervised and self-supervised pretraining strategies and provide practical advice on transfer learning with tabular models. Finally, we propose a pseudo-feature method for cases where the upstream and downstream feature sets differ, a tabular-specific problem widespread in real-world applications.},

The corrector kernel is trained to make the correction steps achieve asymptotic convergence, in distribution, to the correct marginal of the intermediate diffusion states.

  abstract     = {Recent studies have shown that structural perturbations are significantly effective in degrading the accuracy of Graph Neural Networks ({GNNs}) in the semi-supervised node classification ({SSNC}) task. However, why the gradient-based methods are so destructive is rarely explored. In this work, we discover an interesting phenomenon: the adversarial edges are not uniformly distributed on the graph. Nearly all perturbations are generated around the training nodes in poisoning attack. Combined with this phenomenon, we provide an explanation for the effectiveness of the gradient-based attack method from a data distribution perspective and revisit both poisoning attack and evasion attack in {SSNC}. From this new perspective, we empirically and theoretically discuss some other attack tendencies. Based on the analysis, we provide nine practical tips on both attack and defense and meanwhile leverage them to improve existing attack and defense methods. Moreover, we design a fast attack method and a self-training defense method, which outperform the state-of-the-art methods and can effectively scale to large graphs like ogbn-arxiv. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets to verify our claims.},

  abstract     = {Vision Transformers ({ViTs}) with self-attention modules have recently achieved great empirical success in many vision tasks. Due to non-convex interactions across layers, however, the theoretical learning and generalization analysis is mostly elusive. Based on a data model characterizing both label-relevant and label-irrelevant tokens, this paper provides the first theoretical analysis of training a three-layer {ViT}, i.e., one self-attention layer followed by a two-layer perceptron, for a classification task. We characterize the sample complexity to achieve a zero generalization error. Our sample complexity bound is positively correlated with the inverse of the fraction of label-relevant tokens, the token noise level, and the initial model error. We also prove that a training process using stochastic gradient descent ({SGD}) leads to a sparse attention map, which is a formal verification of the general intuition about the success of attention. Moreover, this paper indicates that a proper token sparsification can improve the test performance by removing label-irrelevant and/or noisy tokens, including spurious correlations. Empirical experiments on synthetic data and {CIFAR}-10 dataset justify our theoretical results and generalize to deeper {ViTs}.},

  abstract     = {Graph Neural Networks ({GNNs}) are widely used deep learning models that can extract meaningful representations from graph datasets and achieve great success in many machine learning tasks. Among them, graph neural networks with iterative iterations like unfolded {GNNs} and implicit {GNNs} can effectively capture long-range dependencies in graphs and demonstrate superior performance on large graphs since they can mathematically ensure its convergence to some nontrivial solution after lots of aggregations. However, the aggregation time for such models costs a lot as they need to aggregate the full graph in each update. Such weakness limits the scalability of the implicit graph models. To tackle such limitations, we propose two unbiased stochastic proximal solvers inspired by the stochastic proximal gradient descent method and its variance reduction variant called {USP} and {USP}-{VR} solvers. From the point of stochastic optimization, we theoretically prove that our solvers are unbiased, which can converge to the same solution as the original solvers for unfolded {GNNs} and implicit {GNNs}. Furthermore, the computation complexities for unfolded {GNNs} and implicit {GNNs} with our proposed solvers are significantly less than their vanilla versions. Experiments on various large graph datasets show that our proposed solvers are more efficient and can achieve state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Neuro-symbolic learning generally consists of two separated worlds, i.e., neural network training and symbolic constraint solving, whose success hinges on symbol grounding, a fundamental problem in {AI}. This paper presents a novel, softened symbol grounding process, bridging the gap between the two worlds, and resulting in an effective and efficient neuro-symbolic learning framework. Technically, the framework features (1) modeling of symbol solution states as a Boltzmann distribution, which avoids expensive state searching and facilitates mutually beneficial interactions between network training and symbolic reasoning; (2) a new {MCMC} technique leveraging projection and {SMT} solvers, which efficiently samples from disconnected symbol solution spaces; (3) an annealing mechanism that can escape from sub-optimal symbol groundings. Experiments with three representative neuro-symbolic learning tasks demonstrate that, owing to its superior symbol grounding capability, our framework successfully solves problems well beyond the frontier of the existing proposals.},

In this paper, we introduce a benchmark, named {GAIN}, to analyze the GeneralizAbility of INstructional action understanding models. In {GAIN}, we reassemble steps of existing instructional video training datasets to construct the {OOD} tasks and then collect the corresponding videos. We evaluate the generalizability of models trained on in-distribution datasets with the performance on {OOD} videos and observe a significant performance drop. We further propose a simple yet effective approach, which cuts off the excessive contextual dependency of action steps by performing causal inference, to provide a potential direction for enhancing the {OOD} generalizability. In the experiments, we show that this simple approach can improve several baselines on both instructional action segmentation and detection tasks. We expect the introduction of the {GAIN} dataset will promote future in-depth research on the generalization of instructional video understanding.},

To reach this challenging goal without depth input, we introduce a hierarchical feature volume to facilitate the implicit map decoder. This design effectively fuses shape cues across different scales to facilitate map reconstruction. Our method simultaneously solves the camera motion and the neural implicit map by matching the rendered and input video frames. To facilitate optimization, we further propose a photometric warping loss in the spirit of multi-view stereo to better constrain the camera pose and scene geometry. We evaluate our method on commonly used benchmarks and compare it with modern {RGB} and {RGB}-D {SLAM} systems.

In this paper, we propose {FaiREE}, a fair classification algorithm which can satisfy group fairness constraints with finite-sample and distribution-free theoretical guarantees. {FaiREE} can be adapted to satisfying various group fairness notions (e.g., Equality of Opportunity, Equalized Odds, Demographic Parity, etc.) and achieve the optimal accuracy. These theoretical guarantees are further supported by experiments on both synthetic and real data. {FaiREE} is shown to have favorable performance over state-of-the-art algorithms.},

They exhibit great potential for helping reduce ill-posedness and attain high-quality results. However, the latent tensors of such deep generative models can fall out of the desired high-dimensional standard Gaussian distribution during inversion, particularly in the presence of data noise and inaccurate forward models, leading to low-fidelity solutions. To address this issue, we propose to reparameterize and Gaussianize the latent tensors using novel differentiable data-dependent layers wherein custom operators are defined by solving optimization problems. These proposed layers constrain inverse problems to obtain high-fidelity in-distribution solutions. We validate our technique on three inversion tasks: compressive-sensing {MRI}, image deblurring, and eikonal tomography (a nonlinear {PDE}-constrained inverse problem) using two representative deep generative models: {StyleGAN}2 and {G}low. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and consistency.},

Most past algorithms either apply single-solution optimization methods from multiple random initial guesses or search in the vicinity of found solutions using ad hoc heuristics. We present an end-to-end method to learn the proximal operator of a family of training problems so that multiple local minima can be quickly obtained from initial guesses by iterating the learned operator, emulating the proximal-point algorithm that has fast convergence. The learned proximal operator can be further generalized to recover multiple optima for unseen problems at test time, enabling applications such as object detection. The key ingredient in our formulation is a proximal regularization term, which elevates the convexity of our training loss: by applying recent theoretical results, we show that for weakly-convex objectives with {L}ipschitz gradients, training of the proximal operator converges globally with a practical degree of over-parameterization. We further present an exhaustive benchmark for multi-solution optimization to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

In this paper, we treat the evaluation of representations as a model selection problem and propose to use the Minimum Description Length ({MDL}) principle to devise an evaluation metric. Contrary to the established practice of limiting the capacity of the readout model, we design a hybrid discrete and continuous-valued model space for the readout models and employ a switching strategy to combine their predictions. The {MDL} score takes model complexity, as well as data efficiency into account. As a result, the most appropriate model for the specific task and representation will be chosen, making it a unified measure for comparison. The proposed metric can be efficiently computed with an online method and we present results for pre-trained vision encoders of various architectures ({ResNet} and {ViT}) and objective functions (supervised and self-supervised) on a range of downstream tasks. We compare our methods with accuracy-based approaches and show that the latter are inconsistent when multiple readout models are used. Finally, we discuss important properties revealed by our evaluations such as model scaling, preferred readout model, and data efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional models have been widely used in multiple domains. However, most existing models only use local convolution, making the model unable to handle long-range dependencies efficiently. Attention overcomes this problem by aggregating global information based on the pair-wise attention score but also makes the computational complexity quadratic to the sequence length. Recently, Gu et al. proposed a model called {S}4 inspired by the state space model. {S}4 can be efficiently implemented as a global convolutional model whose kernel size equals the input sequence length. With Fast Fourier Transform, {S}4 can model much longer sequences than Transformers and achieve significant gains over {SoTA} on several long-range tasks. Despite its empirical success, {S}4 is involved. It requires sophisticated parameterization and initialization schemes that combine the wisdom from several prior works. As a result, {S}4 is less intuitive and hard to use for researchers with limited prior knowledge. Here we aim to demystify {S}4 and extract basic principles that contribute to the success of {S}4 as a global convolutional model. We focus on the structure of the convolution kernel and identify two critical but intuitive principles enjoyed by {S}4 that are sufficient to make up an effective global convolutional model: 1) The parameterization of the convolutional kernel needs to be efficient in the sense that the number of parameters should scale sub-linearly with sequence length. 2) The kernel needs to satisfy a decaying structure that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. Based on the two principles, we propose a simple yet effective convolutional model called Structured Global Convolution ({SGConv}). {SGConv} exhibits strong empirical performance over several tasks: 1) With faster speed, {SGConv} surpasses the previous {SoTA} on Long Range Arena and Speech Command datasets. 2) When plugging {SGConv} into standard language and vision models, it shows the potential to improve both efficiency and performance.},

Language models such as {GPT}-3 are capable of textual reasoning but cannot understand visual information, while vision models such as {DALL-E} can generate photorealistic photos but fail to understand complex language descriptions. In this work, we propose a unified framework for composing ensembles of different pre-trained models -- combining the strengths of each individual model to solve various multimodal problems in a zero-shot manner. We use pre-trained models as `generators' or `scorers' and compose them via closed-loop iterative consensus optimization. The generator constructs proposals and the scorers iteratively provide feedback to refine the generated result. Such closed-loop communication enables models to correct errors caused by other models, significantly boosting performance on downstream tasks, e.g. improving accuracy on grade school math problems by 7.5\%, without requiring any model finetuning. We demonstrate that consensus achieved by an ensemble of scorers outperforms the feedback of a single scorer, by leveraging the strengths of each expert model. Results show that the proposed method can be used as a general purpose framework for a wide range of zero-shot multimodal tasks, such as image generation, video question answering, mathematical reasoning, and robotic manipulation.},

The new standard unveils many issues in existing approaches for low-light image enhancement ({LLIE}), especially in dealing with the intricate issue of joint luminance enhancement and noise removal while remaining efficient. Unlike existing methods that address the problem in the spatial domain, we propose a new solution, {UHDFour}, that embeds Fourier transform into a cascaded network. Our approach is motivated by a few unique characteristics in the Fourier domain: 1) most luminance information concentrates on amplitudes while noise is closely related to phases, and 2) a high-resolution image and its low-resolution version share similar amplitude patterns. Through embedding Fourier into our network, the amplitude and phase of a low-light image are separately processed to avoid amplifying noise when enhancing luminance. Besides, {UHDFour} is scalable to {UHD} images by implementing amplitude and phase enhancement under the low-resolution regime and then adjusting the high-resolution scale with few computations. We also contribute the first real {UHD} {LLIE} dataset, {UHD-LL}, that contains 2,150 low-noise/normal-clear 4K image pairs with diverse darkness and noise levels captured in different scenarios. With this dataset, we systematically analyze the performance of existing {LLIE} methods for processing {UHD} images and demonstrate the advantage of our solution. We believe our new framework, coupled with the dataset, would push the frontier of {LLIE} towards {UHD}. The code and dataset are available at https://li-chongyi.github.io/UHDFour/.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we aim to learn dexterous manipulation of deformable objects using multi-fingered hands. Reinforcement learning approaches for dexterous rigid object manipulation would struggle in this setting due to the complexity of physics interaction with deformable objects. At the same time, previous trajectory optimization approaches with differentiable physics for deformable manipulation would suffer from local optima caused by the explosion of contact modes from hand-object interactions. To address these challenges, we propose {DexDeform}, a principled framework that abstracts dexterous manipulation skills from human demonstration, and refines the learned skills with differentiable physics. Concretely, we first collect a small set of human demonstrations using teleoperation. And we then train a skill model using demonstrations for planning over action abstractions in imagination. To explore the goal space, we further apply augmentations to the existing deformable shapes in demonstrations and use a gradient optimizer to refine the actions planned by the skill model. Finally, we adopt the refined trajectories as new demonstrations for finetuning the skill model. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce a suite of six challenging dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks. Compared with baselines, {DexDeform} is able to better explore and generalize across novel goals unseen in the initial human demonstrations.

The algorithm provides polynomial sample complexity guarantees independent of state space size and demonstrates improved performance in environments requiring robustness to initial state.},

Extensive experiments on challenging Mujoco environments demonstrate HiT-MDP's efficiency and effectiveness: under widely used configurations, HiT-MDP achieves competitive, if not better, performance compared to the state-of-the-art baselines on all finite horizon and transfer learning environments. Moreover, HiT-MDP significantly outperforms all baselines on infinite horizon environments while exhibiting smaller variance, faster convergence, and better interpretability.

Domain generalization (DG) aims to close this gap, with existing DG methods mainly focusing on the loss function design. In this paper, we propose to explore an orthogonal direction, i.e., the design of the backbone architecture. It is motivated by an empirical finding that transformer-based models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) outperform CNN-based models employing state-of-the-art (SOTA) DG algorithms on multiple DG datasets. We develop a formal framework to characterize a network's robustness to distribution shifts by studying its architecture's alignment with the correlations in the dataset. This analysis guides us to propose a novel DG model built upon vision transformers, namely \emph{Generalizable Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE)}. Extensive experiments on DomainBed demonstrate that GMoE trained with ERM outperforms SOTA DG baselines by a large margin. Moreover, GMoE is complementary to existing DG methods and its performance is substantially improved when trained with DG algorithms.},

Applying these results along with new Rademacher complexity bounds for adversarial training near initialization, we prove that for general data distributions and perturbation sets, adversarial training on shallow networks with early stopping and an idealized optimal adversary is able to achieve optimal adversarial test error.

Our analysis is based on the observation that the GW problem satisfies the Luo-Tseng error bound condition, which relates to estimating the distance of a point to the critical point set of the GW problem based on the optimality residual. This observation allows us to provide an approximation bound for the distance between the fixed-point set of BAPG and the critical point set of GW. Moreover, under a mild technical assumption, we can show that BAPG converges to its fixed point set. The effectiveness of BAPG has been validated through comprehensive numerical experiments in graph alignment and partition tasks, where it outperforms existing methods in terms of both solution quality and wall-clock time.},

  title        = {Progressively Compressed Auto-Encoder for Self-supervised Representation Learning},
  abstract     = {As a typical self-supervised learning strategy, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) is driven by recovering all masked patches from visible ones. However, patches from the same image are highly correlated and it is redundant to reconstruct all the masked patches. We find that this redundancy is neglected by existing MIM based methods and causes non-negligible overheads in computation that do not necessarily benefit self-supervised representation. In this paper, we present a novel approach named PCAE, short for Progressively Compressed AutoEncoder, to address the redundant reconstruction issue by progressively compacting tokens and only retaining necessary information for forward propagation and reconstruction. In particular, we identify those redundant tokens in an image via a simple yet effective similarity metric between each token with the mean of the token sequence. Those redundant tokens that other ones can probably represent are progressively dropped accordingly during the forward propagation, and importantly, we only focus on reconstructing these retained tokens. As a result, we are able to achieve a better trade-off between performance and efficiency for pre-training. Besides, benefitting from the flexible strategy, PCAE can be also directly employed for downstream fine-tuning tasks and enable scalable deployment. Experiments show that PCAE achieves comparable performance to MAE with only 1/8 GPU days. The code is available at https://github.com/caddyless/PCAE/.},

  title        = {Statistical Theory of Differentially Private Marginal-based Data Synthesis Algorithms},
  abstract     = {Marginal-based methods achieve promising performance in the synthetic data competition hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). To deal with high-dimensional data, the distribution of synthetic data is represented by a probabilistic graphical model (e.g., a Bayesian network), while the raw data distribution is approximated by a collection of low-dimensional marginals. Differential privacy (DP) is guaranteed by introducing random noise to each low-dimensional marginal distribution. Despite its promising performance in practice, the statistical properties of marginal-based methods are rarely studied in the literature. In this paper, we study DP data synthesis algorithms based on Bayesian networks (BN) from a statistical perspective. We establish a rigorous accuracy guarantee for BN-based algorithms, where the errors are measured by the total variation (TV) distance or the $L^2$ distance. Related to downstream machine learning tasks, an upper bound for the utility error of the DP synthetic data is also derived. To complete the picture, we establish a lower bound for TV accuracy that holds for every $\epsilon$-DP synthetic data generator.},

  title        = {Population-size-Aware Policy Optimization for Mean-Field Games},
  abstract     = {In this work, we attempt to bridge the two fields of finite-agent and infinite-agent games, by studying how the optimal policies of agents evolve with the number of agents (population size) in mean-field games, an agent-centric perspective in contrast to the existing works focusing typically on the convergence of the empirical distribution of the population. To this end, the premise is to obtain the optimal policies of a set of finite-agent games with different population sizes. However, either deriving the closed-form solution for each game is theoretically intractable, training a distinct policy for each game is computationally intensive, or directly applying the policy trained in a game to other games is sub-optimal. We address these challenges through the Population-size-Aware Policy Optimization (PAPO). Our contributions are three-fold: First, to efficiently generate efficient policies for games with different population sizes, we propose PAPO, which unifies two natural options (augmentation and hypernetwork) and achieves significantly better performance. PAPO consists of three components: the population-size encoding which transforms the original value of population size to an equivalent encoding to avoid training collapse, a hypernetwork to generate a distinct policy for each game conditioned on the population size, and the population size as an additional input to the generated policy. Next, we construct a multi-task-based training procedure to efficiently train the neural networks of PAPO by sampling data from multiple games with different population sizes. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple environments show the significant superiority of PAPO over baselines, and the analysis of the evolution of the generated policies further deepens our understanding of the two fields of finite-agent and infinite-agent games.},

  abstract     = {Feature engineering is widely acknowledged to be pivotal in tabular data analysis and prediction. Automated feature engineering (AutoFE) emerged to automate this process managed by experienced data scientists and engineers conventionally. In this area, most — if not all — prior work adopted an identical framework from the neural architecture search (NAS) method. While feasible, we posit that the NAS framework very much contradicts the way how human experts cope with the data since the inherent Markov decision process (MDP) setup differs. We point out that its data-unobserved setup consequentially results in an incapability to generalize across different datasets as well as also high computational cost. This paper proposes a novel AutoFE framework Feature Set Data-Driven Search (FETCH), a pipeline mainly for feature generation and selection. FETCH is built on a brand-new data-driven MDP setup using the tabular dataset as the state fed into the policy network. Further, we posit that the crucial merit of FETCH is its transferability where the yielded policy network trained on a variety of datasets is indeed capable to enact feature engineering on unseen data, without requiring additional exploration. To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneer attempt to build a tabular data pre-training paradigm via AutoFE. Extensive experiments show that FETCH systematically surpasses the current state-of-the-art AutoFE methods and validates the transferability of AutoFE pre-training.},

A variety of techniques have been designed to steal a remote machine learning model with high accuracy and fidelity. However, how to extract a robust model with similar resilience against adversarial attacks is never investigated. This paper presents the first study toward this goal. We first analyze those existing extraction solutions either fail to maintain the model accuracy or model robustness or lead to the robust overfitting issue. Then we propose Boundary Entropy Searching Thief (BEST), a novel model extraction attack to achieve both accuracy and robustness extraction under restricted attack budgets. BEST generates a new kind of uncertain examples for querying and reconstructing the victim model. These samples have uniform confidence scores across different classes, which can perfectly balance the trade-off between model accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BEST outperforms existing attack methods over different datasets and model architectures under limited data. It can also effectively invalidate state-of-the-art extraction defenses.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks have shown excellent prospects in speech separation tasks. However, obtaining good results while keeping a low model complexity remains challenging in real-world applications. In this paper, we provide a bio-inspired efficient encoder-decoder architecture by mimicking the brain's top-down attention, called TDANet, with decreased model complexity without sacrificing performance. The top-down attention in TDANet is extracted by the global attention (GA) module and the cascaded local attention (LA) layers. The GA module takes multi-scale acoustic features as input to extract global attention signal, which then modulates features of different scales by direct top-down connections. The LA layers use features of adjacent layers as input to extract the local attention signal, which is used to modulate the lateral input in a top-down manner. On three benchmark datasets, TDANet consistently achieved competitive separation performance to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with higher efficiency. Specifically, TDANet's multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) are only 5% of Sepformer, one of the previous SOTA models, and CPU inference time is only 10% of Sepformer. In addition, a large-size version of TDANet obtained SOTA results on three datasets, with MACs still only 10% of Sepformer and the CPU inference time only 24% of Sepformer. Our study suggests that top-down attention can be a more efficient strategy for speech separation.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies a curious phenomenon that machine learning model with Transformer architectures have sparse activation maps. By activation map we refer to the intermediate output of the multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) after a ReLU activation function, and by 'sparse' we mean that on average very few entries (e.g., 3.0% for T5-Base and 6.3% for ViT-B16) are nonzero for each input to MLP. Moreover, larger Transformers with more layers and wider MLP hidden dimensions are sparser as measured by the percentage of nonzero entries. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that the emergence of sparsity is a prevalent phenomenon that occurs for both natural language processing and vision tasks, on both training and evaluation data, for Transformers of various configurations, at layers of all depth levels. We discuss how sparsity immediately implies a way to significantly reduce the FLOP count and improve efficiency for Transformers. Moreover, we demonstrate perhaps surprisingly that enforcing an even sparser activation via Top-k thresholding with a small k brings a collection of desired properties, namely less sensitivity to noisy training data, more robustness to input corruptions, and better calibration for their prediction confidence.},

  abstract     = {Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is widely used to automatically obtain the neural network with the best performance among a large number of candidate architectures. To reduce the search time, zero-shot NAS aims at designing training-free proxies that can predict the test performance of a given architecture. However, as shown recently, none of the zero-shot proxies proposed to date can actually work consistently better than a naive proxy, namely, the number of network parameters (#Params). To improve this state of affairs, as the main theoretical contribution, we first reveal how some specific gradient properties across different samples impact the convergence rate and generalization capacity of neural networks. Based on this theoretical analysis, we propose a new zero-shot proxy, ZiCo, the first proxy that works consistently better than #Params. We demonstrate that ZiCo works better than State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) proxies on several popular NAS-Benchmarks (NASBench101, NATSBench-SSS/TSS, TransNASBench-101) for multiple applications (e.g., image classification/reconstruction and pixel-level prediction). Finally, we demonstrate that the optimal architectures found via ZiCo are as competitive as the ones found by one-shot and multi-shot NAS methods, but with much less search time. For example, ZiCo-based NAS can find optimal architectures with 78.1%, 79.4%, and 80.4% test accuracy under inference budgets of 450M, 600M, and 1000M FLOPs, respectively, on ImageNet within 0.4 GPU days.},

  abstract     = {There has been a proliferation of artificial intelligence applications, where model training is key to promising high-quality services for these applications. However, the model training process is both time-intensive and energy-intensive, inevitably affecting the user's demand for application efficiency. Layer freezing, an efficient model training technique, has been proposed to improve training efficiency. Although existing layer freezing methods demonstrate the great potential to reduce model training costs, they still remain shortcomings such as lacking generalizability and compromised accuracy. For instance, existing layer freezing methods either require the freeze configurations to be manually defined before training, which does not apply to different networks, or use heuristic freezing criteria that is hard to guarantee decent accuracy in different scenarios. Therefore, there lacks a generic and smart layer freezing method that can automatically perform ''in-situation'' layer freezing for different networks during training processes. To this end, we propose a generic and efficient training framework (SmartFRZ). The core proposed technique in SmartFRZ is attention-guided layer freezing, which can automatically select the appropriate layers to freeze without compromising accuracy. Experimental results show that SmartFRZ effectively reduces the amount of computation in training and achieves significant training acceleration, and outperforms the state-of-the-art layer freezing approaches.},

When it comes to nonconvex minimax optimization, however, current convergence analyses of gradient descent ascent (GDA) combined with adaptive stepsizes require careful tuning of hyper-parameters and the knowledge of problem-dependent parameters. Such a discrepancy arises from the primal-dual nature of minimax problems and the necessity of delicate time-scale separation between the primal and dual updates in attaining convergence. In this work, we propose a single-loop adaptive GDA algorithm called TiAda for nonconvex minimax optimization that automatically adapts to the time-scale separation. Our algorithm is fully parameter-agnostic and can achieve near-optimal complexities simultaneously in deterministic and stochastic settings of nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax problems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further justified numerically for a number of machine learning applications.},

Currently, the doubly robust (DR) methods have been widely studied and demonstrate superior performance. However, in this paper, we show that DR methods are unstable and have unbounded bias, variance, and generalization bounds to extremely small propensities. Moreover, the fact that DR relies more on extrapolation will lead to suboptimal performance. To address the above limitations while retaining double robustness, we propose a stabilized doubly robust (StableDR) learning approach with a weaker reliance on extrapolation. Theoretical analysis shows that StableDR has bounded bias, variance, and generalization error bound simultaneously under inaccurate imputed errors and arbitrarily small propensities. In addition, we propose a novel learning approach for StableDR that updates the imputation, propensity, and prediction models cyclically, achieving more stable and accurate predictions.

Their adaptation to zero-shot image-conditioned text generation tasks has drawn increasing interest. Prior arts approach to zero-shot captioning by either utilizing the existing large language models (e.g., GPT-2) or pre-training the encoder-decoder network in an end-to-end manner. In this work, we propose a simple framework, named DeCap, for zero-shot captioning. We introduce a lightweight visual-aware language decoder. This decoder is both data-efficient and computation-efficient: 1) it only requires the text data for training, easing the burden on the collection of paired data. 2) it does not require end-to-end training. When trained with text-only data, the decoder takes the text embedding extracted from the off-the-shelf CLIP encoder as a prefix embedding. The modality gap issue is widely observed in multi-modal contrastive models that prevents us from directly taking the visual embedding as the prefix embedding. We propose a training-free mechanism to reduce the modality gap. We project the visual embedding into the CLIP text embedding space, while the projected embedding retains the information of the visual input. Taking the projected embedding as the prefix embedding, the decoder generates high-quality descriptions that match the visual input. The experiments show that DeCap outperforms other zero-shot captioning methods and unpaired captioning methods on the typical image captioning benchmarks, i.e., MSCOCO and NoCaps.},

Unfortunately, existing offline RL methods are often over-conservative, inevitably hurting generalization performance outside data distribution. In our study, one interesting observation is that deep Q functions approximate well inside the convex hull of training data. Inspired by this, we propose a new method, DOGE (Distance-sensitive Offline RL with better GEneralization). DOGE marries dataset geometry with deep function approximators in offline RL, and enables exploitation in generalizable OOD areas rather than strictly constraining policy within data distribution. Specifically, DOGE trains a state-conditioned distance function that can be readily plugged into standard actor-critic methods as a policy constraint. Simple yet elegant, our algorithm enjoys better generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods on D4RL benchmarks. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the superiority of our approach to existing methods that are solely based on data distribution or support constraints.

  abstract     = {Many real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL) require making decisions in continuous action environments. In particular, determining the optimal dose level plays a vital role in developing medical treatment regimes. One challenge in adapting existing RL algorithms to medical applications, however, is that the popular infinite support stochastic policies, e.g., Gaussian policy, may assign riskily high dosages and harm patients seriously. Hence, it is important to induce a policy class whose support only contains near-optimal actions, and shrink the action-searching area for effectiveness and reliability. To achieve this, we develop a novel quasi-optimal learning algorithm, which can be easily optimized in off-policy settings with guaranteed convergence under general function approximations. Theoretically, we analyze the consistency, sample complexity, adaptability, and convergence of the proposed algorithm. We evaluate our algorithm with comprehensive simulated experiments and a dose suggestion real application to Ohio Type 1 diabetes dataset.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge distillation has been shown to be a powerful model compression approach to facilitate the deployment of pre-trained language models in practice. This paper focuses on task-agnostic distillation. It produces a compact pre-trained model that can be easily fine-tuned on various tasks with small computational costs and memory footprints. Despite the practical benefits, task-agnostic distillation is challenging. Since the teacher model has a significantly larger capacity and stronger representation power than the student model, it is very difficult for the student to produce predictions that match the teacher's over a massive amount of open-domain training data. Such a large prediction discrepancy often diminishes the benefits of knowledge distillation. To address this challenge, we propose Homotopic Distillation (HomoDistil), a novel task-agnostic distillation approach equipped with iterative pruning. Specifically, we initialize the student model from the teacher model, and iteratively prune the student's neurons until the target width is reached. Such an approach maintains a small discrepancy between the teacher's and student's predictions throughout the distillation process, which ensures the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HomoDistil achieves significant improvements on existing baselines. Our codes will be released.},

  abstract     = {The promise of multimodal models for real-world applications has inspired research in visualizing and understanding their internal mechanics with the end goal of empowering stakeholders to visualize model behavior, perform model debugging, and promote trust in machine learning models. However, modern multimodal models are typically black-box neural networks, which makes it challenging to understand their internal mechanics. How can we visualize the internal modeling of multimodal interactions in these models? Our paper aims to fill this gap by proposing MultiViz, a method for analyzing the behavior of multimodal models by scaffolding the problem of interpretability into 4 stages: (1) unimodal importance: how each modality contributes towards downstream modeling and prediction, (2) cross-modal interactions: how different modalities relate with each other, (3) multimodal representations: how unimodal and cross-modal interactions are represented in decision-level features, and (4) multimodal prediction: how decision-level features are composed to make a prediction. MultiViz is designed to operate on diverse modalities, models, tasks, and research areas. Through experiments on 8 trained models across 6 real-world tasks, we show that the complementary stages in MultiViz together enable users to (1) simulate model predictions, (2) assign interpretable concepts to features, (3) perform error analysis on model misclassifications, and (4) use insights from error analysis to debug models. MultiViz is publicly available, will be regularly updated with new interpretation tools and metrics, and welcomes inputs from the community.},

Most existing convolutional backbones follow the representation-to-classification paradigm, where representations of the input are firstly generated by category-agnostic convolutional operations, and then fed into classifiers for specific perceptual tasks (e.g., classification and segmentation). In this paper, we deviate from this classic paradigm and propose to augment potential category memberships as contextual priors in the convolution for contextualized representation learning. Specifically, top-k likely classes from the preceding stage are encoded as a contextual prior vector. Based on this vector and the preceding features, offsets for spatial sampling locations and kernel weights are generated to modulate the convolution operations. The new convolutions can readily replace their plain counterparts in existing CNNs and can be easily trained end-to-end by standard back-propagation without additional supervision. The qualities of Contextual Convolutional Networks make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks and boost the state-of-the-art architecture ConvNeXt-Tiny by 1.8% on top-1 accuracy of ImageNet classification. The superiority of the proposed model reveals the potential of contextualized representation learning for vision tasks.},

We present MapTR, a structured end-to-end Transformer for efficient online vectorized HD map construction. We propose a unified permutation-equivalent modeling approach, i.e., modeling map element as a point set with a group of equivalent permutations, which accurately describes the shape of map element and stabilizes the learning process. We design a hierarchical query embedding scheme to flexibly encode structured map information and perform hierarchical bipartite matching for map element learning. MapTR achieves the best performance and efficiency with only camera input among existing vectorized map construction approaches on nuScenes dataset. In particular, MapTR-nano runs at real-time inference speed (25.1 FPS) on RTX 3090, 8× faster than the existing state-of-the-art camera-based method while achieving 5.0 higher mAP. Even compared with the existing state-of-the-art multi-modality method, MapTR-nano achieves 0.7 higher mAP and 8× faster inference speed, and MapTR-tiny achieves 13.5 higher mAP and 3× faster inference speed. Abundant qualitative results show that MapTR maintains stable and robust map construction quality in complex and various driving scenes. MapTR is of great application value in autonomous driving.

  abstract     = {Statistical inference under market equilibrium effects has attracted increasing attention recently. In this paper we focus on the specific case of linear Fisher markets. They have been widely use in fair resource allocation of food/blood donations and budget management in large-scale Internet ad auctions. In resource allocation, it is crucial to quantify the variability of the resource received by the agents (such as blood banks and food banks) in addition to fairness and efficiency properties of the systems. For ad auction markets, it is important to establish statistical properties of the platform's revenues in addition to their expected values. To this end, we propose a statistical framework based on the concept of infinite-dimensional Fisher markets. In our framework, we observe a market formed by a finite number of items sampled from an underlying distribution (the "observed market") and aim to infer several important equilibrium quantities of the underlying long-run market. These equilibrium quantities include individual utilities, social welfare, and pacing multipliers. Through the lens of sample average approximation (SSA), we derive a collection of statistical results and show that the observed market provides useful statistical information of the long-run market. In other words, the equilibrium quantities of the observed market converge to the true ones of the long-run market with strong statistical guarantees. These include consistency, finite sample bounds, asymptotics, and confidence. As an extension, we discuss revenue inference in quasilinear Fisher markets.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that Transformers can generalize well to 3D atomistic graphs and present Equiformer, a graph neural network leveraging the strength of Transformer architectures and incorporating SE(3)/E(3)-equivariant features based on irreducible representations (irreps). First, we propose a simple and effective architecture by only replacing original operations in Transformers with their equivariant counterparts and including tensor products. Using equivariant operations enables encoding equivariant information in channels of irreps features without complicating graph structures. With minimal modifications to Transformers, this architecture has already achieved strong empirical results. Second, we propose a novel attention mechanism called equivariant graph attention, which improves upon typical attention in Transformers through replacing dot product attention with multi-layer perceptron attention and including non-linear message passing. With these two innovations, Equiformer achieves competitive results to previous models on QM9, MD17 and OC20 datasets.},

Given the feature set, how to fully utilize the information from the feature set is an active topic in deep CTR model designs. There are several existing deep CTR works focusing on feature interactions, feature attentions, and so on. They attempt to capture high-order feature interactions to enhance the generalization ability of deep CTR models. However, these works either suffer from poor high-order feature interaction modeling using DNN or ignore the balance between generalization and memorization during the recommendation. To mitigate these problems, we propose an adaptive feature fusion framework called MaskFusion, to additionally capture the explicit interactions between the input feature and the existing deep part structure of deep CTR models dynamically, besides the common feature interactions proposed in existing works. MaskFusion is an instance-aware feature augmentation method, which makes deep CTR models more personalized by assigning each feature with an instance-adaptive mask and fusing each feature with each hidden state vector in the deep part structure. MaskFusion can also be integrated into any existing deep CTR models flexibly. MaskFusion achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all seven benchmarks deep CTR models with three public datasets.},

In this work, we provide a unified view of such algorithms from a purely control-theoretic perspective, and propose a new convergent algorithm.

Adopting {TBN} that employs test batch statistics mitigates the performance degradation caused by the domain shift. However, re-estimating normalization statistics using test data depends on impractical assumptions that a test batch should be large enough and be drawn from i.i.d. stream, and we observed that the previous methods with {TBN} show critical performance drop without the assumptions. In this paper, we identify that {CBN} and {TBN} are in a trade-off relationship and present a new test-time normalization ({TTN}) method that interpolates the statistics by adjusting the importance between {CBN} and {TBN} according to the domain-shift sensitivity of each {BN} layer. Our proposed {TTN} improves model robustness to shifted domains across a wide range of batch sizes and in various realistic evaluation scenarios. {TTN} is widely applicable to other test-time adaptation methods that rely on updating model parameters via backpropagation. We demonstrate that adopting {TTN} further improves their performance and achieves state-of-the-art performance in various standard benchmarks.},

Especially valuable are Laplacian eigenvectors, which capture useful structural information about graphs and other geometric objects. However, ambiguities arise when computing eigenvectors: for each eigenvector v, the sign flipped -v is also an eigenvector. More generally, higher dimensional eigenspaces contain infinitely many choices of basis eigenvectors. These ambiguities make it a challenge to process eigenvectors and eigenspaces in a consistent way. In this work we introduce {SignNet} and {BasisNet} -- new neural architectures that are invariant to all requisite symmetries and hence process collections of eigenspaces in a principled manner. Our networks are universal, i.e., they can approximate any continuous function of eigenvectors with the proper invariances. When used with Laplacian eigenvectors, our networks are provably more expressive than existing spectral methods on graphs; for instance, they subsume all spectral graph convolutions, certain spectral graph invariants, and previously proposed graph positional encodings as special cases. Experiments show that our networks significantly outperform existing baselines on molecular graph regression, learning expressive graph representations, and learning neural fields on triangle meshes.},

However, unsupervised models output representation vectors, the elements of which are not good candidates to explain because they lack semantic meaning. To bridge this gap, recent works defined a scalar explanation output: a dot product-based similarity in the representation space to the sample being explained (i.e., an explicand). Although this enabled explanations of unsupervised models, the interpretation of this approach can still be opaque because similarity to the explicand's representation may not be meaningful to humans. To address this, we propose contrastive corpus similarity, a novel and semantically meaningful scalar explanation output based on a reference corpus and a contrasting foil. We demonstrate that contrastive corpus similarity is compatible with many post-hoc feature attribution methods to generate {COntrastive COrpus Attributions} ({COCOA}) and quantitatively verify that features important to the corpus are identified. We showcase the utility of {COCOA} in two ways: (i) we draw insights by explaining augmentations of the same image in a contrastive learning setting ({SimCLR}); and (ii) we perform zero-shot object localization by explaining the similarity of image representations to jointly learned text representations ({CLIP}).},

This work is the first to quantify and evaluate compositional uncertainty for seq2seq graph parsing tasks. First, we propose a generic, probabilistically interpretable framework that allows correspondences between seq2seq output probability to structural probability on the graph. This framework serves as a powerful medium for quantifying a seq2seq model's compositional uncertainty on graph elements (i.e., nodes or edges). Second, to evaluate uncertainty quality in terms of calibration, we propose a novel metric called Compositional Expected Calibration Error ({CECE}) which can measure a model's calibration performance on compositional structures. Extensive experiments on {AMR} parsing and molecular graph generation demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in providing reliable and interpretable uncertainty estimates for seq2seq graph parsing.},

We provide a comprehensive analysis of the {MGEO} framework, including identifiability conditions, theoretical guarantees, and practical limitations. However, {MGEO} methods show critical limitations in realistic scenarios. To address this, we introduce {ROBOT} ({RObust Bilevel OpTimization}), which goes beyond the {MGEO} framework and enjoys strong theoretical properties including identifiability, consistency and finite-sample generalization guarantees, without requiring perfect posterior estimation or assuming the existence of anchor points. {ROBOT} is theoretically demonstrated to be more robust in cases where {MGEO} methods fail, and experimentally shows superior performance across multiple benchmarks.},

However, learning open-vocabulary object detection from language is challenging since image-text pairs do not contain fine-grained object-language alignments. Previous solutions rely on either expensive grounding annotations or distilling classification-oriented vision models. In this paper, we propose a novel open-vocabulary object detection framework directly learning from image-text pair data by formulating object-language alignment as a set matching problem between a set of image region features and a set of word embeddings, enabling training of an open-vocabulary object detector on image-text pairs in a much simple and effective way. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, {COCO} and {LVIS}, demonstrate superior performance over competing approaches on novel categories, achieving 32.0% m{AP} on {COCO} and 21.7% mask m{AP} on {LVIS}.},

In high-risk applications like healthcare, practitioners require fully calibrated probability predictions for decision-making. That is, conditioned on the prediction vector, every class' probability should be close to the predicted value. Most existing calibration methods either lack theoretical guarantees for producing calibrated outputs, reduce classification accuracy in the process, or only calibrate the predicted class. This paper proposes a new Kernel-based calibration method called {KCal}. Unlike existing calibration procedures, {KCal} does not operate directly on the logits or softmax outputs of the {DNN}. Instead, {KCal} learns a metric space on the penultimate-layer latent embedding and generates predictions using kernel density estimates on a calibration set. We analyze {KCal} theoretically, showing that it enjoys a provable full calibration guarantee. Through extensive experiments across a variety of datasets, we show that {KCal} consistently outperforms baselines as measured by the calibration error and by proper scoring rules like the Brier Score.},

  abstract     = {We consider fair graph representation learning via data augmentations. While this direction has been explored previously, existing methods invariably rely on certain assumptions on the properties of fair graph data in order to design fixed strategies on data augmentations. Nevertheless, the exact properties of fair graph data may vary significantly in different scenarios. Hence, heuristically designed augmentations may not always generate fair graph data in different application scenarios. In this work, we propose a method, known as {Graphair}, to learn fair representations based on automated graph data augmentations. Such fairness-aware augmentations are themselves learned from data. Our {Graphair} is designed to automatically discover fairness-aware augmentations from input graphs in order to circumvent sensitive information while preserving other useful information. Experimental results demonstrate that our {Graphair} consistently outperforms many baselines on multiple node classification datasets in terms of fairness-accuracy trade-off performance. In addition, results indicate that {Graphair} can automatically learn to generate fair graph data without prior knowledge on fairness-relevant graph properties.},

  abstract     = {Physical simulations that accurately model reality are crucial for many engineering disciplines such as mechanical engineering and robotic motion planning. In recent years, learned Graph Network Simulators produced accurate mesh-based simulations while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost of traditional simulators. As these predictors have to simulate complex physical systems from only an initial state, they exhibit a high error accumulation for long-term predictions. In this work, we integrate sensory information to ground Graph Network Simulators on real world observations. In particular, we predict the mesh state of deformable objects by utilizing point cloud data. The resulting model allows for accurate predictions over longer time horizons, even under uncertainties in the simulation, such as unknown material properties. Since point clouds are usually not available for every time step, especially in online settings, we employ an imputation-based model. The model can make use of such additional information only when provided, and resorts to a standard Graph Network Simulator, otherwise. We experimentally validate our approach on a suite of prediction tasks for mesh-based interactions between soft and rigid bodies. Our method results in utilization of additional point cloud information to accurately predict stable simulations where existing Graph Network Simulators fail.},

Specifically, we present the notion of Flow Matching (FM), a simulation-free approach for training CNFs based on regressing vector fields of fixed conditional probability paths. Flow Matching is compatible with a general family of Gaussian probability paths for transforming between noise and data samples---which subsumes existing diffusion paths as specific instances. Interestingly, we find that employing FM with diffusion paths results in a more robust and stable alternative for training diffusion models. Furthermore, Flow Matching opens the door to training CNFs with other, non-diffusion probability paths. An instance of particular interest is using Optimal Transport (OT) displacement interpolation to define the conditional probability paths.},

Recent work has shown that one can reconstruct the causal variables from temporal sequences of observations under the assumption that there are no instantaneous causal relations between them. In practical applications, however, our measurement or frame rate might be slower than many of the causal effects. This effectively creates "instantaneous" effects and invalidates previous identifiability results. To address this issue, we propose iCITRIS, a causal representation learning method that allows for instantaneous effects in intervened temporal sequences when intervention targets can be observed, e.g., as actions of an agent. iCITRIS identifies the potentially multidimensional causal variables from temporal observations, while simultaneously using a differentiable causal discovery method to learn their causal graph.},

Mechanistically, such recurrent communication is often indirect and mediated by local interneurons. In this work, we explore the computational benefits of mediating recurrent communication via interneurons compared with direct recurrent connections. To this end, we consider two mathematically tractable recurrent neural networks that statistically whiten their inputs -- one with direct recurrent connections and the other with interneurons that mediate recurrent communication. By analyzing the corresponding continuous synaptic dynamics and numerically simulating the networks, we show that the network with interneurons is more robust to initialization than the network with direct recurrent connections in the sense that the convergence time for the synaptic dynamics in the network with interneurons (resp. direct recurrent connections) scales logarithmically (resp. linearly) with the spectrum of their initialization. Our results suggest that interneurons are computationally useful for rapid adaptation to changing input statistics. Interestingly, the network with interneurons is an overparameterized solution of the whitening objective for the network with direct recurrent connections, so our results can be viewed as a recurrent neural network analogue of the implicit acceleration phenomenon observed in overparameterized feedforward linear networks.},

While there have been promising advances in designing neural networks to harness multimodal data, the enormous success of data augmentation currently remains limited to single-modality tasks like image classification. Indeed, it is particularly difficult to augment each modality while preserving the overall semantic structure of the data; for example, a caption may no longer be a good description of an image after standard augmentations have been applied, such as translation. Moreover, it is challenging to specify reasonable transformations that are not tailored to a particular modality. In this paper, we introduce LeMDA, Learning Multimodal Data Augmentation, an easy-to-use method that automatically learns to jointly augment multimodal data in feature space, with no constraints on the identities of the modalities or the relationship between modalities. We show that LeMDA can (1) profoundly improve the performance of multimodal deep learning architectures, (2) apply to combinations of modalities that have not been previously considered, and (3) achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of applications comprised of image, text, and tabular data.},

We exploit the differential geometric viewpoint to model distributional evolution as smooth curves on the manifold. We reparameterize families of curves on the manifold and design a convex optimization problem to find a unique curve that concisely approximates the distributional evolution for human interpretation. Extensive experiments on node classification, link prediction, and graph classification tasks with evolving graphs demonstrate the better sparsity, faithfulness, and intuitiveness of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods.},

We find that a low-depth Transformer can represent the computations of any finite-state automaton (thus, any bounded-memory algorithm), by hierarchically reparameterizing its recurrent dynamics. Our theoretical results characterize shortcut solutions, whereby a Transformer with o(T) layers can exactly replicate the computation of an automaton on an input sequence of length T.},

  abstract     = {Transformers have quickly shined in the computer vision world since the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs). The dominant role of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) seems to be challenged by increasingly effective transformer-based models. Very recently, a couple of advanced convolutional models strike back with large kernels motivated by the local-window attention mechanism, showing appealing performance and efficiency. While one of them, i.e. RepLKNet, impressively manages to scale the kernel size to 31x31 with improved performance, the performance starts to saturate as the kernel size continues growing, compared to the scaling trend of advanced ViTs such as Swin Transformer. In this paper, we explore the possibility of training extreme convolutions larger than 31x31 and test whether the performance gap can be eliminated by strategically enlarging convolutions. This study ends up with a recipe for applying extremely large kernels from the perspective of sparsity, which can smoothly scale up kernels to 61x61 with better performance. Built on this recipe, we propose Sparse Large Kernel Network (SLaK), a pure CNN architecture equipped with sparse factorized 51x51 kernels that can perform on par with or better than state-of-the-art hierarchical Transformers and modern ConvNet architectures like ConvNeXt and RepLKNet, on ImageNet classification as well as a wide range of downstream tasks including semantic segmentation on ADE20K, object detection on PASCAL VOC 2007, and object detection/segmentation on MS COCO.},

To address this issue, we propose a novel MAE-based pre-training paradigm, Mixture of Cluster-conditional Experts (MoCE), which can be trained once but provides customized pre-training models for diverse downstream tasks. Different from the mixture of experts (MoE), our MoCE trains each expert only with semantically relevant images by using cluster-conditional gates. Thus, each downstream task can be allocated to its customized model pre-trained with data most similar to the downstream data. Experiments on a collection of 11 downstream tasks show that MoCE outperforms the vanilla MAE by 2.45% on average.},

Previous scalable methods for generating meshes typically rely on sub-optimal post-processing, and they tend to produce overly-smooth or noisy surfaces without fine-grained geometric details. To overcome these shortcomings, we take advantage of the graph structure of meshes and use a simple yet very effective generative modeling method to generate 3D meshes. Specifically, we represent meshes with deformable tetrahedral grids, and then train a diffusion model on this direct parametrization.},

The idea of rectified flow is to learn the ODE to follow the straight paths connecting the points drawn from π₀ and π₁ as much as possible. This is achieved by solving a straightforward nonlinear least squares optimization problem, which can be easily scaled to large models without introducing extra parameters beyond standard supervised learning. The straight paths are special and preferred because they are the shortest paths between two points, and can be simulated exactly without time discretization and hence yield computationally efficient models. We show that the procedure of learning a rectified flow from data, called rectification, turns an arbitrary coupling of π₀ and π₁ to a new deterministic coupling with provably non-increasing convex transport costs. In addition, recursively applying rectification allows us to obtain a sequence of flows with increasingly straight paths, which can be simulated accurately with coarse time discretization in the inference phase.},

  abstract     = {Safe reinforcement learning (RL) trains a policy to maximize the task reward while satisfying safety constraints. While prior works focus on the performance optimality, we find that the optimal solutions of many safe RL problems are not robust and safe against carefully designed observational perturbations. We formally analyze the unique properties of designing effective observational adversarial attackers in the safe RL setting. We show that baseline adversarial attack techniques for standard RL tasks are not always effective for safe RL and propose two new approaches - one maximizes the cost and the other maximizes the reward. One interesting and counter-intuitive finding is that the maximum reward attack is strong, as it can both induce unsafe behaviors and make the attack stealthy by maintaining the reward. We further propose a robust training framework for safe RL and evaluate it via comprehensive experiments.},

Previous researches either adopt supervised learning techniques or induce simple and coarse scalar rewards from pixels, neglecting the dense information contained in the image demonstrations. In this work, we propose to measure the expertise of various local regions of image samples, or called patches, and recover multi-dimensional patch rewards accordingly. Patch reward is a more precise rewarding characterization that serves as fine-grained expertise measurement and visual explainability tool. Specifically, we present Adversarial Imitation Learning with Patch Rewards (PatchAIL), which employs a patch-based discriminator to measure the expertise of different local parts from given images and provide patch rewards.},

Existing methods mostly adopt a simple encoder-decoder structure to generate the transferred motion. However, the simple architecture is insufficient to capture detailed pose changes and subtle motion transfer. To achieve better motion transfer, we propose Human MotionFormer, a hierarchical ViT framework that leverages global and local perceptions to capture large and subtle motion matching, respectively. The framework consists of two ViT encoders to extract input features (i.e., a target motion image and a source human image) and a ViT decoder with several cascaded blocks for feature matching and motion transfer. Additionally, we propose a mutual learning loss to enable the co-supervision between warping and generation branches for better motion representations.},

Attention modules tend to underline not only the target object but also the common co-occurring context that the module thinks helpful in the training. The problem is rooted in the confounding effect of the context leading to incorrect causalities between objects and predictions, which is further exacerbated by visual attention. In this paper, to learn causal object features robust for contextual bias, we propose a novel attention module named Interventional Dual Attention (IDA) for visual recognition. Specifically, IDA adopts two attention layers with multiple sampling intervention, which compensates the attention against the confounder context. Note that our method is model-agnostic and thus can be implemented on various backbones. Extensive experiments show our model obtains significant improvements in classification and detection with lower computation.},

However, how to adequately capture the temporal and spatial relations of the brain during sleep remains a challenge. In particular, existing methods cannot adaptively infer spatial-temporal relations of the brain under different sleep stages. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian spatial-temporal relation inference neural network, named Bayesian spatial-temporal transformer (BSTT), for sleep staging. Our model is able to adaptively infer brain spatial-temporal relations during sleep for spatial-temporal feature modeling through a well-designed Bayesian relation inference component. Meanwhile, our model also includes a spatial transformer for extracting brain spatial features and a temporal transformer for capturing temporal features. Experiments show that our BSTT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on ISRUC and MASS datasets. In addition, the visual analysis shows that the spatial-temporal relations obtained by BSTT inference have certain interpretability for sleep staging.},

Despite recent impressive progress, existing deep GM methods often have obvious difficulty in handling outliers, which are ubiquitous in practice. We propose a deep reinforcement learning based approach RGM, whose sequential node matching scheme naturally fits the strategy for selective inlier matching against outliers. A revocable action framework is devised to improve the agent's flexibility against the complex constrained GM. Moreover, we propose a quadratic approximation technique to regularize the affinity score, in the presence of outliers. As such, the agent can finish inlier matching timely when the affinity score stops growing, for which otherwise an additional parameter i.e. the number of inliers is needed to avoid matching outliers. In this paper, we focus on learning the back-end solver under the most general form of GM: the Lawler's QAP, whose input is the affinity matrix. Especially, our approach can also boost existing GM methods that use such input. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate its performance regarding both accuracy and robustness.},

While state-of-the-art deep neural network methods for SIDP learn scene depth from images in a supervised setting, they often overlook the invaluable invariances and priors in the rigid scene space, such as the regularity of the scene. The main contribution of this paper is to reveal the benefit of classical and well-founded variational constraints in the neural network design for the SIDP task. We show that imposing first-order variational constraints in the scene space together with popular encoder-decoder-based network architecture design provides excellent results for the supervised SIDP task. The imposed first-order variational constraint makes the network aware of the depth gradient in the scene space, i.e., regularity. The VA-DepthNet at test time shows considerable improvements in depth prediction accuracy compared to the prior art and is accurate also at high-frequency regions in the scene space.},

  abstract     = {Feature distillation makes the student mimic the intermediate features of the teacher. Nearly all existing feature-distillation methods use L2 distance or its slight variants as the distance metric between teacher and student features. However, while L2 distance is isotropic w.r.t. all dimensions, the neural network's operation on different dimensions is usually anisotropic, i.e., perturbations with the same 2-norm but in different dimensions of intermediate features lead to changes in the final output with largely different magnitude. Considering this, we argue that the similarity between teacher and student features should not be measured merely based on their appearance (i.e., L2 distance), but should, more importantly, be measured by their difference in function, namely how later layers of the network will read, decode, and process them. Therefore, we propose Function-Consistent Feature Distillation (FCFD), which explicitly optimizes the functional similarity between teacher and student features. The core idea of FCFD is to make teacher and student features not only numerically similar, but more importantly produce similar outputs when fed to the later part of the same network. With FCFD, the student mimics the teacher more faithfully and learns more from the teacher. Extensive experiments on image classification and object detection demonstrate the superiority of FCFD to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Multivariate time series often faces the problem of missing value. Many time series imputation methods have been developed in the literature. However, these methods all rely on an entangled representation to model dynamics of time series, which may fail to fully exploit the multiple factors (e.g., periodic patterns) contained in the time series. Moreover, the entangled representation usually has no semantic meaning, and thus they often lack interpretability. In addition, many recent models are proposed to deal with the whole time series to capture cross-channel correlations and identify temporal dynamics, but they are not scalable to large-scale datasets. Different from existing approaches, we propose TIDER, a novel matrix factorization-based method with disentangled temporal representations that account for multiple factors, namely trend, seasonality, and local bias. The learned disentanglement makes the imputation process more reliable and offers explainability for imputation results. Moreover, TIDER is scalable to large datasets. Empirical results show that our method not only outperforms existing approaches by notable margins on three real-world datasets, but also scales well to large datasets on which existing deep learning based methods struggle.},

To tackle these issues, Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) empirically estimates constraints from expert demonstrations. As an emerging research topic, ICRL does not have common benchmarks, and previous works tested algorithms under hand-crafted environments with manually-generated expert demonstrations. In this paper, we construct an ICRL benchmark in the context of RL application domains, including robot control, and autonomous driving. For each environment, we design relevant constraints and train expert agents to generate demonstration data. Besides, unlike existing baselines that learn a deterministic constraint, we propose a variational ICRL method to model a posterior distribution of candidate constraints.},

Although ratio matching is a sound method to learn discrete EBMs, it suffers from expensive computation and excessive memory requirements, thereby resulting in difficulties in learning EBMs on high-dimensional data. Motivated by these limitations, in this study, we propose ratio matching with gradient-guided importance sampling (RMwGGIS). Particularly, we use the gradient of the energy function w.r.t. the discrete data space to approximately construct the provably optimal proposal distribution, which is subsequently used by importance sampling to efficiently estimate the original ratio matching objective. We perform experiments on density modeling over synthetic discrete data, graph generation, and training Ising models to evaluate our proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly alleviate the limitations of ratio matching, perform more effectively in practice, and scale to high-dimensional problems.},

In this paper, we present N-to-One Representation (NORM), a new two-stage knowledge distillation method, which relies on a simple Feature Transform (FT) module consisting of two linear layers. In view of preserving the intact information learnt by the teacher network, during training, our FT module is merely inserted after the last convolutional layer of the student network. The first linear layer projects the student representation to a feature space having N times feature channels than the teacher representation from the last convolutional layer, and the second linear layer contracts the expanded output back to the original feature space. By sequentially splitting the expanded student representation into N non-overlapping feature segments having the same number of feature channels as the teacher's, they can be readily forced to approximate the intact teacher representation simultaneously, formulating a novel many-to-one representation matching mechanism conditioned on a single teacher-student layer pair. After training, such an FT module will be naturally merged into the subsequent fully connected layer thanks to its linear property, introducing no extra parameters or architectural modifications to the student network at inference. Extensive experiments on different visual recognition benchmarks demonstrate the leading performance of our method.},

We demonstrate that this mechanism can explain many aspects of grokking: data size dependence, weight decay dependence, the emergence of representations, etc. We then demonstrate that grokking can happen not only for algorithmic datasets and toy teacher-student setups, but also for standard machine learning datasets. In particular, we induce grokking on tasks involving images, language and molecules, although the grokking signals are sometimes less dramatic.},

Unfortunately, quadratic regularization does not give direct control over the cardinality (number of nonzeros) of the transportation plan.

  abstract     = {GOGGLE is a generative model that learns a relational structure underlying tabular data to better model variable dependencies, to introduce regularization, and to incorporate prior knowledge. Unlike their counterparts in image and sequence domains, deep generative models for tabular data almost exclusively employ fully-connected layers, which encode weak inductive biases about relationships between inputs. Real-world data generating processes can often be represented using relational structures, which encode sparse, heterogeneous relationships between variables. Using real-world datasets, we provide empirical evidence that the proposed method is effective in generating realistic synthetic data and exploiting domain knowledge for downstream tasks.},

We present HECOGrid, a suite of multi-agent RL environments that facilitates empirical evaluation of different MARL approaches across different levels of coordination and environmental heterogeneity by providing quantitative control over coordination and heterogeneity levels. We propose a Centralized Training Decentralized Execution learning approach called Stateful Active Facilitator (SAF) that enables agents to work efficiently in high-coordination and high-heterogeneity environments through a differentiable and shared knowledge source used during training and dynamic selection from a shared pool of policies. Results show that SAF consistently outperforms baselines IPPO and MAPPO across different tasks and different heterogeneity and coordination levels.},

However, because diffusion processes are most naturally applied on the unconstrained Euclidean space, key challenges arise for developing diffusion based models for learning data on constrained and structured domains. In this work, we present a simple and unified framework that can be easily adopted to various types of domains, including product spaces of any type (be it bounded/unbounded, continuous/discrete, categorical/ordinal, or their mix). In our model, the diffusion process is driven by a drift force that is a sum of two terms: one singular force designed by Doob's h-transform that ensures all outcomes of the process belong to the desirable domain, and one non-singular neural force field that is trained to make sure the outcome follows the data distribution statistically. Experiments show that our methods perform superbly on generating tabular data, images, semantic segments and 3D point clouds.},

In this work, we report a previously unobserved phenomenon in Mixup training: on a number of standard datasets, the performance of Mixup-trained models starts to decay after training for a large number of epochs, giving rise to a U-shaped generalization curve. This behavior is further aggravated when the size of original dataset is reduced. To help understand such a behavior of Mixup, we show theoretically that Mixup training may introduce undesired data-dependent label noises to the synthesized data. Via analyzing a least-square regression problem with a random feature model, we explain why noisy labels may cause the U-shaped curve to occur: Mixup improves generalization through fitting the clean patterns at the early training stage, but as training progresses, Mixup becomes over-fitting to the noise in the synthetic data. Extensive experiments are performed on a variety of benchmark datasets, validating this explanation.},

By training solely on written text, current language models (LMs) miss the grounded experience of humans in the real-world—their failure to relate language to the physical world causes knowledge to be misrepresented and obvious mistakes in their reasoning. We present Mind's Eye, a paradigm to ground language model reasoning in the physical world. Given a physical reasoning question, we use a computational physics engine (DeepMind's MuJoCo) to simulate the possible outcomes, and then use the simulation results as part of the input, which enables language models to perform reasoning. Experiments on 39 tasks in a physics alignment benchmark demonstrate that Mind's Eye can improve reasoning ability by a large margin (27.9\% zero-shot, and 46.0\% few-shot absolute accuracy improvement on average). Smaller language models armed with Mind's Eye can obtain similar performance to models that are 100x larger. Finally, we confirm the robustness of Mind's Eye through ablation studies.},

  abstract     = {In real-world applications, deep learning models often run in non-stationary environments where the target data distribution continually shifts over time. There have been numerous domain adaptation (DA) methods in both online and offline modes to improve cross-domain adaptation ability. However, these DA methods typically only provide good performance after a long period of adaptation, and perform poorly on new domains before and during adaptation – in what we call the "Unfamiliar Period", especially when domain shifts happen suddenly and significantly. On the other hand, domain generalization (DG) methods have been proposed to improve the model generalization ability on unadapted domains. However, existing DG works are ineffective for continually changing domains due to severe catastrophic forgetting of learned knowledge. To overcome these limitations of DA and DG in handling the Unfamiliar Period during continual domain shift, we propose RaTP, a framework that focuses on improving models' target domain generalization (TDG) capability, while also achieving effective target domain adaptation (TDA) capability right after training on certain domains and forgetting alleviation (FA) capability on past domains. RaTP includes a training-free data augmentation module to prepare data for TDG, a novel pseudo-labeling mechanism to provide reliable supervision for TDA, and a prototype contrastive alignment algorithm to align different domains for achieving TDG, TDA and FA. Extensive experiments on Digits, PACS, and DomainNet demonstrate that RaTP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art works from Continual DA, Source-Free DA, Test-Time/Online DA, Single DG, Multiple DG and Unified DA\&DG in TDG, and achieves comparable TDA and FA capabilities.},

In this work, we focus on the data heterogeneity that affects the prediction of machine learning models, and firstly propose the usable predictive heterogeneity, which takes into account the model capacity and computational constraints. We prove that it can be reliably estimated from finite data with probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds. Additionally, we design a bi-level optimization algorithm to explore the usable predictive heterogeneity from data. Empirically, the explored heterogeneity provides insights for sub-population divisions in income prediction, crop yield prediction and image classification tasks, and leveraging such heterogeneity benefits the out-of-distribution generalization performance.},

To learn a unified embedding space for multi-modal retrieval, UniVL-DR proposes two techniques: 1) Universal embedding optimization strategy, which contrastively optimizes the embedding space using the modality-balanced hard negatives; 2) Image verbalization method, which bridges the modality gap between images and texts in the raw data space. UniVL-DR achieves the state-of-the-art on the multi-modal open-domain question answering benchmark, WebQA, and outperforms all retrieval models on the two subtasks, text-text retrieval and text-image retrieval. It demonstrates that universal multi-modal search is feasible to replace the divide-and-conquer pipeline with a united model and also benefits single/cross modality tasks.},

It has been shown that both cross-entropy loss and mean square error can provably lead to NC. We remove NC's key assumption on the feature dimension and the number of classes, and then present a generalized neural collapse (GNC) hypothesis that effectively subsumes the original NC. Inspired by how NC characterizes the training target of neural networks, we decouple GNC into two objectives: minimal intra-class variability and maximal inter-class separability. We then use hyperspherical uniformity (which characterizes the degree of uniformity on the unit hypersphere) as a unified framework to quantify these two objectives. Finally, we propose a general objective -- hyperspherical uniformity gap (HUG), which is defined by the difference between inter-class and intra-class hyperspherical uniformity. HUG not only provably converges to GNC, but also decouples GNC into two separate objectives. Unlike cross-entropy loss that couples intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, HUG enjoys more flexibility and serves as a good alternative loss function. Empirical results show that HUG works well in terms of generalization and robustness.},

To handle this issue, we propose the Arbitrary Virtual Try-On Network (AVTON) that is utilized for all-type clothes, which can synthesize realistic try-on images by preserving and trading off characteristics of the target clothes and the reference person. Our approach includes three modules: 1) Limbs Prediction Module, which is utilized for predicting the human body parts by preserving the characteristics of the reference person. This is especially good for handling cross-category try-on task (e.g., long sleeves ↔ short sleeves or long pants ↔ skirts, etc.), where the exposed arms or legs with the skin colors and details can be reasonably predicted. We improve the TPS based warping method with a compactly supported radial function (Wendland's Ψ-function) in the Improved Geometric Matching Module, which is designed to warp clothes according to the geometry of the target person. Additionally, the paper includes a Trade-Off Fusion Module, which is to tradeoff the characteristics of the warped clothes and the reference person. This module is to make the generated try-on images look more natural and realistic based on a fine-tune symmetry of the network structure.},

One key challenge is to scale PCs to model large and high-dimensional real-world datasets: we observe that as the number of parameters in PCs increases, their performance immediately plateaus. This phenomenon suggests that the existing optimizers fail to exploit the full expressive power of large PCs. We propose to overcome such bottleneck by latent variable distillation: we leverage the less tractable but more expressive deep generative models to provide extra supervision over the latent variables of PCs. Specifically, we extract information from Transformer-based generative models to assign values to latent variables of PCs, providing guidance to PC optimizers. Experiments on both image and language modeling benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet and WikiText-2) show that latent variable distillation substantially boosts the performance of large PCs compared to their counterparts without latent variable distillation. In particular, on the image modeling benchmarks, PCs achieve competitive performance against some of the widely-used deep generative models, including variational autoencoders and flow-based models, opening up new avenues for tractable generative modeling.},

To reduce the heavy annotations needed for supervised learning methods, we present a novel self-supervised strategy that solves this problem without any human labels. Our key idea is to factorize canonical shapes and articulated object poses from input articulated shapes through part-level equivariant shape analysis. Specifically, we first introduce the concept of part-level SE(3) equivariance and devise a network to learn features of such property. Then, through a carefully designed fine-grained pose-shape disentanglement strategy, we expect that canonical spaces to support pose estimation could be induced automatically. Thus, we could further predict articulated object poses as per-part rigid transformations describing how parts transform from their canonical part spaces to the camera space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both complete and partial point clouds from synthetic and real articulated object datasets.},

One mechanism that has been argued to be critical to language learning is the ability to infer the mental states of other agents in social environments, coined Theory of Mind (ToM) by Premack \& Woodruff (1978). Drawing inspiration from the modern operationalized versions of ToM implemented in Rabinowitz et al. (2018) and Zhu et al. (2021), we build language-learning agents equipped with ToM, and measure its effects on the learning process. We model ToM by giving the speaker agent an internal listener model that is trained alongside the speaker and used to rerank potential utterances. We experiment with varying task difficulty, hypothesizing that models will acquire more complex language to adapt to stronger environmental pressures. Our main findings show that training speakers with a highly weighted ToM listener component leads to performance gains in our image referential game setting, and that increasing task difficulty in the training process results in more fluent and precise utterances in evaluation, suggesting the potential utility of further incorporating ToM, as well as other insights from child language acquisition, into computational models of language acquisition.},

The differentiable CoIT leverages original samples with augmented samples and hasten the state encoder for a contrastive invariant embedding. We evaluate our approach on DeepMind Control Suite and Atari100K, and empirical results verify advances using CoIT, enabling it to outperform the new state-of-the-art on various tasks.},

In this work, we explicitly consider a situation where potential spurious correlations are present in the majority of training data. In contrast with existing approaches, which use the ERM model outputs to detect the samples without spurious correlations and either heuristically upweight or upsample those samples, we propose the logit correction (LC) loss, a simple yet effective improvement on the softmax cross-entropy loss, to correct the sample logit. We demonstrate that minimizing the LC loss is equivalent to maximizing the group-balanced accuracy, so the proposed LC could mitigate the negative impacts of spurious correlations. Our extensive experimental results further reveal that the proposed LC loss outperforms state-of-the-art solutions on multiple popular benchmarks by a large margin, an average 5.5\% absolute improvement, without access to spurious attribute labels.},

By quantizing each weight vector as the superposition of multiple subword vectors (in two's complement) with scaling factors (in Low-bit Floating-Point, LBFP), BSFP can effectively fit the distribution of weight vectors while maintaining high computation efficiency. We present a grid search-based MSE-optimal quantization flow and a scaled serial processing engine to complete the quantization pipeline and the infrastructure.

  abstract     = {By enabling agents to communicate, recent cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods have demonstrated better task performance and more coordinated behavior. Most existing approaches facilitate inter-agent communication by allowing agents to send messages to each other through free communication channels, i.e., cheap talk channels. Current methods require these channels to be constantly accessible and known to the agents a priori. In this work, we lift these requirements such that the agents must discover the cheap talk channels and learn how to use them. Hence, the problem has two main parts: cheap talk discovery (CTD) and cheap talk utilization (CTU). We introduce a novel conceptual framework for both parts and develop a new algorithm based on mutual information maximization that outperforms existing algorithms in CTD/CTU settings.},

  abstract     = {In Natural Language Processing (NLP), intelligent neuron models can be susceptible to textual Trojan attacks. Such attacks occur when Trojan models behave normally for standard inputs but generate malicious output for inputs that contain a specific trigger. Syntactic-structure triggers, which are invisible, are becoming more popular for Trojan attacks because they are difficult to detect and defend against. However, these types of attacks require a large corpus of training data to generate poisoned samples with the necessary syntactic structures for Trojan insertion. Obtaining such data can be difficult for attackers, and the process of generating syntactic poisoned triggers and inserting Trojans can be time-consuming. This paper proposes a solution called TrojText, which aims to determine whether invisible textual Trojan attacks can be performed more efficiently and cost-effectively without training data. The paper introduces the Representation-Logit Trojan Insertion (RLI) algorithm, uses smaller sampled test data instead of large training data to achieve the desired attack. Additionally, the paper introduces two additional techniques, namely the accumulated gradient ranking (AGR) and Trojan Weights Pruning (TWP), to reduce the number of tuned parameters and the attack overhead. The TrojText approach was evaluated on three datasets (AG's News, SST-2, and OLID) using three NLP models (BERT, XLNet, and DeBERTa). The experiments demonstrated that the TrojText approach achieved a 98.35\% classification accuracy for test sentences in the target class on the BERT model for the AG's News dataset.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning models are increasingly used in high-stakes decision-making systems. In such applications, a major concern is that these models sometimes discriminate against certain demographic groups such as individuals with certain race, gender, or age. Another major concern in these applications is the violation of the privacy of users. While fair learning algorithms have been developed to mitigate discrimination issues, these algorithms can still leak sensitive information, such as individuals' health or financial records. Utilizing the notion of differential privacy (DP), prior works aimed at developing learning algorithms that are both private and fair. However, existing algorithms for DP fair learning are either not guaranteed to converge or require full batch of data in each iteration of the algorithm to converge. In this paper, we provide the first stochastic differentially private algorithm for fair learning that is guaranteed to converge. Here, the term "stochastic" refers to the fact that our proposed algorithm converges even when minibatches of data are used at each iteration (i.e. stochastic optimization). Our framework is flexible enough to permit different fairness notions, including demographic parity and equalized odds. In addition, our algorithm can be applied to non-binary classification tasks with multiple (non-binary) sensitive attributes. As a byproduct of our convergence analysis, we provide the first utility guarantee for a DP algorithm for solving nonconvex-strongly concave min-max problems. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm consistently offers significant performance gains over the state-of-the-art baselines, and can be applied to larger scale problems with non-binary target/sensitive attributes.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies federated learning (FL) -- especially cross-silo FL -- with data from people who do not trust the server or other silos. In this setting, each silo (e.g. hospital) has data from different people (e.g. patients) and must maintain the privacy of each person's data (e.g. medical record), even if the server or other silos act as adversarial eavesdroppers. This requirement motivates the study of Inter-Silo Record-Level Differential Privacy (ISRL-DP), which requires silos' communications to satisfy record/item-level differential privacy (DP). Sitting between central and local DP, ISRL-DP makes the realistic assumption (in cross-silo FL) that people trust their own silo, but not the server or other silos. In this work, we provide tight (up to logarithms) upper and lower bounds for ISRL-DP FL with convex/strongly convex loss functions and homogeneous (i.i.d.) silo data. Remarkably, we show that similar bounds are attainable for smooth losses with arbitrary heterogeneous silo data distributions, via an accelerated ISRL-DP algorithm. We also provide tight upper and lower bounds for ISRL-DP federated empirical risk minimization, and use acceleration to attain the optimal bounds in fewer rounds of communication than the state-of-the-art. Finally, with a secure "shuffler" to anonymize silo messages (but without a trusted server), our algorithm attains the optimal central DP rates under more practical trust assumptions. Numerical experiments show favorable privacy-accuracy tradeoffs for our algorithm in classification and regression tasks.},

  abstract     = {Time series classification is an important problem in the real world. Due to its non-stationary property that the distribution changes over time, it remains challenging to build models for generalization to unseen distributions. In this paper, we propose to view time series classification from the distribution perspective. We argue that the temporal complexity of a time series dataset could attribute to unknown latent distributions that need characterize. To this end, we propose DIVERSIFY for out-of-distribution (OOD) representation learning on dynamic distributions of times series. DIVERSIFY takes an iterative process: it first obtains the 'worst-case' latent distribution scenario via adversarial training, then reduces the gap between these latent distributions. We then show that such an algorithm is theoretically supported. Extensive experiments are conducted on seven datasets with different OOD settings across gesture recognition, speech commands recognition, wearable stress and affect detection, and sensor-based human activity recognition, demonstrating that DIVERSIFY significantly outperforms other baselines and effectively characterizes the latent distributions by qualitative and quantitative analysis.},

There are two types of questions: free-text and multi-choice, and each problem is annotated with gold solutions to reveal the multi-step reasoning process. We utilize policy gradient to learn to select in-context examples from a small amount of training data and then construct the corresponding prompt for the test example. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the best baseline by 5.31\% on the accuracy metric and reduces the prediction variance significantly compared to random selection.},

Although procedural planning is a basic skill set for humans in daily life, it remains a challenge for large language models ({LLM}s) that lack a deep understanding of the cause-effect relations in procedures. Previous methods require manual exemplars to acquire procedural planning knowledge from {LLM}s in the zero-shot setting. However, such elicited pre-trained knowledge in {LLM}s induces spurious correlations between goals and steps, which impair the model generalization to unseen tasks. In contrast, this paper proposes a neuro-symbolic procedural {PLAN}ner ({PLAN}) that elicits procedural planning knowledge from the {LLM}s with commonsense-infused prompting. To mitigate spurious goal-step correlations, we use symbolic program executors on the latent procedural representations to formalize prompts from commonsense knowledge bases as a causal intervention toward the structural causal model. We construct commonsense-infused prompt from external knowledge to elicit procedural planning ability of the {LLM}s without training or exemplars.},

Despite the inherent {NP}-hard challenge for {CO}, heuristics, branch-and-bound, learning-based solvers are developed to tackle {CO} problems as accurately as possible given limited time budgets. However, a practical metric for the sensitivity of {CO} solvers remains largely unexplored. Existing theoretical metrics require the optimal solution which is infeasible, and the gradient-based adversarial attack metric from deep learning is not compatible with non-learning solvers that are usually non-differentiable. In this paper, we develop the first practically feasible robustness metric for general combinatorial optimization solvers. We develop a no worse optimal cost guarantee thus do not require optimal solutions, and we tackle the non-differentiable challenge by resorting to black-box adversarial attack methods. Extensive experiments are conducted on 14 unique combinations of solvers and {CO} problems, and we demonstrate that the performance of state-of-the-art solvers like {G}urobi can degenerate by over 20\% under the given time limit bound on the hard instances discovered by our robustness metric.},

We propose a new approach to learning arbitrary {B}regman divergences in a differentiable manner via input convex neural networks and show that it overcomes significant limitations of previous works. We also demonstrate that our method more faithfully learns divergences over a set of both new and previously studied tasks, including asymmetric regression, ranking, and clustering. Our tests further extend to known asymmetric, but non-{B}regman tasks, where our method still performs competitively despite misspecification, showing the general utility of our approach for asymmetric learning.},

To resolve this dilemma, we propose a simple remedy named {DYNACL} ({D}ynamic {A}dversarial {C}ontrastive {L}earning).

Our empirical study, however, suggests that mainstream uncertainty-based and diversity-based active learning policies are not effective when applied in the 3D detection task, as they fail to balance the trade-off between point cloud informativeness and box-level annotation costs. To overcome this limitation, we jointly investigate three novel criteria in our framework CRB for point cloud acquisition - label conciseness, feature representativeness and geometric balance, which hierarchically filters out the point clouds of redundant 3D bounding box labels, latent features and geometric characteristics (e.g., point cloud density) from the unlabeled sample pool and greedily selects informative ones with fewer objects to annotate. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed criteria align the marginal distributions of the selected subset and the prior distributions of the unseen test set, and minimizes the upper bound of the generalization error. To validate the effectiveness and applicability of CRB, we conduct extensive experiments on the two benchmark 3D object detection datasets of KITTI and Waymo and examine both one-stage (i.e., SECOND) and two-stage 3D detectors (i.e., PV-RCNN). Experiments evidence that the proposed approach outperforms existing active learning strategies and achieves fully supervised performance requiring 1\% and 8\% annotations of bounding boxes and point clouds, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Unlike vision and language data which usually has a unique format, molecules can naturally be characterized using different chemical formulations. One can view a molecule as a 2D graph or define it as a collection of atoms located in a 3D space. For molecular representation learning, most previous works designed neural networks only for a particular data format, making the learned models likely to fail for other data formats. We believe a general-purpose neural network model for chemistry should be able to handle molecular tasks across data modalities. To achieve this goal, in this work, we develop a novel Transformer-based Molecular model called Transformer-M, which can take molecular data of 2D or 3D formats as input and generate meaningful semantic representations. Using the standard Transformer as the backbone architecture, Transformer-M develops two separated channels to encode 2D and 3D structural information and incorporate them with the atom features in the network modules. When the input data is in a particular format, the corresponding channel will be activated, and the other will be disabled. By training on 2D and 3D molecular data with properly designed supervised signals, Transformer-M automatically learns to leverage knowledge from different data modalities and correctly capture the representations. We conducted extensive experiments for Transformer-M. All empirical results show that Transformer-M can simultaneously achieve strong performance on 2D and 3D tasks, suggesting its broad applicability.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of large datasets, offline reinforcement learning is a promising framework for learning good decision-making policies without the need to interact with the real environment. However, offline RL requires the dataset to be reward-annotated, which presents practical challenges when reward engineering is difficult or when obtaining reward annotations is labor-intensive. We introduce Optimal Transport Reward labeling (OTR), an algorithm that assigns rewards to offline trajectories using a few high-quality demonstrations. OTR's key idea is to use optimal transport to compute an optimal alignment between an unlabeled trajectory in the dataset and an expert demonstration to obtain a similarity measure that can be interpreted as a reward, which can then be used by an offline RL algorithm to learn the policy. OTR is easy to implement and computationally efficient. We demonstrate that OTR with one expert demonstration can consistently match the performance of offline RL with ground-truth rewards across various tasks and datasets.},

We argue that the core challenge of data augmentations lies in designing data transformations that preserve labels. This is relatively straightforward for images, but much more challenging for graphs. In this work, we propose GraphAug, a novel automated data augmentation method aiming at computing label-invariant augmentations for graph classification. Instead of using uniform transformations as in existing studies, GraphAug uses an automated augmentation model to avoid compromising critical label-related information of the graph, thereby producing label-invariant augmentations at most times. To ensure label-invariance, we develop a training method based on reinforcement learning to maximize an estimated label-invariance probability. Experiments show that GraphAug outperforms previous graph augmentation methods on various graph classification tasks.},

  abstract     = {Protein-protein interactions are crucial to many biological processes. We propose a new approach that predicts mutational effects on binding using the change in conformational flexibility of the protein-protein interface. Our approach, named Rotamer Density Estimator (RDE), employs a flow-based generative model to estimate the probability distribution of protein side-chain conformations and uses entropy to measure flexibility. When two proteins bind, the residues located at the interface tend to become less flexible due to the physical and geometric constraints imposed by the binding partner. A higher amount of entropy loss corresponds to a stronger binding affinity. By comparing the entropy losses of wild-type and mutated protein complexes, we can estimate the effect of mutations on binding affinity. RDE is trained solely on protein structures and does not require the supervision of experimental values of changes in binding affinities. The unsupervised representations extracted by RDE can be used for downstream neural network predictions with even greater accuracy. Experiments show that RDE outperforms empirical energy functions and other machine learning-based approaches.},

In this paper, we focus on the context of topic modeling and highlight a key advantage of self-supervised learning - when applied to data generated by topic models, self-supervised learning can be oblivious to the specific model, and hence is less susceptible to model misspecification. In particular, we prove that commonly used self-supervised objectives based on reconstruction or contrastive samples can both recover useful posterior information for general topic models. Empirically, we show that the same objectives can perform on par with posterior inference using the correct model, while outperforming posterior inference using misspecified models.},

Unfortunately, no architecture has been found for dealing with tabular data yet, for which tree ensemble methods (tree boosting, random forests) usually show the best predictive performances. In this work, we propose a new sparse initialization technique for (potentially deep) multilayer perceptrons: we first train a tree-based procedure to detect feature interactions and use the resulting information to initialize the network, which is subsequently trained via standard stochastic gradient strategies. Numerical experiments on several tabular data sets demonstrate the benefits of this method in terms of both generalization capacity and computation time, compared to default MLP initialization and existing complex deep learning solutions.},

In this work, we present a conversion plus fine-tuning two-step method for training SNN for text classification and propose a simple but effective way to encode pre-trained word embeddings as spike trains. We show empirically that after further fine-tuning with surrogate gradients, the converted SNNs achieve comparable results to their DNN counterparts across multiple datasets for both English and Chinese. We also demonstrate that such SNNs are more robust against adversarial attacks than DNNs.},

  abstract     = {Gradient inversion attacks have posed a serious threat to the privacy of federated learning. The attacks search for the optimal pair of input and label best matching the shared gradients and the search space of the attacks can be reduced by pre-restoring labels. Recently, label restoration technique allows for the extraction of labels from gradients analytically, but even the state-of-the-art remains limited to identify the presence of categories (i.e., the class-wise label restoration). This work considers the more real-world settings, where there are multiple instances of each class in a training batch. An analytic method is proposed to perform instance-wise batch label restoration from only the gradient of the final layer. On the basis of the approximate recovered class-wise embeddings and post-softmax probabilities, we establish linear equations of the gradients, probabilities and labels to derive the Number of Instances per class by the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse algorithm. We achieve over 99\% Label existence Accuracy and exceed 96\% Label number Accuracy in most cases on three image datasets and four classification models. The recovery is made feasible even with a batch size of 4096 and partially negative activations. Our method facilitates the existing gradient inversion attacks by exploiting the recovered labels, with an increase of 6-7 in PSNR on both MNIST and CIFAR100.},

Our approach anticipates changes in the underlying data generating process through a predictor-corrector term in the update rule. The key challenge is the estimation of the predictor-corrector term; a naive approach based on sample-average approximation may lead to non-convergence. We develop a general moving-average based method to estimate the predictor-corrector term and provide error bounds for the iterates, both in presence of pure and noisy access to queries from the relevant derivatives of the loss function.},

  abstract     = {This paper builds bridges between two families of probabilistic algorithms: (hierarchical) variational inference ({VI}), which is typically used to model distributions over continuous spaces, and generative flow networks ({GFlowNets}), which have been used for distributions over discrete structures such as graphs. We demonstrate that, in certain cases, {VI} algorithms are equivalent to special cases of {GFlowNets} in the sense of equality of expected gradients of their learning objectives. Notably, {GFlowNets}, which borrow ideas from reinforcement learning, are more amenable than {VI} to off-policy training without the cost of high gradient variance induced by importance sampling. We argue that this property of {GFlowNets} can provide advantages for capturing diversity in multimodal target distributions.},

However, this paper reveals a critical flaw in cascading ensembles: the robustness certifier used by cascading ensembles is unsound. When a cascading ensemble is certified as locally robust at an input x with respect to ε, there can be inputs x' in the ε-ball centered at x where the cascade's prediction differs, making the ensemble not locally robust. We develop a new attack against cascading ensembles showing that adversarial inputs exist for up to 88\% of samples where ensembles claim certified robustness, and accuracy can drop as low as 11\% under attack when the ensemble claims 97\% certified robust accuracy.},

However, imperceptible adversarial perturbations can significantly reduce {CLIP}'s performance on new tasks. This work identifies and explores the problem of adapting large-scale models for zero-shot adversarial robustness. We identify two key factors during model adaptation -- training losses and adaptation methods -- that affect the model's zero-shot adversarial robustness. We propose a text-guided contrastive adversarial training loss, which aligns the text embeddings and the adversarial visual features with contrastive learning on a small set of training data. We apply this training loss to two adaptation methods, model finetuning and visual prompt tuning. We find that visual prompt tuning is more effective in the absence of texts, while finetuning wins in the existence of text guidance. Overall, our approach significantly improves the zero-shot adversarial robustness over {CLIP}, seeing an average improvement of over 31 points over {ImageNet} and 15 zero-shot datasets.},

We show that machine embeddings of text descriptions can predict human similarity judgments better than models trained from images, audio and video. Our proposed language-based methods are significantly cheaper in the number of human judgments than classical methods, but still improve performance over the {DNN}-based methods.

We introduce a novel mechanism which modulates perception based on high level categorical expectations: Mid-Vision Feedback ({MVF}). {MVF} associates high-level contexts with linear transformations and when a context is expected, its associated linear transformation is applied over feature vectors in a mid level of a network. The result is that mid-level network representations are biased towards conformance with high level expectations, improving overall accuracy and contextual consistency. During training, mid-level feature vectors are biased through introduction of a loss term which increases the distance between feature vectors associated with different contexts. {MVF} is agnostic as to the source of contextual expectations, and can serve as a mechanism for top down integration of symbolic systems with deep vision architectures. We demonstrate {MVF}'s superior performance compared to post-hoc filtering and show improved results when using predicted context.},

However, without appropriate knowledge and exploration, skills may provide control only over a restricted area of the environment, limiting their applicability. Furthermore, it is unclear how to leverage the learned skill behaviors for adapting to downstream tasks in a data-efficient manner. We present Choreographer, a model-based agent that exploits its world model to learn and adapt skills in imagination. Our method decouples the exploration and skill learning processes, being able to discover skills in the latent state space of the model. During adaptation, the agent uses a meta-controller to evaluate and adapt the learned skills efficiently by deploying them in parallel in imagination. Choreographer is able to learn skills both from offline data, and by collecting data simultaneously with an exploration policy. The skills can be used to effectively adapt to downstream tasks, as we show in the URL benchmark, where we outperform previous approaches from both pixels and states inputs. The skills also explore the environment thoroughly, finding sparse rewards more frequently, as shown in goal-reaching tasks from the DMC Suite and Meta-World.},

One promising line of research uses neural networks to approximate counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) or its modern variants. DREAM, the only current CFR-based neural method that is model free and therefore scalable to very large games, trains a neural network on an estimated regret target that can have extremely high variance due to an importance sampling term inherited from Monte Carlo CFR (MCCFR). In this paper we propose an unbiased model-free method that does not require any importance sampling. Our method, ESCHER, is principled and is guaranteed to converge to an approximate Nash equilibrium with high probability. We show that the variance of the estimated regret of ESCHER is orders of magnitude lower than DREAM and other baselines. We then show that ESCHER outperforms the prior state of the art—DREAM and neural fictitious self play (NFSP)—on a number of games and the difference becomes dramatic as game size increases. In the very large game of dark chess, ESCHER is able to beat DREAM and NFSP in a head-to-head competition over 90\% of the time.},

We show that our algorithm is computationally more efficient compared to other barycenter-based distance methods, with the additional advantage that gradients used for backpropagation can be efficiently computed during the forward pass computation itself, leading to substantially faster model training. On a range of experiments designed to assess effectiveness at enforcing fairness, our method compares favorably with alternatives while achieving faster runtimes.},

The procedure gives no intermediate understanding of why a category is chosen, and furthermore provides no mechanism for adjusting the criteria used towards this decision.

In these settings, performing actions at each time step quickly accumulates costs leading to vastly suboptimal outcomes. Additionally, repeatedly acting produces wear and tear and ultimately, damage. Determining when to act is crucial for achieving successful outcomes and yet, the challenge of efficiently learning to behave optimally when actions incur minimally bounded costs remains unresolved. In this paper, we introduce a reinforcement learning ({RL}) framework named Learnable Impulse Control Reinforcement Algorithm ({LICRA}), for learning to optimally select both when to act and which actions to take when actions incur costs. At the core of {LICRA} is a nested structure that combines {RL} and a form of policy known as impulse control which learns to maximise objectives when actions incur costs. We prove that {LICRA}, which seamlessly adopts any {RL} method, converges to policies that optimally select when to perform actions and their optimal magnitudes. We then augment {LICRA} to handle problems in which the agent can perform at most k < ∞ actions and more generally, faces a budget constraint. We show {LICRA} learns the optimal value function and ensures budget constraints are satisfied almost surely. We demonstrate empirically {LICRA}'s superior performance against benchmark {RL} methods in {OpenAI} gym's Lunar Lander and in Highway environments and a variant of the Merton portfolio problem within finance.},

  abstract     = {The Neural Radiance Fields ({NeRF}) have been recently applied to reconstruct building-scale and even city-scale scenes. To model a large-scale scene efficiently, a dominant strategy is to employ a divide-and-conquer paradigm via performing scene decomposition, which decomposes a complex scene into parts that are further processed by different sub-networks. Existing large-scale {NeRFs} mainly use heuristic hand-crafted scene decomposition, with regular 3D-distance-based or physical-street-block-based schemes. Although achieving promising results, the hand-crafted schemes limit the capabilities of {NeRF} in large-scale scene modeling in several aspects. Manually designing a universal scene decomposition rule for different complex scenes is challenging, leading to adaptation issues for different scenarios. The decomposition procedure is not learnable, hindering the network from jointly optimizing the scene decomposition and the radiance fields in an end-to-end manner. The different sub-networks are typically optimized independently, and thus hand-crafted rules are required to composite them to achieve a better consistency. To tackle these issues, we propose {Switch-NeRF}, a novel end-to-end large-scale {NeRF} with learning-based scene decomposition. We design a gating network to dispatch 3D points to different {NeRF} sub-networks. The gating network can be optimized together with the {NeRF} sub-networks for different scene partitions, by a design with the Sparsely Gated Mixture of Experts ({MoE}). The outputs from different sub-networks can also be fused in a learnable way in the unified framework to effectively guarantee the consistency of the whole scene. Furthermore, the proposed {MoE}-based {Switch-NeRF} model is carefully implemented and optimized to achieve both high-fidelity scene reconstruction and efficient computation. Our method establishes clear state-of-the-art performances on several large-scale datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an applicable end-to-end sparse {NeRF} network with learning-based decomposition for large-scale scenes.},

In this paper we advocate for an alternate population-level training paradigm for referential games based on the idea of 'partitioning' the agents into sender-receiver pairs and limiting co-adaptation across pairs. We show that this results in optimizing a different objective at the population level, where agents maximize (1) their respective 'internal' communication accuracy and (2) some measure of alignment between agents. In experiments, we find that this leads to the emergence of languages that are significantly more compositional. Moreover, when agents are trained in populations that are not fully connected (ie. not all agent pairs interact at training time), this approach reduces multi-linguality and improves zero-shot communication with new agents (ie. agents are able to communicate successfully with other agents outside their training partners).},

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning agents are notoriously sample inefficient, which considerably limits their application to real-world problems. Recently, many model-based methods have been designed to address this issue, with learning in the imagination of a world model being one of the most prominent approaches. However, while virtually unlimited interaction with a simulated environment sounds appealing, the world model has to be accurate over extended periods of time. Motivated by the success of Transformers in sequence modeling tasks, we introduce {IRIS}, a data-efficient agent that learns in a world model composed of a discrete autoencoder and an autoregressive Transformer. With the equivalent of only two hours of gameplay in the Atari 100k benchmark, {IRIS} achieves a mean human normalized score of 1.046, and outperforms humans on 10 out of 26 games, setting a new state of the art for methods without lookahead search.},

To avoid these problems, we augment flows with annealed importance sampling ({AIS}) and minimize the mass-covering α-divergence with α=2, which minimizes importance weight variance. Our method, Flow {AIS} Bootstrap ({FAB}), uses {AIS} to generate samples in regions where the flow is a poor approximation of the target, facilitating the discovery of new modes.},

Many such algorithms utilize the framework of energy-based models ({EBMs}), in which all free variables in the model are optimized to minimize a global energy function. However, in the literature, these algorithms exist in isolation and no unified theory exists linking them together. Here, we provide a comprehensive theory of the conditions under which {EBMs} can approximate {BP}, which lets us unify many of the {BP} approximation results in the literature (namely, predictive coding, equilibrium propagation, and contrastive Hebbian learning) and demonstrate that their approximation to {BP} arises from a simple and general mathematical property of {EBMs} at free-phase equilibrium.},

  abstract     = {Predictive coding ({PC}) is an influential theory in computational neuroscience, which argues that the cortex forms unsupervised world models by implementing a hierarchical process of prediction error minimization. {PC} networks ({PCNs}) are trained in two phases. First, neural activities are updated to optimize the network's response to external stimuli. Second, synaptic weights are updated to consolidate this change in activity -- an algorithm called prospective configuration. While previous work has shown how in various limits, {PCNs} can be found to approximate backpropagation ({BP}), recent work has demonstrated that {PCNs} operating in this standard regime, which does not approximate {BP}, nevertheless obtain competitive training and generalization performance to {BP}-trained networks while outperforming them on tasks such as online, few-shot, and continual learning, where brains are known to excel. However, little is understood theoretically about the properties and dynamics of {PCNs} in this regime. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the properties of {PCNs} trained with prospective configuration. We first derive analytical results concerning the inference equilibrium for {PCNs} and a previously unknown close connection relationship to target propagation ({TP}). We prove the convergence of {PCNs} to critical points of the {BP} loss function, thus showing that deep {PCNs} can, in theory, achieve the same generalization performance as {BP}, while maintaining their unique advantages.},

Recent advances in representation learning give rise to distance-based {OOD} detection, where testing samples are detected as {OOD} if they are relatively far away from the centroids or prototypes of in-distribution ({ID}) classes. However, prior methods directly take off-the-shelf contrastive losses that suffice for classifying {ID} samples, but are not optimally designed when test inputs contain {OOD} samples. In this work, we propose {CIDER}, a novel representation learning framework that exploits hyperspherical embeddings for {OOD} detection. {CIDER} jointly optimizes two losses to promote strong {ID}-{OOD} separability: a dispersion loss that promotes large angular distances among different class prototypes, and a compactness loss that encourages samples to be close to their class prototypes. We analyze and establish the unexplored relationship between {OOD} detection performance and the embedding properties in the hyperspherical space, and demonstrate the importance of dispersion and compactness. {CIDER} establishes superior performance, outperforming the latest rival by 19.36\% in {FPR}95.},

However, the intensive use of complex non-linear functions within the Transformer architecture impairs its computing efficiency and complicates corresponding accelerator designs, because non-linear functions are generally computation-intensive and require special hardware support. In light of this, we propose {MA-BERT}, which allows matrix arithmetic-only operations in Transformer-based {NLP} models and achieves efficient inference with negligible accuracy loss. Specifically, we propose four correlated techniques that include approximating softmax with a two-layer neural network, replacing {GELU} with {ReLU}, fusing normalization layers with adjacent linear layers, and leveraging knowledge transfer from baseline models. {MA-BERT} completely eliminates the complex non-linear functions in {BERT} and achieves matrix arithmetic-only operation with trivial {ReLU}, which could benefit inference on both general computing units and accelerator designs for edge applications. Our experimental results show that {MA-BERT} achieves up to 27\% and 41\% reduction in inference time on {CPU} and {GPU}, respectively, with comparable accuracy on many downstream tasks compared to the baseline {BERT} models.},

However, most existing methods are designed and evaluated for the standard novelty detection setup, where the differences between normal and anomalous samples are obvious. In this paper, we focus on the challenging near-distribution novelty detection problem, where the differences between normal and anomalous samples are subtle, making detection significantly harder. We demonstrate that existing methods could experience up to 20\% decrease in their {AUCs} in the near-distribution setting. To address this challenge, we propose to exploit a score-based generative model to produce synthetic near-distribution anomalous data. Our model is then fine-tuned to distinguish such data from the normal samples. The effectiveness of our method for both near-distribution and standard novelty detection is assessed through extensive experiments on datasets in diverse applications such as medical images, object classification, and quality control. Our method significantly improves upon existing models, and consistently decreases the gap between the near-distribution and standard novelty detection {AUCs} by a considerable amount.},

While text-only adaptation was straightforward in traditional cascaded {ASR} systems with decoupled acoustic and language models, it becomes significantly more challenging with {RNN-Transducer} ({RNN-T}) models due to their tight integration of acoustic and language models and end-to-end training. Existing approaches for text-only adaptation of {RNN-Ts} either require significant network modifications or introduce high latency during decoding. The authors propose {TOLSTOI}, a new approach that imputes speech representations internal to a baseline {RNN-T} starting from text-only inputs and performs in-situ adaptation. Their imputation model is based on labeled data and trained parameters of the {ASR} model, which they show is more effective at controlling catastrophic forgetting compared to existing methods. They demonstrate effectiveness across three target domains and two {ASR} models of varying complexity, achieving up to 35\% relative reduction in word error rate with text-only adaptation while minimizing forgetting compared to existing approaches.},

Each partition is associated with and optimized only on specific data shards. Combining these partitions into subnetworks allows us to define the ``out-of-training-sample'' loss of a subnetwork, i.e., the loss on data shards unseen by the subnetwork, as the objective for hyperparameter optimization.},

We propose {RoPAWS}, a robust extension of {PAWS} that can work with real-world unlabeled data. We first reinterpret {PAWS} as a generative classifier that models densities using kernel density estimation. From this probabilistic perspective, we calibrate its prediction based on the densities of labeled and unlabeled data, which leads to a simple closed-form solution from the Bayes' rule.

Recent work proposes a simple, global, finite-sample stability metric: the minimum number of samples that need to be removed so that rerunning the analysis overturns the conclusion, specifically meaning that the sign of a particular coefficient of the estimated regressor changes. The authors develop provable and efficient algorithms for estimating stability of {OLS} to dropping samples in the low-dimensional regime. They show that stability can be efficiently certified in the low-dimensional regime: when the number of covariates is a constant but the number of samples is large, there are polynomial-time algorithms for estimating (a fractional version of) stability, with provable approximation guarantees. Applying their algorithms to the Boston Housing dataset, they exhibit regression analyses where their estimator outperforms the greedy heuristic, and can successfully certify stability even in the regime where a constant fraction of the samples are dropped.},

Here, we investigated the extent to which a general-purpose mechanism for processing visual scenes in terms of objects might help promote abstract visual reasoning. We found that a simple model, consisting only of an object-centric encoder and a transformer reasoning module, achieved state-of-the-art results on both of two challenging {RPM-like} benchmarks ({PGM} and {I-RAVEN}), as well as a novel benchmark with greater visual complexity ({CLEVR-Matrices}). These results suggest that an inductive bias for object-centric processing may be a key component of abstract visual reasoning, obviating the need for problem-specific inductive biases.},

  abstract     = {Neural networks embed the geometric structure of a data manifold lying in a high-dimensional space into latent representations. Ideally, the distribution of the data points in the latent space should depend only on the task, the data, the loss, and other architecture-specific constraints. However, factors such as the random weights initialization, training hyperparameters, or other sources of randomness in the training phase may induce incoherent latent spaces that hinder any form of reuse. Nevertheless, we empirically observe that, under the same data and modeling choices, the angles between the encodings within distinct latent spaces do not change. In this work, we propose the latent similarity between each sample and a fixed set of anchors as an alternative data representation, demonstrating that it can enforce the desired invariances without any additional training. We extensively validate the generalization capability of our approach on different datasets, spanning various modalities (images, text, graphs), tasks (e.g., classification, reconstruction) and architectures (e.g., CNNs, GCNs, transformers).},

In this approach, which we term MDL-control (MDL-C), the agent learns the common structure among the tasks with which it is faced and then distills it into a simpler representation which facilitates faster convergence and generalization to new tasks. In doing so, MDL-C naturally balances adaptation to each task with epistemic uncertainty about the task distribution. We motivate MDL-C via formal connections between the MDL principle and Bayesian inference, derive theoretical performance guarantees, and demonstrate MDL-C's empirical effectiveness on both discrete and high-dimensional continuous control tasks.},

  abstract     = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs), trained on a large-scale image dataset, can be a good approximator of the natural image manifold. GAN-inversion, using a pre-trained generator as a deep generative prior, is a promising tool for image restoration under corruptions. However, the performance of GAN-inversion can be limited by a lack of robustness to unknown gross corruptions, i.e., the restored image might easily deviate from the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a Robust GAN-inversion (RGI) method with a provable robustness guarantee to achieve image restoration under unknown gross corruptions, where a small fraction of pixels are completely corrupted. Under mild assumptions, we show that the restored image and the identified corrupted region mask converge asymptotically to the ground truth. Moreover, we extend RGI to Relaxed-RGI (R-RGI) for generator fine-tuning to mitigate the gap between the GAN learned manifold and the true image manifold while avoiding trivial overfitting to the corrupted input image, which further improves the image restoration and corrupted region mask identification performance. The proposed RGI/R-RGI method unifies two important applications with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance: (i) mask-free semantic inpainting, where the corruptions are unknown missing regions, the restored background can be used to restore the missing content; (ii) unsupervised pixel-wise anomaly detection, where the corruptions are unknown anomalous regions, the retrieved mask can be used as the anomalous region's segmentation mask.},

  abstract     = {Differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) is a popular method for neural architecture search (NAS), which performs cell-search and utilizes continuous relaxation to improve the search efficiency via gradient-based optimization. The main shortcoming of DARTS is performance collapse, where the discovered architecture suffers from a pattern of declining quality during search. Performance collapse has become an important topic of research, with many methods trying to solve the issue through either regularization or fundamental changes to DARTS. In this paper, we provide a thorough and novel theoretical and empirical analysis on DARTS and its point of convergence. We show that DARTS suffers from a specific structural flaw due to its weight-sharing framework that limits the convergence of DARTS to saturation points of the softmax function. This point of convergence gives an unfair advantage to layers closer to the output in choosing the optimal architecture, causing performance collapse. We then propose two new regularization terms that aim to prevent performance collapse by harmonizing operation selection via aligning gradients of layers. Experimental results on six different search spaces and three different datasets show that our method ($\Lambda$-DARTS) does indeed prevent performance collapse, providing justification for our theoretical analysis and the proposed remedy.},

Common approaches to interpretable machine learning constrain interactions between features of the input, sacrificing model complexity in order to render more comprehensible the effects of those features on the model's output. We approach interpretability from a new angle: constrain the information about the features without restricting the complexity of the model. We use the Distributed Information Bottleneck to optimally compress each feature so as to maximally preserve information about the output. The learned information allocation, by feature and by feature value, provides rich opportunities for interpretation, particularly in problems with many features and complex feature interactions. The central object of analysis is not a single trained model, but rather a spectrum of models serving as approximations that leverage variable amounts of information about the inputs.},

We observe faster decay of the Hermite coefficients leads to faster decay in the NTK coefficients and explore the role of depth. Using this series, first we relate the effective rank of the NTK to the effective rank of the input-data Gram. Second, for data drawn uniformly on the sphere we study the eigenvalues of the NTK, analyzing the impact of the choice of activation function. Finally, for generic data and activation functions with sufficiently fast Hermite coefficient decay, we derive an asymptotic upper bound on the spectrum of the NTK.},

  abstract     = {Today's computer vision models achieve human or near-human level performance across a wide variety of vision tasks. However, their architectures, data, and learning algorithms differ in numerous ways from those that give rise to human vision. In this paper, we investigate the factors that affect the alignment between the representations learned by neural networks and human mental representations inferred from behavioral responses. We find that model scale and architecture have essentially no effect on the alignment with human behavioral responses, whereas the training dataset and objective function both have a much larger impact. These findings are consistent across three datasets of human similarity judgments collected using two different tasks. Linear transformations of neural network representations learned from behavioral responses from one dataset substantially improve alignment with human similarity judgments on the other two datasets. In addition, we find that some human concepts such as food and animals are well-represented by neural networks whereas others such as royal or sports-related objects are not. Overall, although models trained on larger, more diverse datasets achieve better alignment with humans than models trained on ImageNet alone, our results indicate that scaling alone is unlikely to be sufficient to train neural networks with conceptual representations that match those used by humans.},

  abstract     = {We study the type of solutions to which stochastic gradient descent converges when used to train a single hidden-layer multivariate ReLU network with the quadratic loss. Our results are based on a dynamical stability analysis. In the univariate case, it was shown that linearly stable minima correspond to network functions (predictors), whose second derivative has a bounded weighted L¹ norm. Notably, the bound gets smaller as the step size increases, implying that training with a large step size leads to 'smoother' predictors. We generalize this result to the multivariate case, showing that a similar result applies to the Laplacian of the predictor. We demonstrate the tightness of our bound on the MNIST dataset, and show that it accurately captures the behavior of the solutions as a function of the step size. Additionally, we prove a depth separation result on the approximation power of ReLU networks corresponding to stable minima of the loss. Specifically, although shallow ReLU networks are universal approximators, we prove that stable shallow networks are not. There is a function that cannot be well-approximated by stable single hidden-layer ReLU networks trained with a non-vanishing step size, while the same function can be realized as a stable two hidden-layer ReLU network. Finally, we prove that if a function is sufficiently smooth (in a Sobolev sense) then it can be approximated arbitrarily well using shallow ReLU networks that correspond to stable solutions of gradient descent.},

Existing methods are trying to communicate visual concepts as prompts to frozen language models, but rely on hand-engineered task induction to reduce the hypothesis space. To make the whole process learnable, we introduce a multimodal meta-learning approach. Specifically, our approach decomposes the training of the model into a set of related multimodal few-shot tasks. We define a meta-mapper network, acting as a meta-learner, to efficiently bridge frozen large-scale vision and language models and leverage their already learned capacity. By updating the learnable parameters only of the meta-mapper, it learns to accrue shared meta-knowledge among these tasks. Thus, it can rapidly adapt to newly presented samples with only a few gradient updates. Importantly, it induces the task in a completely data-driven manner, with no need for a hand-engineered task induction. We evaluate our approach on recently proposed multimodal few-shot benchmarks, measuring how rapidly the model can bind novel visual concepts to words and answer visual questions by observing only a limited set of labeled examples. The experimental results show that our meta-learning approach outperforms the baseline across multiple datasets and various training settings while being computationally more efficient.},

Instead of likelihood-based objectives, GWAE models minimize the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) metric between the trainable prior and given data distributions. The GW metric yields the objective directly aiming at representation learning, and the variational autoencoding model provides a stable way of stochastic training using autoencoding. The GW metric measures the distance structure-oriented discrepancy between distributions even with different dimensionalities, providing a direct measure for representation learning without the need for ad-hoc modifications to the likelihood-based training process.},

However, as models struggle to predict object interactions and track the objects accurately, especially for unseen configurations, using object-centric representations in downstream tasks is still a challenge. This paper proposes STEDIE, a new model that disentangles object representations, based on interactions, into interaction-relevant relational features and interaction-irrelevant global features. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed model factorizes global features, unaffected by interactions from relational features that are necessary to predict outcome of interactions. We also show that STEDIE achieves better performance in planning tasks and understanding causal relationships. In both tasks, our model not only achieves better performance in terms of reconstruction ability but also utilizes the disentangled representations to solve the tasks in a structured manner.},

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for few-shot semi-supervised tabular learning, coined Self-generated Tasks from UNlabeled Tables (STUNT). Our key idea is to self-generate diverse few-shot tasks by treating randomly chosen columns as a target label. We then employ a meta-learning scheme to learn generalizable knowledge with the constructed tasks. Moreover, we introduce an unsupervised validation scheme for hyperparameter search (and early stopping) by generating a pseudo-validation set using STUNT from unlabeled data. Our experimental results demonstrate that our simple framework brings significant performance gain under various tabular few-shot learning benchmarks, compared to prior semi- and self-supervised baselines.},

One approach to understanding emergence is to find continuous progress measures that underlie the seemingly discontinuous qualitative changes. We argue that progress measures can be found via mechanistic interpretability: reverse-engineering learned behaviors into their individual components. As a case study, we investigate the recently-discovered phenomenon of "grokking" exhibited by small transformers trained on modular addition tasks. We fully reverse engineer the algorithm learned by these networks, which uses discrete Fourier transforms and trigonometric identities to convert addition to rotation about a circle. We confirm the algorithm by analyzing the activations and weights and by performing ablations in Fourier space. Based on this understanding, we define progress measures that allow us to study the dynamics of training and split training into three continuous phases: memorization, circuit formation, and cleanup. Our results show that grokking, rather than being a sudden shift, arises from the gradual amplification of structured mechanisms encoded in the weights, followed by the later removal of memorizing components.},

We then provide a formalization to abstract "coupled connections" and use it to derive a data-free way to measure the importance of coupled neurons in a network. To facilitate the development of algorithms to prune CCs, we define Data Flow Couplings (DFCs) to enumerate the layers that constitute coupled connections and the associated transformation. We thus propose the Backwards Graph-based Saliency Computation (BGSC) algorithm, a data-free method that computes saliencies by estimating an upper bound to the reconstruction error of intermediate layers; we call this pruning strategy Data Flow driven Pruning of Coupled channels (DFPC). Since we pruned coupled channels, we achieve up to 1.66x improvements in inference time for ResNet-101 trained on CIFAR-10 with a 5% accuracy drop without fine-tuning. With access to the ImageNet training set, we achieve significant improvements over the data-free method and see an improvement of at least 47.1% in speedup for a 2.3% accuracy drop for ResNet-50 against our baselines.},

  abstract     = {The transferability of adversarial perturbations between image models has been extensively studied. In this case, an attack is generated from a known surrogate (e.g., the ImageNet trained model) and transferred to change the decision of an unknown (black-box) model trained on an image dataset. However, attacks generated from image models do not capture the dynamic nature of a moving object or a changing scene due to a lack of temporal cues within image models. This leads to reduced transferability of adversarial attacks from representation-enriched image models such as Supervised Vision Transformers (ViTs), Self-supervised ViTs (e.g., DINO), and Vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to black-box video models. In this work, we induce dynamic cues within the image models without sacrificing their original performance on images. To this end, we optimize temporal prompts through frozen image models to capture motion dynamics. The temporal prompts are the result of a learnable transformation that allows optimizing for temporal gradients during an adversarial attack to fool the motion dynamics. We introduce spatial (image) and temporal (video) cues within the same source model through task-specific prompts. Attacking such prompts maximizes the adversarial transferability from image-to-video and image-to-image models using the attacks designed for image models. An iterative attack launched from image model DeiT-B with temporal prompts reduces generalization (top-1% accuracy) of a video model by 35% on Kinetics-400. Additionally, our approach also improves adversarial transferability to image models by 9% on ImageNet w.r.t the current state-of-the-art approach.},

We develop CSP for compositional zero-shot learning, the task of predicting unseen attribute-object compositions (e.g., old cat and young tiger). VLMs have a flexible text encoder that can represent arbitrary classes as natural language prompts but they often underperform task-specific architectures on the compositional zero-shot benchmark datasets. CSP treats the attributes and objects that define classes as learnable tokens of vocabulary. During training, the vocabulary is tuned to recognize classes that compose tokens in multiple ways (e.g., old cat and white cat). At test time, we recompose the learned attribute-object vocabulary in new combinations to recognize novel classes. We show that CSP outperforms the CLIP on benchmark datasets by an average of 10.9 percentage points on AUC. CSP also outperforms CoOp, a soft prompting method that fine-tunes the prefix context tokens, by an average of 5.8 percentage points on AUC. We perform additional experiments to show that CSP improves generalization to higher-order attribute-attribute-object compositions (e.g., old white cat) and combinations of pretrained attributes and fine-tuned objects.},

At inference time, the model finds an optimal linear combination of the functions in the learned family by solving a PDE-constrained optimization problem.

However, they fare poorly when evaluated on out-of-support test points. In this work, we tackle the problem of developing machine learning systems that retain the power of overparameterized function approximators while enabling extrapolation to out-of-support test points when possible. This is accomplished by noting that under certain conditions, a "transductive" reparameterization can convert an out-of-support extrapolation problem into a problem of within-support combinatorial generalization. We propose a simple strategy based on bilinear embeddings to enable this type of combinatorial generalization, thereby addressing the out-of-support extrapolation problem under certain conditions. We instantiate a simple, practical algorithm applicable to various supervised learning and imitation learning tasks. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling extrapolation while maintaining competitive performance on standard generalization tasks.},

A substantial amount of attention has been dedicated as a consequence to the description of scaling laws, although mostly for supervised learning and only to a reduced extent for reinforcement learning frameworks. In this paper we present an extensive study of performance scaling for a cornerstone reinforcement learning algorithm, AlphaZero. On the basis of a relationship between Elo rating, playing strength and power-law scaling, we train AlphaZero agents on the games Connect Four and Pentago and analyze their performance. We find that player strength scales as a power law in neural network parameter count when not bottlenecked by available compute, and as a power of compute when training optimally sized agents. We observe nearly identical scaling exponents for both games. Combining the two observed scaling laws we obtain a power law relating optimal size to compute similar to the ones observed for language models, and we find that the predicted scaling of optimal neural network size fits our data for both games. This scaling law implies that previously published state-of-the-art game-playing models are significantly smaller than their optimal size, given the respective compute budgets.},

The update to the actor involves a log-likelihood update weighted by the action-values, with the addition of entropy regularization for soft variants. In this work, we explore an alternative update for the actor, based on an extension of the cross entropy method (CEM) to condition on inputs (states). The idea is to start with a broader policy and slowly concentrate around maximal actions, using a maximum likelihood update towards actions in the top percentile per state. The speed of this concentration is controlled by a proposal policy, that concentrates at a slower rate than the actor. We first provide a policy improvement result in an idealized setting, and then prove that our conditional CEM (CCEM) strategy tracks a CEM update per state, even with changing action-values. We show empirically that our Greedy AC algorithm, that uses CCEM for the actor update, performs better than Soft Actor-Critic and is much less sensitive to entropy-regularization.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel algorithm for offline reinforcement learning called Value Iteration with Perturbed Rewards (VIPeR), which amalgamates the pessimism principle with random perturbations of the value function. Most current offline RL algorithms explicitly construct statistical confidence regions to obtain pessimism via lower confidence bounds (LCB), which cannot easily scale to complex problems where a neural network is used to estimate the value functions. Instead, VIPeR implicitly obtains pessimism by simply perturbing the offline data multiple times with carefully-designed i.i.d. Gaussian noises to learn an ensemble of estimated state-action value functions and acting greedily with respect to the minimum of the ensemble. The estimated state-action values are obtained by fitting a parametric model (e.g., neural networks) to the perturbed datasets using gradient descent. We also propose a novel data-splitting technique that helps remove a factor involving the log of the covering number in our bound. We prove that VIPeR yields a provable uncertainty quantifier with overparameterized neural networks and enjoys a bound on sub-optimality of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa H^{5/2} \tilde{d} /\sqrt{K})$, where $\tilde{d}$ is the effective dimension, $H$ is the horizon length and $\kappa$ measures the distributional shift. We corroborate the statistical and computational efficiency of VIPeR with an empirical evaluation on a wide set of synthetic and real-world datasets. To the best of our knowledge, VIPeR is the first algorithm for offline RL that is provably efficient for general Markov decision processes (MDPs) with neural network function approximation.},

  abstract     = {A recourse action aims to explain a particular algorithmic decision by showing one specific way in which the instance could be modified to receive an alternate outcome. Existing recourse generation methods often assume that the machine learning model does not change over time, but this assumption does not always hold in practice because of data distribution shifts, and in this case, the recourse action may become invalid. To redress this shortcoming, we propose the Distributionally Robust Recourse Action (DiRRAc) framework, which generates a recourse action that has a high probability of being valid under a mixture of model shifts. We formulate the robustified recourse setup as a min-max optimization problem, where the max problem is specified by Gelbrich distance over an ambiguity set around the distribution of model parameters. We suggest a projected gradient descent algorithm to find a robust recourse according to the min-max objective. The DiRRAc framework can be extended to hedge against the misspecification of the mixture weights, and numerical experiments with both synthetic and three real-world datasets demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art recourse methods.},

Following prior work, we assume that there are at most $\alpha \in (0,c)$ for some $c<1$ fraction of false positives and false negatives in each predicted cluster, in the absence of which the labels would attain the optimal clustering cost OPT. For a dataset of size $m$, we propose a deterministic k-means algorithm that produces centers with an improved bound on the clustering cost compared to the previous randomized state-of-the-art algorithm while preserving the $O(dm \log m)$ runtime.

  abstract     = {The notion of neural collapse refers to several emergent phenomena that have been empirically observed across various canonical classification problems. During the terminal phase of training a deep neural network, the feature embedding of all examples of the same class tend to collapse to a single representation, and the features of different classes tend to separate as much as possible. Neural collapse is often studied through a simplified model, called the layer-peeled model, in which the network is assumed to have 'infinite expressivity' and can map each data point to any arbitrary representation. In this work we study a more realistic variant of the layer-peeled model, which takes the positivity of the features into account. Furthermore, we extend this model to also incorporate the limited expressivity of the network. Empirical evidence suggests that the memorization of noisy data points leads to a degradation (dilation) of the neural collapse.},

Using our framework, we derive popular attention layers used in practice and propose two new attentions: 1) the Batch Normalized Attention (Attention-BN) derived from the batch normalization layer and 2) the Attention with Scaled Head (Attention-SH) derived from using less training data to fit the SVR model. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of the Attention-BN and Attention-SH in reducing head redundancy, increasing the model's accuracy, and improving the model's efficiency in a variety of practical applications including image and time-series classification.},

  abstract     = {Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance has been widely used in different application scenarios since it can be scaled to a large number of supports without suffering from the curse of dimensionality. The value of sliced Wasserstein distance is the average of transportation cost between one-dimensional representations (projections) of original measures that are obtained by Radon Transform (RT). Despite its efficiency in the number of supports, estimating the sliced Wasserstein requires a relatively large number of projections in high-dimensional settings. Therefore, for applications where the number of supports is relatively small compared with the dimension, e.g., several deep learning applications where the mini-batch approaches are utilized, the complexities from matrix multiplication of Radon Transform become the main computational bottleneck. To address this issue, we propose to derive projections by linearly and randomly combining a smaller number of projections which are named bottleneck projections. We explain the usage of these projections by introducing Hierarchical Radon Transform (HRT) which is constructed by applying Radon Transform variants recursively. We then formulate the approach into a new metric between measures, named Hierarchical Sliced Wasserstein (HSW) distance. By proving the injectivity of HRT, we derive the metricity of HSW. Moreover, we investigate the theoretical properties of HSW including its connection to SW variants and its computational and sample complexities. Finally, we compare the computational cost and generative quality of HSW with the conventional SW on the task of deep generative modeling using various benchmark datasets including CIFAR10, CelebA, and Tiny ImageNet.},

  abstract     = {An oft-cited challenge of federated learning is the presence of heterogeneity. Data heterogeneity refers to the fact that data from different clients may follow very different distributions. System heterogeneity refers to client devices having different system capabilities. A considerable number of federated optimization methods address this challenge. In the literature, empirical evaluations usually start federated training from random initialization. However, in many practical applications of federated learning, the server has access to proxy data for the training task that can be used to pre-train a model before starting federated training. Using four standard federated learning benchmark datasets, we empirically study the impact of starting from a pre-trained model in federated learning. Unsurprisingly, starting from a pre-trained model reduces the training time required to reach a target error rate and enables the training of more accurate models (up to 40%) than is possible when starting from random initialization. Surprisingly, we also find that starting federated learning from a pre-trained initialization reduces the effect of both data and system heterogeneity. We recommend future work proposing and evaluating federated optimization methods to evaluate the performance when starting from random and pre-trained initializations. This study raises several questions for further work on understanding the role of heterogeneity in federated optimization.},

Empowering deep learning with this ability undoubtedly enables the neural network to handle complex vision tasks, e.g., object detection, without collecting and annotating real images. To this end, this paper introduces a novel challenging learning paradigm Imaginary-Supervised Object Detection (ISOD), where neither real images nor manual annotations are allowed for training object detectors. To resolve this challenge, we propose ImaginaryNet, a framework to synthesize images by combining pretrained language model and text-to-image synthesis model. Given a class label, the language model is used to generate a full description of a scene with a target object, and the text-to-image model is deployed to generate a photo-realistic image. With the synthesized images and class labels, weakly supervised object detection can then be leveraged to accomplish ISOD. By gradually introducing real images and manual annotations, ImaginaryNet can collaborate with other supervision settings to further boost detection performance. Experiments show that ImaginaryNet can (i) obtain about 70% performance in ISOD compared with the weakly supervised counterpart of the same backbone trained on real data, (ii) significantly improve the baseline while achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance by incorporating ImaginaryNet with other supervision settings.},

One key challenge of finetuning them to solve such math reasoning problems is that many existing datasets only contain one reference solution for each problem, despite the fact that there are often alternative solutions resembling different reasoning paths to the final answer. This way, the finetuned models are biased towards the limited reference solutions, which limits their generalization to unseen examples. To mitigate this issue, we propose to let the model perform sampling during training and learn from both self-sampled fully-correct solutions, which yield the correct answer upon execution, and partially-correct solutions, whose intermediate state matches an intermediate state of a known correct solution.},

  abstract     = {Neural Motion Planners (NMPs) have emerged as a promising tool for solving robot navigation tasks in complex environments. However, these methods often require expert data for learning, which limits their application to scenarios where data generation is time-consuming. Recent developments have also led to physics-informed deep neural models capable of representing complex dynamical Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Inspired by these developments, we propose Neural Time Fields (NTFields) for robot motion planning in cluttered scenarios. Our framework represents a wave propagation model generating continuous arrival time to find path solutions informed by a nonlinear first-order PDE called Eikonal Equation. We evaluate our method in various cluttered 3D environments, including the Gibson dataset, and demonstrate its ability to solve motion planning problems for 4-DOF and 6-DOF robot manipulators where the traditional grid-based Eikonal planners often face the curse of dimensionality.},

  abstract     = {We propose an efficient design of Transformer-based models for multivariate time series forecasting and self-supervised representation learning. It is based on two key components: (i) segmentation of time series into subseries-level patches which are served as input tokens to Transformer; (ii) channel-independence where each channel contains a single univariate time series that shares the same embedding and Transformer weights across all the series. Patching design naturally has three-fold benefit: local semantic information is retained in the embedding; computation and memory usage of the attention maps are quadratically reduced given the same look-back window; and the model can attend longer history. Our channel-independent patch time series Transformer (PatchTST) can improve the long-term forecasting accuracy significantly when compared with that of SOTA Transformer-based models. We also apply our model to self-supervised pre-training tasks and attain excellent fine-tuning performance, which outperforms supervised training on large datasets. Transferring of masked pre-trained representation on one dataset to others also produces SOTA forecasting accuracy.},

Considering the differences between VRL and SRL in terms of negative sample size and evaluation focus, we believe that the solid findings obtained in VRL may not be entirely carried over to SRL. In this work, we consider the suitability of the decoupled form of contrastive loss, i.e., alignment and uniformity, in SRL. We find a performance gap between sentence representations obtained by jointly optimizing alignment and uniformity on the STS task and those obtained using contrastive loss. Further, we find that the joint optimization of alignment and uniformity during training is prone to overfitting, which does not occur on the contrastive loss. Analyzing them based on the variation of the gradient norms, we find that there is a property of "gradient dissipation" in contrastive loss and believe that it is the key to preventing overfitting. We simulate similar "gradient dissipation" of contrastive loss on four optimization objectives of two forms, and achieve the same or even better performance than contrastive loss on the STS tasks, confirming our hypothesis.},

The prevalence of large language models advances the state-of-the-art for program synthesis, though limited training resources and data impede open access to such models. To democratize this, we train and release a family of large language models up to 16.1B parameters, called CODEGEN, on natural language and programming language data, and open source the training library JAXFORMER. We show the utility of the trained model by demonstrating that it is competitive with the previous state-of-the-art on zero-shot Python code generation on HumanEval. We further investigate the multi-step paradigm for program synthesis, where a single program is factorized into multiple prompts specifying subproblems. To this end, we construct an open benchmark, Multi-Turn Programming Benchmark (MTPB), consisting of 115 diverse problem sets that are factorized into multi-turn prompts. Our analysis on MTPB shows that the same intent provided to CODEGEN in multi-turn fashion significantly improves program synthesis over that provided as a single turn.},

  abstract     = {We provide sharp path-dependent generalization and excess risk guarantees for the full-batch Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm on smooth losses (possibly non-Lipschitz, possibly nonconvex). At the heart of our analysis is an upper bound on the generalization error, which implies that average output stability and a bounded expected optimization error at termination lead to generalization. This result shows that a small generalization error occurs along the optimization path, and allows us to bypass Lipschitz or sub-Gaussian assumptions on the loss prevalent in previous works. For nonconvex, convex, and strongly convex losses, we show the explicit dependence of the generalization error in terms of the accumulated path-dependent optimization error, terminal optimization error, number of samples, and number of iterations. For nonconvex smooth losses, we prove that full-batch GD efficiently generalizes close to any stationary point at termination, and recovers the generalization error guarantees of stochastic algorithms with fewer assumptions. For smooth convex losses, we show that the generalization error is tighter than existing bounds for SGD (up to one order of error magnitude). Consequently the excess risk matches that of SGD for quadratically less iterations. Lastly, for strongly convex smooth losses, we show that full-batch GD achieves essentially the same excess risk rate as compared with the state of the art on SGD, but with an exponentially smaller number of iterations (logarithmic in the dataset size).},

  abstract     = {Test-time adaptation (TTA) has shown to be effective at tackling distribution shifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model on test samples. However, the online model updating of TTA may be unstable and this is often a key obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world. Specifically, TTA may fail to improve or even harm the model performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch sizes, and 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts, which are quite common in practice. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases. By digging into the failure cases, we find that certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disturb the model adaption and result in collapsed trivial solutions, i.e., assigning the same class label for all samples. To address the above collapse issue, we propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Promising results demonstrate that SAR performs more stably over prior methods and is computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.},

Meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) emerged recently as a promising class of models for graph-structured data in semi-supervised learning and beyond. Their competitive performance is often attributed to a proper capturing of the graph inductive bias. In this work, we introduce this inductive bias into GPs to improve their predictive performance for graph-structured data. We show that a prominent example of GNNs, the graph convolutional network, is equivalent to some GP when its layers are infinitely wide; and we analyze the kernel universality and the limiting behavior in depth. We further present a programmable procedure to compose covariance kernels inspired by this equivalence and derive example kernels corresponding to several interesting members of the GNN family. We also propose a computationally efficient approximation of the covariance matrix for scalable posterior inference with large-scale data. We demonstrate that these graph-based kernels lead to competitive classification and regression performance, as well as advantages in computation time, compared with the respective GNNs.},

  abstract     = {The monotonic dependence of the outputs of a neural network on some of its inputs is a crucial inductive bias in many scenarios where domain knowledge dictates such behavior. This is especially important for interpretability and fairness considerations. In a broader context, scenarios in which monotonicity is important can be found in finance, medicine, physics, and other disciplines. It is thus desirable to build neural network architectures that implement this inductive bias provably. In this work, we propose a weight-constrained architecture with a single residual connection to achieve exact monotonic dependence in any subset of the inputs. The weight constraint scheme directly controls the Lipschitz constant of the neural network and thus provides the additional benefit of robustness. Compared to currently existing techniques used for monotonicity, our method is simpler in implementation and in theory foundations, has negligible computational overhead, is guaranteed to produce monotonic dependence, and is highly expressive. We show how the algorithm is used to train powerful, robust, and interpretable discriminators that achieve competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks, from social applications to the classification of the decays of subatomic particles produced at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.},

  abstract     = {A number of competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain why small-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) leads to improved generalization over the full-batch regime, with recent work crediting the implicit regularization of various quantities throughout training. However, to date, empirical evidence assessing the explanatory power of these hypotheses is lacking. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, focusing on the ability of various theorized mechanisms to close the small-to-large batch generalization gap. Additionally, we characterize how the quantities that SGD has been claimed to (implicitly) regularize change over the course of training. By using micro-batches, i.e. disjoint smaller subsets of each mini-batch, we empirically show that explicitly penalizing the gradient norm or the Fisher Information Matrix trace, averaged over micro-batches, in the large-batch regime recovers small-batch SGD generalization, whereas Jacobian-based regularizations fail to do so. This generalization performance is shown to often be correlated with how well the regularized model's gradient norms resemble those of small-batch SGD. We additionally show that this behavior breaks down as the micro-batch size approaches the batch size. Finally, we note that in this line of inquiry, positive experimental findings on CIFAR10 are often reversed on other datasets like CIFAR100, highlighting the need to test hypotheses on a wider collection of datasets.},

  abstract     = {Neural Algorithmic Reasoning is an emerging area of machine learning which seeks to infuse algorithmic computation in neural networks, typically by training neural models to approximate steps of classical algorithms. In this context, much of the current work has focused on learning reachability and shortest path graph algorithms, showing that joint learning on similar algorithms is beneficial for generalisation. However, when targeting more complex problems, such similar algorithms become more difficult to find. Here, we propose to learn algorithms by exploiting duality of the underlying algorithmic problem. Many algorithms solve optimisation problems. We demonstrate that simultaneously learning the dual definition of these optimisation problems in algorithmic learning allows for better learning and qualitatively better solutions. Specifically, we exploit the max-flow min-cut theorem to simultaneously learn these two algorithms over synthetically generated graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We then validate the real-world utility of our dual algorithmic reasoner by deploying it on a challenging brain vessel classification task, which likely depends on the vessels' flow properties. We demonstrate a clear performance gain when using our model within such a context, and empirically show that learning the max-flow and min-cut algorithms together is critical for achieving such a result.},

Continuous approaches capture rotational equivariance but are often prohibitively computationally demanding. Discrete approaches offer more favorable computational performance but at the cost of equivariance. We develop a hybrid discrete-continuous (DISCO) group convolution that is simultaneously equivariant and computationally scalable to high-resolution. While our framework can be applied to any compact group, we specialize to the sphere. Our DISCO spherical convolutions exhibit SO(3) rotational equivariance, where SO(n) is the special orthogonal group representing rotations in n-dimensions. When restricting rotations of the convolution to the quotient space SO(3)/SO(2) for further computational enhancements, we recover a form of asymptotic SO(3) rotational equivariance. Through a sparse tensor implementation we achieve linear scaling in number of pixels on the sphere for both computational cost and memory usage. For 4k spherical images we realize a saving of 10^9 in computational cost and 10^4 in memory usage when compared to the most efficient alternative equivariant spherical convolution. We apply the DISCO spherical CNN framework to a number of benchmark dense-prediction problems on the sphere and achieve state-of-the-art performance.},

The key idea is to add imaginary rewards using the peer prediction method, i.e., a mechanism for evaluating the validity of information exchanged between agents in a decentralized environment.

This poor performance creates a barrier for adopting CBMs in practical real world applications. Motivated by these challenges, we propose Label-free CBM which is a novel framework to transform any neural network into an interpretable CBM without labeled concept data, while retaining a high accuracy. Our Label-free CBM has many advantages, it is: scalable - we present the first CBM scaled to ImageNet, efficient - creating a CBM takes only a few hours even for very large datasets, and automated - training it for a new dataset requires minimal human effort. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on real world datasets and show that it performs competitively with standard neural networks while providing interpretability.},

This coordination, in which the dynamics of the motor system co-evolved to reduce the computational burden on the brain, is referred to as 'mechanical intelligence' or 'morphological computation'. In this work, we seek to develop machine learning analogs of this process, in which we jointly learn the morphology of complex nonlinear elastic solids along with a deep neural network to control it. By using a specialized differentiable simulator of elastic mechanics coupled to conventional deep learning architectures -- which we refer to as neuromechanical autoencoders -- we are able to learn to perform morphological computation via gradient descent. Key to our approach is the use of mechanical metamaterials -- cellular solids, in particular -- as the morphological substrate. Just as deep neural networks provide flexible and massively-parametric function approximators for perceptual and control tasks, cellular solid metamaterials are promising as a rich and learnable space for approximating a variety of actuation tasks. In this work we take advantage of these complementary computational concepts to co-design materials and neural network controls to achieve nonintuitive mechanical behavior. We demonstrate in simulation how it is possible to achieve translation, rotation, and shape matching, as well as a 'digital MNIST' task. We additionally manufacture and evaluate one of the designs to verify its real-world behavior.},

However, the scope of weak supervision supported by these approaches has been very restrictive, preventing them to use all available information. In this work, we propose ProbKT, a framework based on probabilistic logical reasoning that allows to train object detection models with arbitrary types of weak supervision. We empirically show on different datasets that using all available information is beneficial as our ProbKT leads to significant improvement on target domain and better generalization compared to existing baselines. We also showcase the ability of our approach to handle complex logic statements as supervision signal.},

Our evaluation shows strong performance with less than 0.33ns error in time-of-flight predictions across multiple indoor scenarios. Additionally, our neural surrogate enables inverse rendering applications such as user localization by making wireless simulators more interpretable.},

  abstract     = {Implicit processes (IPs) are a generalization of Gaussian processes (GPs). IPs may lack a closed-form expression but are easy to sample from. Examples include, among others, Bayesian neural networks or neural samplers. IPs can be used as priors over functions, resulting in flexible models with well-calibrated prediction uncertainty estimates. Methods based on IPs usually carry out function-space approximate inference, which overcomes some of the difficulties of parameter-space approximate inference. Nevertheless, the approximations employed often limit the expressiveness of the final model, resulting, e.g., in a Gaussian predictive distribution, which can be restrictive. We propose here a multi-layer generalization of IPs called the Deep Variational Implicit process (DVIP). This generalization is similar to that of deep GPs over GPs, but it is more flexible due to the use of IPs as the prior distribution over the latent functions. We describe a scalable variational inference algorithm for training DVIP and show that it outperforms previous IP-based methods and also deep GPs. We support these claims via extensive regression and classification experiments. We also evaluate DVIP on large datasets with up to several million data instances to illustrate its good scalability and performance.},

This heterogeneity has motivated the design of personalized learning, where individual personalized models are trained through collaboration. There have been various personalization methods proposed in literature, with seemingly very different forms and methods ranging from use of a single global model for local regularization and model interpolation, to use of multiple global models for personalized clustering. We begin with a generative framework that could potentially unify several different algorithms as well as suggest new algorithms. We apply this generative framework to personalized estimation and connect it to the classical empirical Bayes methodology. We also develop private personalized estimation under this framework. We propose new personalized learning algorithms, including AdaPeD based on information-geometry regularization, which numerically outperforms several known algorithms. We also develop privacy for personalized learning methods with guarantees for user-level privacy and composition.},

UDA is important in many applications such as medicine, where it is used to adapt risk scores across different patient cohorts. In this paper, we develop a novel framework for UDA of time series data, called CLUDA. Specifically, we propose a contrastive learning framework to learn contextual representations in multivariate time series, so that these preserve label information for the prediction task. In our framework, we further capture the variation in the contextual representations between source and target domain via a custom nearest-neighbor contrastive learning. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first framework to learn domain-invariant, contextual representation for UDA of time series data. We evaluate our framework using a wide range of time series datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance for time series UDA.},

Exhausting the search space for all possible genetic edits (perturbations) or combinations thereof is infeasible due to cost and experimental limitations. This work provides a theoretically sound framework for iteratively exploring the space of perturbations in pooled batches in order to maximize a target phenotype under an experimental budget. Inspired by this application domain, we study the problem of batch query bandit optimization and introduce the Optimistic Arm Elimination (OAE) principle designed to find an almost optimal arm under different functional relationships between the queries (arms) and the outputs (rewards). We analyze the convergence properties of OAE by relating it to the Eluder dimension of the algorithm's function class. We validate that OAE outperforms other strategies in finding optimal actions in experiments on simulated problems, public datasets well-studied in bandit contexts, and in genetic perturbation datasets. OAE also outperforms the benchmark algorithms in 3 of 4 datasets in the GeneDisco experimental planning challenge.},

We propose D-BAT (Diversity-By-disAgreement Training) which enforces agreement among the models on the training data, but disagreement on the OOD data. We show how D-BAT can mitigate shortcut-learning, enhance uncertainty and OOD detection, as well as improve transferability.

In each round, our algorithm recommends one item per user and gets a (noisy) reward sampled from a low-rank user-item preference matrix. Our goal is to design a method with sub-linear regret (in T) and nearly optimal dependence on M and N. We show that the low-rank structure can be exploited using a simple explore-then-commit (ETC) approach that ensures a regret of O(polylog(M+N) T^{2/3}). That is, roughly only polylog(M+N) item recommendations are required per user to get a non-trivial solution. For the rank-1 setting, we propose OCTAL (Online Collaborative filTering using iterAtive user cLustering) that guarantees nearly optimal regret of O(polylog(M+N) T^{1/2}). OCTAL is based on a novel technique of clustering users that allows iterative elimination of items and leads to a nearly optimal minimax rate. The problem can be easily mapped to the standard multi-armed bandit problem where each item is an independent arm, but that leads to poor regret as the correlation between arms and users is not exploited. On the other hand, exploiting the low-rank structure of reward matrix is challenging due to non-convexity of the low-rank manifold.},

We also show theoretically and empirically that uniform label noise is more harmful than typical real-world label noise. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for training on noisy datasets.},

  abstract     = {Model-based reinforcement learning is one approach to increase sample efficiency. However, the accuracy of the dynamics model and the resulting compounding error over modelled trajectories are commonly regarded as key limitations. A natural question to ask is: How much more sample efficiency can be gained by improving the learned dynamics models? Our paper empirically answers this question for the class of model-based value expansion methods in continuous control problems. Value expansion methods should benefit from increased model accuracy by enabling longer rollout horizons and better value function approximations. Our empirical study, which leverages oracle dynamics models to avoid compounding model errors, shows that: (1) Longer horizons increase sample efficiency, but the gain in improvement decreases with each additional expansion step (2) The increased model accuracy only marginally increases the sample efficiency compared to learned models with identical horizons. Therefore, longer horizons and increased model accuracy yield diminishing returns in terms of sample efficiency. These improvements are particularly disappointing when compared to model-free value expansion methods. Even though model-free methods introduce no computational overhead, we find their performance to be on-par with model-based value expansion methods. Therefore, we conclude that the limitation of model-based value expansion methods is not the model accuracy of the learned models. While higher model accuracy is beneficial, our experiments show that even a perfect model will not provide an un-rivaled sample efficiency but that the bottleneck lies elsewhere.},

  abstract     = {For generative autoencoders to learn a meaningful latent representation for data generation, a careful balance must be achieved between reconstruction error and how close the distribution in the latent space is to the prior. However, this balance is challenging to achieve due to a lack of criteria that work both at the mini-batch (local) and aggregated posterior (global) level. In this work, we develop the Goodness of Fit Autoencoder (GoFAE), which incorporates hypothesis tests at two levels. At the mini-batch level, it uses GoF test statistics as regularization objectives. At a more global level, it selects a regularization coefficient based on higher criticism, i.e., a test on the uniformity of the local GoF p-values. We justify the use of GoF tests by providing a relaxed L₂-Wasserstein bound on the distance between the latent distribution and target prior. We propose to use GoF tests and prove that optimization based on these tests can be done with stochastic gradient (SGD) descent on a compact Riemannian manifold. Empirically, we show that our higher criticism parameter selection procedure balances reconstruction and generation using mutual information and uniformity of p-values respectively. Finally, we show that GoFAE achieves comparable FID scores and mean squared errors with competing deep generative models while retaining statistical indistinguishability from Gaussian in the latent space based on a variety of hypothesis tests.},

However, all existing variants of multimodal VAEs are affected by a non-trivial trade-off between generative quality and generative coherence. In particular mixture-based models achieve good coherence only at the expense of sample diversity and a resulting lack of generative quality. We present a novel variant of the mixture-of-experts multimodal variational autoencoder that improves its generative quality, while maintaining high semantic coherence. We model shared and modality-specific information in separate latent subspaces, proposing an objective that overcomes certain dependencies on hyperparameters that arise for existing approaches with the same latent space structure. Compared to these existing approaches, we show increased robustness with respect to changes in the design of the latent space, in terms of the capacity allocated to modality-specific subspaces. We show that our model achieves both good generative coherence and high generative quality in challenging experiments, including more complex multimodal datasets than those used in previous works.},

In addition, it is hard to adapt to the evolving world knowledge without the costly model re-training. In this paper, we develop a novel semi-parametric language model architecture, Knowledge-in-Context (KiC), which empowers a parametric text-to-text language model with a knowledge-rich external memory. Specifically, the external memory contains six different types of knowledge: entity, dictionary, commonsense, event, script, and causality knowledge. For each input instance, the KiC model adaptively selects a knowledge type and retrieves the most helpful pieces of knowledge. The input instance along with its knowledge augmentation is fed into a text-to-text model (e.g., T5) to generate the output answer, where both the input and the output are in natural language forms after prompting. Interestingly, we find that KiC can be identified as a special mixture-of-experts (MoE) model, where the knowledge selector plays the role of a router that is used to determine the sequence-to-expert assignment in MoE. This key observation inspires us to develop a novel algorithm for training KiC with an instance-adaptive knowledge selector. As a knowledge-rich semi-parametric language model, KiC only needs a much smaller parametric part to achieve superior zero-shot performance on unseen tasks. By evaluating on 40+ different tasks, we show that KiC-Large with 770M parameters easily outperforms large language models that are 4-39x larger. In addition, KiC also exhibits emergent abilities at a much smaller model scale compared to the fully-parametric models.},

Its effectiveness has been shown in discovering high-quality and diverse solutions, compared to reward-maximizing reinforcement learning-based methods. Nonetheless, GFlowNets only learn from rewards of the terminal states, which can limit its applicability. Indeed, intermediate rewards play a critical role in learning, for example from intrinsic motivation to provide intermediate feedback even in particularly challenging sparse reward tasks. Inspired by this, we propose Generative Augmented Flow Networks (GAFlowNets), a novel learning framework to incorporate intermediate rewards into GFlowNets. We specify intermediate rewards by intrinsic motivation to tackle the exploration problem in sparse reward environments. GAFlowNets can leverage edge-based and state-based intrinsic rewards in a joint way to improve exploration. Based on extensive experiments on the GridWorld task, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GAFlowNet in terms of convergence, performance, and diversity of solutions. We further show that GAFlowNet is scalable to a more complex and large-scale molecule generation domain, where it achieves consistent and significant performance improvement.},

However, it is still unclear 1) how MRP performs semantic (feature) learning in the pretraining phase and 2) why it helps in downstream tasks. To solve these problems, we first theoretically show that on an auto-encoder of a two/one-layered convolution encoder/decoder, MRP can capture all discriminative semantics of each potential semantic class in the pretraining dataset. Then considering the fact that the pretraining dataset is of huge size and high diversity and thus covers most semantics in downstream dataset, in fine-tuning phase, the pretrained encoder can capture as much semantics as it can in downstream tasks. These analyses are validated by experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.},

As a proof-of-concept, we present EVAS, a new attack that leverages NAS to find neural architectures with inherent backdoors and exploits such vulnerability using input-aware triggers. Compared with existing backdoor attacks, EVAS demonstrates several unique advantages: (1) it does not require polluting training data or manipulating model parameters; (2) it is agnostic to downstream fine-tuning or even re-training from scratch; (3) it naturally evades defenses that rely on inspecting model parameters or training data. With extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets, we show that EVAS features high evasiveness, transferability, and robustness, thereby expanding the adversary's design spectrum. We further characterize the mechanisms underlying EVAS, which are possibly explainable by architecture-level ``shortcuts'' that recognize trigger patterns. This work showcases that NAS can be exploited in a harmful way to find architectures with inherent backdoor vulnerability.},

However, real-world graphs are likely to be better represented by a model in which the sampling density and the neighborhood radius can both vary over the latent space. For instance, in a social network communities can be modeled as densely sampled areas, and hubs as nodes with larger neighborhood radius. In this work, we first provide theory for the concentration of the empirical graph Laplacian of a non-uniform geometric graph to its population counterpart. Second, we propose practical estimators for the unknown sampling density and neighborhood radius functions, and prove their consistency.

Group distributionally robust optimization (G-DRO) can alleviate this problem by minimizing the worst-case loss over a set of pre-defined groups over training data. G-DRO successfully improves performance of the worst group, where the correlation does not hold. However, G-DRO assumes that the spurious correlations and associated worst groups are known in advance, making it challenging to apply them to new tasks with potentially multiple unknown correlations. We propose AGRO -- Adversarial Group discovery for Distributionally Robust Optimization -- an end-to-end approach that jointly identifies error-prone groups and improves accuracy on them. AGRO equips G-DRO with an adversarial slicing model to find a group assignment for training examples which maximizes worst-case loss over the discovered groups. On the WILDS benchmark, AGRO results in 8\% higher model performance on average on known worst-groups, compared to prior group discovery approaches used with G-DRO. AGRO also improves out-of-distribution performance on SST2, QQP, and MS-COCO -- datasets where potential spurious correlations are as yet uncharacterized.},

Also, previous works pay little attention to the attributes of each bounding box (e.g., nearest object, box size) when computing the informativeness of an image. To make use of epistemic uncertainty, we adopt evidential deep learning (EDL) and propose a new module termed model evidence head (MEH), that makes EDL highly compatible with object detection. Based on the computed epistemic uncertainty of each bounding box, we propose hierarchical uncertainty aggregation (HUA) for obtaining the informativeness of an image. HUA realigns all bounding boxes into multiple levels based on the attributes and aggregates uncertainties in a bottom-up order, to effectively capture the context within the image. Experimental results show that our solution outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin.},

  abstract     = {We present a comparative study on how and why contrastive learning (CL) and masked image modeling (MIM) differ in their representations and in their performance of downstream tasks. In particular, we demonstrate that self-supervised Vision Transformers (ViTs) have the following properties: (1) CL trains self-attentions to capture longer-range global patterns than MIM, such as the shape of an object, especially in the later layers of the ViT architecture. This CL property helps ViTs linearly separate images in their representation spaces. However, it also makes the self-attentions collapse into homogeneity for all query tokens and heads. Such homogeneity of self-attention reduces the diversity of representations, worsening scalability and dense prediction performance. (2) CL utilizes the low-frequency signals of the representations, but MIM utilizes high-frequencies. Since low- and high-frequency information respectively represent shapes and textures, CL is more shape-oriented and MIM more texture-oriented. (3) CL plays a crucial role in the later layers, while MIM mainly focuses on the early layers. Upon these analyses, we find that CL and MIM can complement each other and observe that even the simplest harmonization can help leverage the advantages of both methods.

  abstract     = {Given a graph learning task, such as link prediction, on a new graph, how can we select the best method as well as its hyperparameters (collectively called a model) without having to train or evaluate any model on the new graph? Model selection for graph learning has been largely ad hoc. A typical approach has been to apply popular methods to new datasets, but this is often suboptimal. On the other hand, systematically comparing models on the new graph quickly becomes too costly, or even impractical. In this work, we develop the first meta-learning approach for evaluation-free graph learning model selection, called MetaGL, which utilizes the prior performances of existing methods on various benchmark graph datasets to automatically select an effective model for the new graph, without any model training or evaluations. To quantify similarities across a wide variety of graphs, we introduce specialized meta-graph features that capture the structural characteristics of a graph. Then we design G-M network, which represents the relations among graphs and models, and develop a graph-based meta-learner operating on this G-M network, which estimates the relevance of each model to different graphs. Extensive experiments show that using MetaGL to select a model for the new graph greatly outperforms several existing meta-learning techniques tailored for graph learning model selection (up to 47% better), while being extremely fast at test time (~1 sec).},

  abstract     = {Understanding the interaction between multiple agents is crucial for realistic vehicle trajectory prediction. Existing methods have attempted to infer the interaction from the observed past trajectories of agents using pooling, attention, or graph-based methods, which rely on a deterministic approach. However, these methods can fail under complex road structures, as they cannot predict various interactions that may occur in the future. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses lane information to predict a stochastic future relationship among agents. To obtain a coarse future motion of agents, our method first predicts the probability of lane-level waypoint occupancy of vehicles. We then utilize the temporal probability of passing adjacent lanes for each agent pair, assuming that agents passing adjacent lanes will highly interact. We also model the interaction using a probabilistic distribution, which allows for multiple possible future interactions. The distribution is learned from the posterior distribution of interaction obtained from ground truth future trajectories. We validate our method on popular trajectory prediction datasets: nuScenes and Argoverse. The results show that the proposed method brings remarkable performance gain in prediction accuracy, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-term prediction benchmark dataset.},

  abstract     = {While recent camera-only 3D detection methods leverage multiple timesteps, the limited history they use significantly hampers the extent to which temporal fusion can improve object perception. Observing that existing works' fusion of multi-frame images are instances of temporal stereo matching, we find that performance is hindered by the interplay between 1) the low granularity of matching resolution and 2) the sub-optimal multi-view setup produced by limited history usage. Our theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrates that the optimal temporal difference between views varies significantly for different pixels and depths, making it necessary to fuse many timesteps over long-term history. Building on our investigation, we propose to generate a cost volume from a long history of image observations, compensating for the coarse but efficient matching resolution with a more optimal multi-view matching setup. Further, we augment the per-frame monocular depth predictions used for long-term, coarse matching with short-term, fine-grained matching and find that long and short term temporal fusion are highly complementary. While maintaining high efficiency, our framework sets new state-of-the-art on nuScenes, achieving first place on the test set and outperforming previous best art by 5.2% mAP and 3.7% NDS on the validation set.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent agents need to remember salient information to reason in partially-observed environments. For example, agents with a first-person view should remember the positions of relevant objects even if they go out of view. Similarly, to effectively navigate through rooms agents need to remember the floor plan of how rooms are connected. However, most benchmark tasks in reinforcement learning do not test long-term memory in agents, slowing down progress in this important research direction. In this paper, we introduce the Memory Maze, a 3D domain of randomized mazes specifically designed for evaluating long-term memory in agents. Unlike existing benchmarks, Memory Maze measures long-term memory separate from confounding agent abilities and requires the agent to localize itself by integrating information over time. With Memory Maze, we propose an online reinforcement learning benchmark, a diverse offline dataset, and an offline probing evaluation. Recording a human player establishes a strong baseline and verifies the need to build up and retain memories, which is reflected in their gradually increasing rewards within each episode. We find that current algorithms benefit from training with truncated backpropagation through time and succeed on small mazes, but fall short of human performance on the large mazes, leaving room for future algorithmic designs to be evaluated on the Memory Maze.},

  abstract     = {Large language models such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) can perform arbitrary tasks without undergoing fine-tuning after being prompted with only a few labeled examples. An arbitrary task can be reformulated as a natural language prompt, and a language model can be asked to generate the completion, indirectly performing the task in a paradigm known as prompt-based learning. To date, emergent prompt-based learning capabilities have mainly been demonstrated for unidirectional language models. However, bidirectional language models pre-trained on denoising objectives such as masked language modeling produce stronger learned representations for transfer learning. This motivates the possibility of prompting bidirectional models, but their pre-training objectives have made them largely incompatible with the existing prompting paradigm. We present SAP (Sequential Autoregressive Prompting), a technique that enables the prompting of bidirectional models. Utilizing the machine translation task as a case study, we prompt the bidirectional mT5 model (Xue et al., 2021) with SAP and demonstrate its few-shot and zero-shot translations outperform the few-shot translations of unidirectional models like GPT-3 and XGLM (Lin et al., 2021), despite mT5's approximately 50% fewer parameters. We further show SAP is effective on question answering and summarization. For the first time, our results demonstrate prompt-based learning is an emergent property of a broader class of language models, rather than only unidirectional models.},

  abstract     = {Modern deep learning involves training costly, highly overparameterized networks, thus motivating the search for sparser networks that can still be trained to the same accuracy as the full network (i.e. matching). Iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) is a state of the art algorithm that can find such highly sparse matching subnetworks, known as winning tickets. IMP operates by iterative cycles of training, masking smallest magnitude weights, rewinding back to an early training point, and repeating. Despite its simplicity, the underlying principles for when and how IMP finds winning tickets remain elusive. In particular, what useful information does an IMP mask found at the end of training convey to a rewound network near the beginning of training? How does SGD allow the network to extract this information? And why is iterative pruning needed? We develop answers in terms of the geometry of the error landscape. First, we find that—at higher sparsities—pairs of pruned networks at successive pruning iterations are connected by a linear path with zero error barrier if and only if they are matching. This indicates that masks found at the end of training convey the identity of an axial subspace that intersects a desired linearly connected mode of a matching sublevel set. Second, we show SGD can exploit this information due to a strong form of robustness: it can return to this mode despite strong perturbations early in training. Third, we show how the flatness of the error landscape at the end of training determines a limit on the fraction of weights that can be pruned at each iteration of IMP. Finally, we show that the role of retraining in IMP is to find a network with new small weights to prune. Overall, these results make progress toward demystifying the existence of winning tickets by revealing the fundamental role of error landscape geometry.},

  abstract     = {Meta-learning aims to extract useful inductive biases from a set of related datasets. In Bayesian meta-learning, this is typically achieved by constructing a prior distribution over neural network parameters. However, specifying families of computationally viable prior distributions over the high-dimensional neural network parameters is difficult. As a result, existing approaches resort to meta-learning restrictive diagonal Gaussian priors, severely limiting their expressiveness and performance. To circumvent these issues, we approach meta-learning through the lens of functional Bayesian neural network inference, which views the prior as a stochastic process and performs inference in the function space. Specifically, we view the meta-training tasks as samples from the data-generating process and formalize meta-learning as empirically estimating the law of this stochastic process. Our approach can seamlessly acquire and represent complex prior knowledge by meta-learning the score function of the data-generating process marginals instead of parameter space priors. In a comprehensive benchmark, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of predictive accuracy and substantial improvements in the quality of uncertainty estimates.},

  abstract     = {As machine learning models are increasingly being employed to make consequential decisions in real-world settings, it becomes critical to ensure that individuals who are adversely impacted (e.g., loan denied) by the predictions of these models are provided with a means for recourse. While several approaches have been proposed to construct recourses for affected individuals, the recourses output by these methods either achieve low costs (i.e., ease-of-implementation) or robustness to small perturbations (i.e., noisy implementations of recourses), but not both due to the inherent trade-offs between the recourse costs and robustness. Furthermore, prior approaches do not provide end users with any agency over navigating the aforementioned trade-offs. In this work, we address the above challenges by proposing the first algorithmic framework which enables users to effectively manage the recourse cost vs. robustness trade-offs. More specifically, our framework Probabilistically ROBust rEcourse (PROBE) lets users choose the probability with which a recourse could get invalidated (recourse invalidation rate) if small changes are made to the recourse i.e., the recourse is implemented somewhat noisily. To this end, we propose a novel objective function which simultaneously minimizes the gap between the achieved (resulting) and desired recourse invalidation rates, minimizes recourse costs, and also ensures that the resulting recourse achieves a positive model prediction. We develop novel theoretical results to characterize the recourse invalidation rates corresponding to any given instance w.r.t. different classes of underlying models (e.g., linear models, tree based models etc.), and leverage these results to efficiently optimize the proposed objective. Experimental evaluation with multiple real world datasets demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {As machine learning models are increasingly being deployed in high-stakes applications, policymakers have suggested tighter data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). One key principle is the "right to be forgotten" which gives users the right to have their data deleted. Another key principle is the right to an actionable explanation, also known as algorithmic recourse, allowing users to reverse unfavorable decisions. To date, it is unknown whether these two principles can be operationalized simultaneously. Therefore, we introduce and study the problem of recourse invalidation in the context of data deletion requests. More specifically, we theoretically and empirically analyze the behavior of popular state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrate that the recourses generated by these algorithms are likely to be invalidated if a small number of data deletion requests (e.g., 1 or 2) warrant updates of the predictive model. For the setting of differentiable models, we suggest a framework to identify a minimal subset of critical training points which, when removed, maximize the fraction of invalidated recourses. Using our framework, we empirically show that the removal of as little as 2 data instances from the training set can invalidate up to 95 percent of all recourses output by popular state-of-the-art algorithms. Thus, our work raises fundamental questions about the compatibility of "the right to an actionable explanation" in the context of the "right to be forgotten", while also providing constructive insights on the determining factors of recourse robustness.},

This paper studies their application as observation-to-action models for imitating human behaviour in sequential environments. Human behaviour is stochastic and multimodal, with structured correlations between action dimensions. Meanwhile, standard modelling choices in behaviour cloning are limited in their expressiveness and may introduce bias into the cloned policy. We begin by pointing out the limitations of these choices. We then propose that diffusion models are an excellent fit for imitating human behaviour, since they learn an expressive distribution over the joint action space. We introduce several innovations to make diffusion models suitable for sequential environments; designing suitable architectures, investigating the role of guidance, and developing reliable sampling strategies. Experimentally, diffusion models closely match human demonstrations in a simulated robotic control task and a modern 3D gaming environment.},

To this end, recent work has focused on miscalibration, i.e., the over or under confidence of model scores. Yet calibration is not enough: even a perfectly calibrated classifier with the best possible accuracy can have confidence scores that are far from the true posterior probabilities. This is due to the grouping loss, created by samples with the same confidence scores but different true posterior probabilities. Proper scoring rule theory shows that given the calibration loss, the missing piece to characterize individual errors is the grouping loss. While there are many estimators of the calibration loss, none exists for the grouping loss in standard settings. Here, we propose an estimator to approximate the grouping loss. The authors show that modern neural network architectures in vision and NLP exhibit grouping loss, notably in distribution shifts settings, which highlights the importance of pre-production validation.},

Thus, dense models trained via CrAM should be compressible post-training, in a single step, without significant accuracy loss. The paper's key contribution is a new compression-aware minimizer dubbed CrAM, which modifies the SGD training iteration in a principled way, in order to produce models whose local loss behavior is stable under compression operations such as weight pruning or quantization. Experimental results on standard image classification tasks show that CrAM produces dense models that can be more accurate than standard SGD-type baselines, but which are surprisingly stable under weight pruning: for instance, for ResNet50 on ImageNet, CrAM-trained models can lose up to 70% of their weights in one shot with only minor accuracy loss.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a family of stochastic extragradient-type algorithms for a class of nonconvex-nonconcave problems characterized by the weak Minty variational inequality (MVI). Unlike existing results on extragradient methods in the monotone setting, employing diminishing stepsizes is no longer possible in the weak MVI setting. This has led to approaches such as increasing batch sizes per iteration which can however be prohibitively expensive. In contrast, our proposed methods involves two stepsizes and only requires one additional oracle evaluation per iteration. We show that it is possible to keep one fixed stepsize while it is only the second stepsize that is taken to be diminishing, making it interesting even in the monotone setting. Almost sure convergence is established and we provide a unified analysis for this family of schemes which contains a nonlinear generalization of the celebrated primal dual hybrid gradient algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The paper proposes a generic module named Indirection Layer (InLay), which leverages indirection and data internal relationships to effectively construct symbolic indirect representations to improve out-of-distribution generalization capabilities of various neural architectures. InLay receives data input in the form of a sequence of objects, treats it as a complete weighted graph whose vertices are the objects and edge weights are scalars representing relationships between vertices. The input is first mapped via indirection to a symbolic graph with data-independent and trainable vertices. The paper demonstrates that InLay is consistently effective in improving out-of-distribution generalization throughout a comprehensive suite of experiments, including IQ problems, distorted image classification, and few-shot domain adaptation NLP classification. The authors also conducted ablation studies to verify different design choices of InLay.},

Successful solutions require handling changes to new and recurring patterns. However, training deep neural forecaster on the fly is notoriously challenging because of their limited ability to adapt to non-stationary environments and the catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge. In this work, inspired by the Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) theory, we propose Fast and Slow learning Networks (FSNet), a holistic framework for online time-series forecasting to simultaneously deal with abrupt changing and repeating patterns. Particularly, FSNet improves the slowly-learned backbone by dynamically balancing fast adaptation to recent changes and retrieving similar old knowledge. FSNet achieves this mechanism via an interaction between two complementary components of an adapter to monitor each layer's contribution to the lost, and an associative memory to support remembering, updating, and recalling repeating events. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets validate FSNet's efficacy and robustness to both new and recurring patterns.},

  abstract     = {As machine learning ({ML}) algorithms are increasingly used in high-stakes applications, concerns have arisen that they may be biased against certain social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to make {ML} models fair, they typically rely on the assumption that data distributions in training and deployment are identical. Unfortunately, this is commonly violated in practice and a model that is fair during training may lead to an unexpected outcome during its deployment. Although the problem of designing robust {ML} models under dataset shifts has been widely studied, most existing works focus only on the transfer of accuracy. In this paper, we study the transfer of both fairness and accuracy under domain generalization where the data at test time may be sampled from never-before-seen domains. We first develop theoretical bounds on the unfairness and expected loss at deployment, and then derive sufficient conditions under which fairness and accuracy can be perfectly transferred via invariant representation learning. Guided by this, we design a learning algorithm such that fair {ML} models learned with training data still have high fairness and accuracy when deployment environments change. Experiments on real-world data validate the proposed algorithm. Model implementation is available at https://github.com/pth1993/FATDM.},

Let μ (with a mass of U) and ν (with a mass of S) be two discrete mass distributions with S ≤ U and let n be the total number of points in the supports of μ and ν. For a parameter α ∈ [0,S], we consider the minimum-cost transport plan σ_α that transports a mass of α from ν to μ. An {OT}-profile captures the behavior of the cost of σ_α as α varies from 0 to S. We present a novel framework to analyze the properties of the {OT}-profile and also present an algorithm to compute it. When μ and ν are discrete mass distributions, we show that the {OT}-profile is a piecewise-linear non-decreasing convex function. An {OT}-profile is arguably more valuable than the {OT}-cost itself and can be used within applications. Under reasonable outlier assumptions, the first derivative of the {OT}-profile shows a noticeable rise before outlier mass is transported. Using this property, we get an improved prediction accuracy for an outlier detection experiment. We also use this property to predict labels and estimate the class priors within {PU}-Learning experiments on real datasets.},

  abstract     = {Quality Diversity ({QD}) has emerged as a powerful alternative optimization paradigm that aims at generating large and diverse collections of solutions, notably with its flagship algorithm {MAP-ELITES} ({ME}) which evolves solutions through mutations and crossovers. While very effective for some unstructured problems, early {ME} implementations relied exclusively on random search to evolve the population of solutions, rendering them notoriously sample-inefficient for high-dimensional problems, such as when evolving neural networks. Follow-up works considered exploiting gradient information to guide the search in order to address these shortcomings through techniques borrowed from either Black-Box Optimization ({BBO}) or Reinforcement Learning ({RL}). While mixing {RL} techniques with {ME} unlocked state-of-the-art performance for robotics control problems that require a good amount of exploration, it also plagued these {ME} variants with limitations common among {RL} algorithms that {ME} was free of, such as hyperparameter sensitivity, high stochasticity as well as training instability, including when the population size increases as some components are shared across the population in recent approaches. Furthermore, existing approaches mixing {ME} with {RL} tend to be tied to a specific {RL} algorithm, which effectively prevents their use on problems where the corresponding {RL} algorithm fails. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a flexible framework that allows the use of any {RL} algorithm and alleviates the aforementioned limitations by evolving populations of agents (whose definition include hyperparameters and all learnable parameters) instead of just policies. We demonstrate the benefits brought about by our framework through extensive numerical experiments on a number of robotics control problems, some of which with deceptive rewards, taken from the {QD-RL} literature.},

Yet, there is a dearth of such metrics, which inhibits the rapid and efficient progress of language generators. One exception is the recently proposed {Mauve}. In theory, {Mauve} measures an information-theoretic divergence between two probability distributions over strings: one representing the language generator under evaluation; the other representing the true natural language distribution. {Mauve}'s authors argue that its success comes from the qualitative properties of their proposed divergence. Yet in practice, as this divergence is uncomputable, {Mauve} approximates it by measuring the divergence between multinomial distributions over clusters instead, where cluster assignments are attained by grouping strings based on a pre-trained language model's embeddings. As we show, however, this is not a tight approximation -- in either theory or practice. This begs the question: why does {Mauve} work so well? In this work, we show that {Mauve} was right for the wrong reasons, and that its newly proposed divergence is not necessary for its high performance. In fact, classical divergences paired with its proposed cluster-based approximation may actually serve as better evaluation metrics. We finish the paper with a probing analysis; this analysis leads us to conclude that -- by encoding syntactic- and coherence-level features of text, while ignoring surface-level features -- such cluster-based substitutes to string distributions may simply be better for evaluating state-of-the-art language generators.},

  abstract     = {{AlphaZero}-type algorithms may stop improving on single-player tasks in case the value network guiding the tree search is unable to approximate the outcome of an episode sufficiently well. One technique to address this problem is transforming the single-player task through self-competition. The main idea is to compute a scalar baseline from the agent's historical performances and to reshape an episode's reward into a binary output, indicating whether the baseline has been exceeded or not. However, this baseline only carries limited information for the agent about strategies how to improve. We leverage the idea of self-competition and directly incorporate a historical policy into the planning process instead of its scalar performance. Based on the recently introduced {Gumbel AlphaZero} ({GAZ}), we propose our algorithm {GAZ} 'Play-to-Plan' ({GAZ PTP}), in which the agent learns to find strong trajectories by planning against possible strategies of its past self. We show the effectiveness of our approach in two well-known combinatorial optimization problems: the {Traveling Salesman Problem} and the {Job-Shop Scheduling Problem}. With only half of the simulation budget for search, {GAZ PTP} consistently outperforms all selected single-player variants of {GAZ}.},

Additionally, we highlight several other downsides of standard heterophilous datasets, such as low diversity, small size, and extreme class imbalance. To address these limitations, we introduce 5 new heterophilous graph datasets: roman-empire, amazon-ratings, minesweeper, tolokers, and questions. We propose these heterophilous graphs of varying properties that can serve as a better benchmark for evaluating the performance of {GNNs} under heterophily. We show that standard {GNNs} achieve strong results on these heterophilous graphs, almost always outperforming specialized models. Our results question the common belief that standard {GNNs} only work well for homophilous graphs and that specialized methods are required for heterophilous graphs.},

This paper presents {Memory Gym}, a benchmark for testing the memory capabilities of agents and consisting of a suite of {2D} partially observable environments, namely {Mortar Mayhem}, {Mystery Path}, and {Searing Spotlights}. These environments are designed to challenge the memory of agents by requiring them to memorize events across long sequences, be robust to noise, and generalize to novel situations. {Mortar Mayhem} challenges the agent with a sequence of commands that must be memorized and executed in the correct order. {Mystery Path} procedurally generates an invisible path that the agent must memorize while traversing from the origin to the goal. {Searing Spotlights} features a pitch black environment where only randomly moving spotlights unveil information on the environment's ground truth, while posing a threat to the agent. These environments are designed to be unsolvable by memoryless agents and feature strong dependencies on memory with frequent agent-memory interactions. We conduct empirical evaluations using different memory architectures and show that these environments pose significant challenges, with {Searing Spotlights} being particularly difficult for {GRU}-based agents, which remains an open puzzle.},

Both Z and Y are assumed to be continuous-valued but relatively low dimensional, whereas X and its features may be complex and high dimensional. Relevant settings include domain-invariant learning, fairness, and causal learning. The procedure requires just a single ridge regression from Y to kernelized features of Z, which can be done in advance. It is then only necessary to enforce independence of φ(X) from residuals of this regression, which is possible with attractive estimation properties and consistency guarantees. By contrast, earlier measures of conditional feature dependence require multiple regressions for each step of feature learning, resulting in more severe bias and variance, and greater computational cost. When sufficiently rich features are used, we establish that {CIRCE} is zero if and only if φ(X) ⊥⊥ Z | Y. In experiments, we show superior performance to previous methods on challenging benchmarks, including learning conditionally invariant image features.},

In this work, we circumvent these limitations by using a pretrained 2D text-to-image diffusion model to perform text-to-3D synthesis. We introduce a loss based on probability density distillation that enables the use of a 2D diffusion model as a prior for optimization of a parametric image generator. Using this loss in a DeepDream-like procedure, we optimize a randomly-initialized 3D model (a Neural Radiance Field, or NeRF) via gradient descent such that its 2D renderings from random angles achieve a low loss. The resulting 3D model of the given text can be viewed from any angle, relit by arbitrary illumination, or composited into any 3D environment. Our approach requires no 3D training data and no modifications to the image diffusion model, demonstrating the effectiveness of pretrained image diffusion models as priors.},

In contrast to previous practical tricks that address training instability by learning rate warmup, layer normalization, attention formulation, and weight initialization, we show that Lipschitz continuity is a more essential property to ensure training stability. In LipsFormer, we replace unstable Transformer component modules with Lipschitz continuous counterparts: CenterNorm instead of LayerNorm, spectral initialization instead of Xavier initialization, scaled cosine similarity attention instead of dot-product attention, and weighted residual shortcut. We prove that these introduced modules are Lipschitz continuous and derive an upper bound on the Lipschitz constant of LipsFormer. Our experiments show that LipsFormer allows stable training of deep Transformer architectures without the need of careful learning rate tuning such as warmup, yielding a faster convergence and better generalization. As a result, on the ImageNet 1K dataset, LipsFormer-Tiny training for 100 epochs without learning rate warmup attains a top-1 accuracy of 81.6\% which is higher than Swin Transformer-Tiny training for 300 epochs with warmup. Moreover, LipsFormer-Tiny training for 300 epochs achieves a top-1 accuracy of 83.5\% with 4.7G FLOPs and 24M parameters.},

This latent separation is so pervasive that a family of backdoor defenses directly take it as a default assumption (dubbed latent separability assumption), based on which to identify poison samples via cluster analysis in the latent space. An intriguing question consequently follows: is the latent separation unavoidable for backdoor poisoning attacks? This question is central to understanding whether the assumption of latent separability provides a reliable foundation for defending against backdoor poisoning attacks. In this paper, we design adaptive backdoor poisoning attacks to present counter-examples against this assumption. Our methods include two key components: (1) a set of trigger-planted samples correctly labeled to their semantic classes (other than the target class) that can regularize backdoor learning; (2) asymmetric trigger planting strategies that help to boost attack success rate (ASR) as well as to diversify latent representations of poison samples. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our adaptive attacks in bypassing existing latent separation based backdoor defenses. Moreover, our attacks still maintain a high attack success rate with negligible clean accuracy drop. Our studies call for defense designers to take caution when leveraging latent separation as an assumption in their defenses.

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) aims to develop a centralized server that learns from distributed clients via communications without accessing the clients' local data. However, existing works mainly focus on federated learning in a single task scenario with static data. In this paper, we introduce the continual federated learning (CFL) problem, where clients incrementally learn new tasks and history data cannot be stored due to certain reasons, such as limited storage and data retention policy 1. Generative replay (GR) based methods are effective for continual learning without storing history data. However, we fail when trying to intuitively adapt GR models for this setting. By analyzing the behaviors of clients during training, we find the unstable training process caused by distributed training on non-IID data leads to a notable performance degradation. To address this problem, we propose our FedCIL model with two simple but effective solutions: 1. model consolidation and 2. consistency enforcement. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/daiqing98/FedCIL.},

  abstract     = {Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is a challenging machine learning problem yet highly desirable in many high-stake applications. Existing methods suffer from overly pessimistic modeling with low generalization confidence. As generalizing to arbitrary test distributions is impossible, we hypothesize that further structure on the topology of distributions is crucial in developing strong OOD resilience. To this end, we propose topology-aware robust optimization (TRO) that seamlessly integrates distributional topology in a principled optimization framework. More specifically, TRO solves two optimization objectives: (1) Topology Learning which explores data manifold to uncover the distributional topology; (2) Learning on Topology which exploits the topology to constrain robust optimization for tightly-bounded generalization risks. We theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and empirically show that it significantly outperforms the state of the arts in a wide range of tasks including classification, regression, and semantic segmentation. Moreover, we empirically find the data-driven distributional topology is consistent with domain knowledge, enhancing the explainability of our approach.},

  abstract     = {Partial label learning (PLL) is a typical weakly supervised learning problem, where each training example is associated with a set of candidate labels among which only one is true. Most existing PLL approaches assume that the incorrect labels in each training example are randomly picked as the candidate labels and model the generation process of the candidate labels in a simple way. However, these approaches usually do not perform as well as expected due to the fact that the generation process of the candidate labels is always instance-dependent. Therefore, it deserves to be modeled in a refined way. In this paper, we consider instance-dependent PLL and assume that the generation process of the candidate labels could decompose into two sequential parts, where the correct label emerges first in the mind of the annotator but then the incorrect labels related to the feature are also selected with the correct label as candidate labels due to uncertainty of labeling. Motivated by this consideration, we propose a novel PLL method that performs Maximum A Posterior (MAP) based on an explicitly modeled generation process of candidate labels via decomposed probability distribution models. Extensive experiments on manually corrupted benchmark datasets and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {Sequence modeling has important applications in natural language processing and computer vision. Recently, the transformer-based models have shown strong performance on various sequence modeling tasks, which rely on attention to capture pairwise token relations, and position embedding to inject positional information. While showing good performance, the transformer models are inefficient to scale to long input sequences, mainly due to the quadratic space-time complexity of attention. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose to model sequences with a relative position encoded Toeplitz matrix and use a Toeplitz matrix-vector production trick to reduce the space-time complexity of the sequence modeling to log linear. A lightweight sub-network called relative position encoder is proposed to generate relative position coefficients with a fixed budget of parameters, enabling the proposed Toeplitz neural network to deal with varying sequence lengths. In addition, despite being trained on 512-token sequences, our model can extrapolate input sequence length up to 14K tokens in inference with consistent performance. Extensive experiments on autoregressive and bidirectional language modeling, image modeling, and the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark show that our method achieves better performance than its competitors in most downstream tasks while being significantly faster.

This paper thoroughly studies the knowledge transferability of pre-trained VLMs to the medical domain, where we show that well-designed medical prompts are the key to elicit knowledge from pre-trained VLMs. We demonstrate that by prompting with expressive attributes that are shared between domains, the VLM can carry the knowledge across domains and improve its generalization. This mechanism empowers VLMs to recognize novel objects with fewer or without image samples. Furthermore, to avoid the laborious manual designing process, we develop three approaches for automatic generation of medical prompts, which can inject expert-level medical knowledge and image-specific information into the prompts for fine-grained grounding. We conduct extensive experiments on thirteen different medical datasets across various modalities, showing that our well-designed prompts greatly improve the zero-shot performance compared to the default prompts, and our fine-tuned models surpass the supervised models by a significant margin.},

However, training the classifier can be expensive too. We propose an iterative approach that minimizes total overall cost by, at each step, jointly determining which samples to label using humans and which to label using the trained classifier. We validate our approach on well known public data sets such as Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. In some cases, our approach has 6× lower overall cost relative to human labeling the entire data set, and is always cheaper than the cheapest competing strategy.},

However, few attempts have been made to understand the inherent data property of sequence data, neglecting the critical factor that may significantly affect the performance of sequence modeling. The paper theoretically and empirically analyzes a generic property of sequence data, i.e., continuity, and connects this property with the performance of deep models. We empirically observe that different kinds of models for sequence modeling prefer data with different continuity, then theoretically analyze the continuity preference of different models in both time and frequency domains. To further utilize continuity to improve sequence modeling, we propose a simple yet effective Lipschitz Regularizer, that can flexibly adjust data continuity according to model preferences, and bring very little extra computational cost. Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate that altering data continuity via Lipschitz Regularizer can largely improve the performance of many deep models for sequence modeling.},

  abstract     = {Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) are compact and efficient by using binary weights instead of real-valued weights. Current BNNs use latent real-valued weights during training, where several training hyper-parameters are inherited from real-valued networks. The interpretation of several of these hyperparameters is based on the magnitude of the real-valued weights. For BNNs, however, the magnitude of binary weights is not meaningful, and thus it is unclear what these hyperparameters actually do. One example is weight-decay, which aims to keep the magnitude of real-valued weights small. Other examples are latent weight initialization, the learning rate, and learning rate decay, which influence the magnitude of the real-valued weights. The magnitude is interpretable for real-valued weights, but loses its meaning for binary weights. In this paper we offer a new interpretation of these magnitude-based hyperparameters based on higher-order gradient filtering during network optimization. Our analysis makes it possible to understand how magnitude-based hyperparameters influence the training of binary networks which allows for new optimization filters specifically designed for binary neural networks that are independent of their real-valued interpretation. Moreover, our improved understanding reduces the number of hyperparameters, which in turn eases the hyperparameter tuning effort which may lead to better hyperparameter values for improved accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The problem of end-to-end learning of a communication system using an autoencoder -- consisting of an encoder, channel, and decoder modeled using neural networks -- has recently been shown to be an effective approach. A challenge faced in the practical adoption of this learning approach is that under changing channel conditions (e.g. a wireless link), it requires frequent retraining of the autoencoder in order to maintain a low decoding error rate. Since retraining is both time consuming and requires a large number of samples, it becomes impractical when the channel distribution is changing quickly. We propose to address this problem using a fast and sample-efficient (few-shot) domain adaptation method that does not change the encoder and decoder networks. Different from conventional training-time unsupervised or semi-supervised domain adaptation, here we have a trained autoencoder from a source distribution that we want to adapt (at test time) to a target distribution using only a small labeled dataset, and no unlabeled data. We focus on a generative channel model based on the Gaussian mixture density network (MDN), and propose a regularized, parameter-efficient adaptation of the MDN using a set of affine transformations. The learned affine transformations are then used to design an optimal transformation at the decoder input to compensate for the distribution shift, and effectively present to the decoder inputs close to the source distribution. Experiments on many simulated distribution changes common to the wireless setting, and a real mmWave FPGA testbed demonstrate the effectiveness of our method at adaptation using very few target domain samples.},

However, using RL for LM-based generation faces empirical challenges, including training instability due to the combinatorial action space, as well as a lack of open-source libraries and benchmarks customized for LM alignment. We introduce an open-source modular library, RL4LMs (Reinforcement Learning for Language Models), for optimizing language generators with RL. The library consists of on-policy RL algorithms that can be used to train any encoder or encoder-decoder LM in the HuggingFace library with an arbitrary reward function. We present the GRUE (General Reinforced-language Understanding Evaluation) benchmark, a set of 6 language generation tasks which are supervised not by target strings, but by reward functions which capture automated measures of human preference. GRUE is the first leaderboard-style evaluation of RL algorithms for NLP tasks. We introduce an easy-to-use, performant RL algorithm, NLPO (Natural Language Policy Optimization) that learns to effectively reduce the combinatorial action space in language generation. We show 1) that RL techniques are generally better than supervised methods at aligning LMs to human preferences; and 2) that NLPO exhibits greater stability and performance than previous policy gradient methods (e.g., PPO), based on both automatic and human evaluations.},

We leverage the marginalized importance sampling (MIS) formulation of RL and present the first set of offline RL algorithms that are statistically optimal and practical under general function approximation and single-policy concentrability, bypassing the need for uncertainty quantification. In stark contrast to prior algorithms that induce additional conservatism through methods such as behavior regularization, our approach provably eliminates this need and reinterprets regularizers as enforcers of occupancy validity than promoters of conservatism. The key insight is that with the MIS formulation, augmented Lagrangian is enough for statistically optimal offline RL.},

We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, it is not necessary to separate batch statistics when co-training on clean and adversarial inputs, and that it is sufficient to use adapters with few domain-specific parameters for each type of input. We establish that using the classification token of a Vision Transformer (ViT) as an adapter is enough to match the classification performance of dual normalization layers, while using significantly less additional parameters. First, we improve upon the top-1 accuracy of a non-adversarially trained ViT-B16 model by +1.12% on ImageNet (reaching 83.76% top-1 accuracy). Second, we improve the robust accuracy of an adversarially trained ViT-B16 model by +1.8% on ImageNet (reaching 57.9% robust accuracy against PGD attacks). Our results suggest that adapters can be a powerful tool to improve both standard and robust accuracy of vision transformers.}

DiffusER is not only a strong generative model in general, rivalling autoregressive models on several tasks spanning machine translation, summarization, and style transfer; it can also perform other varieties of generation that standard autoregressive models are not well-suited for. For instance, we demonstrate that DiffusER makes it possible for a user to condition generation on a prototype, or an incomplete sequence, and continue revising based on previous edit steps.}

The unlearnable strategies have been introduced to prevent third parties from training on the data without permission. They add perturbations to the users' data before publishing, which aims to make the models trained on the perturbed published dataset invalidated. These perturbations have been generated for a specific training setting and a target dataset. However, their unlearnable effects significantly decrease when used in other training settings and datasets. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel unlearnable strategy based on Classwise Separability Discriminant (CSD), which aims to better transfer the unlearnable effects to other training settings and datasets by enhancing the linear separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the transferability of the proposed unlearnable examples across training settings and datasets.}

  abstract  = {In deep learning, transferring information from a pretrained network to a downstream task by finetuning has many benefits. The choice of task head plays an important role in fine-tuning, as the pretrained and downstream tasks are usually different. Although there exist many different designs for finetuning, a full understanding of when and why these algorithms work has been elusive. We analyze how the choice of task head controls feature adaptation and hence influences the downstream performance. By decomposing the learning dynamics of adaptation, we find that the key aspect is the training accuracy and loss at the beginning of finetuning, which determines the "energy" available for the feature's adaptation.}

  abstract  = {Forward gradient learning computes a noisy directional gradient and is a biologically plausible alternative to backprop for learning deep neural networks. However, the standard forward gradient algorithm, when applied naively, suffers from high variance when the number of parameters to be learned is large. In this paper, we propose a series of architectural and algorithmic modifications that together make forward gradient learning practical for standard deep learning benchmark tasks. We show that it is possible to substantially reduce the variance of the forward gradient estimator by applying perturbations to activations rather than weights. We further improve the scalability of forward gradient by introducing a large number of local greedy loss functions, each of which involves only a small number of learnable parameters, and a new MLPMixer-inspired architecture, LocalMixer, that is more suitable for local learning. Our approach matches backprop on MNIST and CIFAR-10 and significantly outperforms previously proposed backprop-free algorithms on ImageNet.}

  abstract  = {Recently, great success has been made in learning visual representations from text supervision, facilitating the emergence of text-supervised semantic segmentation. However, existing works focus on pixel grouping and cross-modal semantic alignment, while ignoring the correspondence among multiple augmented views of the same image. To overcome such limitation, we propose multi-View Consistent learning (ViewCo) for text-supervised semantic segmentation. Specifically, we first propose text-to-views consistency modeling to learn correspondence for multiple views of the same input image. Additionally, we propose cross-view segmentation consistency modeling to address the ambiguity issue of text supervision by contrasting the segment features of Siamese visual encoders. The text-to-views consistency benefits the dense assignment of the visual features by encouraging different crops to align with the same text, while the cross-view segmentation consistency modeling provides additional self-supervision, overcoming the limitation of ambiguous text supervision for segmentation masks. Trained with large-scale image-text data, our model can directly segment objects of arbitrary categories in a zero-shot manner. Extensive experiments show that ViewCo outperforms state-of-the-art methods on average by up to 2.9%, 1.6%, and 2.4% mIoU on PASCAL VOC2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO, respectively.}

In this paper, we provide a representation view of the latent variable models for state-action value functions, which allows both tractable variational learning algorithm and effective implementation of the optimism/pessimism principle in the face of uncertainty for exploration. In particular, we propose a computationally efficient planning algorithm with UCB exploration by incorporating kernel embeddings of latent variable models.

  abstract  = {Motion mimicking is a foundational task in physics-based character animation. However, most existing motion mimicking methods are built upon reinforcement learning (RL) and suffer from heavy reward engineering, high variance, and slow convergence with hard explorations. Specifically, they usually take tens of hours or even days of training to mimic a simple motion sequence, resulting in poor scalability. In this work, we leverage differentiable physics simulators (DPS) and propose an efficient motion mimicking method dubbed DiffMimic. Our key insight is that DPS casts a complex policy learning task to a much simpler state matching problem. In particular, DPS learns a stable policy by analytical gradients with ground-truth physical priors hence leading to significantly faster and stabler convergence than RL-based methods. Moreover, to escape from local optima, we utilize a Demonstration Replay mechanism to enable stable gradient backpropagation in a long horizon. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that DiffMimic has a better sample efficiency and time efficiency than existing methods (e.g., DeepMimic). Notably, DiffMimic allows a physically simulated character to learn Backflip after 10 minutes of training and be able to cycle it after 3 hours of training, while the existing approach may require about a day of training to cycle Backflip.}

In this paper, we show that this separation is in fact algorithmic: one can learn the function constructed by Safran et al.

  abstract  = {Representation learning plays a critical role in reinforcement learning for managing the curse of dimensionality. A representative class of algorithms exploits a spectral decomposition of the stochastic transition dynamics to construct representations that enjoy strong theoretical properties in an idealized setting. However, current spectral methods suffer from limited applicability because they are constructed for state-only aggregation and derived from a policy-dependent transition kernel, without considering the issue of exploration. In this work, we propose a new spectral representation learning method that gets rid of the policy dependency and can be easily applied in downstream tasks. Our method constructs a policy-independent state-action representation by utilizing both the stochastic transition dynamics and the reward function. We show that the learned representation enjoys bounded approximation error and can be incorporated into downstream tasks through off-the-shelf algorithms. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across a variety of tasks including tabular and continuous control environments.}

Predicting these classes from data remains an essential open challenge in computational physics on which existing time-series classification methods struggle. Here, we propose, phase2vec, an embedding method that learns high-quality, physically-meaningful representations of low-dimensional dynamical systems without supervision. Our embeddings are produced by a convolutional backbone that extracts geometric features from flow data and minimizes a physically-informed vector field reconstruction loss. The trained architecture can not only predict the equations of unseen data, but also produces embeddings that encode meaningful physical properties of input data (e.g. stability of fixed points, conservation of energy, and the incompressibility of flows) more faithfully than standard blackbox classifiers and state-of-the-art time series classification techniques. We additionally apply our embeddings to the analysis of meteorological data, showing we can detect climatically meaningful features. Collectively, our results demonstrate the viability of embedding approaches for the discovery of dynamical features in physical systems.},

We interpret the solution of the forward heat equation with constant additive noise as a variational approximation in the diffusion latent variable model. Our new model shows emergent qualitative properties not seen in standard diffusion models, such as disentanglement of overall colour and shape in images. Spectral analysis on natural images highlights connections to diffusion models and reveals an implicit coarse-to-fine inductive bias in them.},

The transformer allows our world model to access previous states directly, instead of viewing them through a compressed recurrent state. By utilizing the Transformer-{XL} architecture, it is able to learn long-term dependencies while staying computationally efficient. Our transformer-based world model ({TWM}) generates meaningful, new experience, which is used to train a policy that outperforms previous model-free and model-based reinforcement learning algorithms on the Atari 100k benchmark.},

An {LLM} is conditioned on a question (without the associated answer options) and its chosen option is the one assigned the highest probability after normalization (for length, etc.). A more natural prompting approach is to present the question and answer options to the {LLM} jointly and have it output the symbol (e.g., ``A'') associated with its chosen answer option. This approach allows the model to explicitly compare answer options, reduces computational costs, and mitigates the effects of tokenization scheme and answer option representations on answer selection. For the natural approach to be effective, the {LLM} it is used with must be able to associate answer options with the symbols that represent them. The {LLM} needs what we term multiple choice symbol binding ({MCSB}) ability. This ability varies greatly by model. We show that a model with high {MCSB} ability performs much better with the natural approach than with the traditional approach across 20 diverse datasets and largely closes the gap with the {SOTA}, suggesting that the {MCQA} ability of {LLMs} has been previously underestimated.},

  abstract     = {Quantile regression ({QR}) is a powerful tool for estimating one or more conditional quantiles of a target variable Y given explanatory features X. A limitation of {QR} is that it is only defined for scalar target variables, due to the formulation of its objective function, and since the notion of quantiles has no standard definition for multivariate distributions. Recently, vector quantile regression ({VQR}) was proposed as an extension of {QR} for vector-valued target variables, thanks to a meaningful generalization of the notion of quantiles to multivariate distributions via optimal transport. Despite its elegance, {VQR} is arguably not applicable in practice due to several limitations: (i) it assumes a linear model for the quantiles of the target Y given the features X; (ii) its exact formulation is intractable even for modestly-sized problems in terms of target dimensions, number of regressed quantile levels, or number of features, and its relaxed dual formulation may violate the monotonicity of the estimated quantiles; (iii) no fast or scalable solvers for {VQR} currently exist. In this work we fully address these limitations, namely: (i) We extend {VQR} to the non-linear case, showing substantial improvement over linear {VQR}; (ii) We propose vector monotone rearrangement, a method which ensures the quantile functions estimated by {VQR} are monotone functions; (iii) We provide fast, {GPU}-accelerated solvers for linear and nonlinear {VQR} which maintain a fixed memory footprint, and demonstrate that they scale to millions of samples and thousands of quantile levels; (iv) We release an optimized python package of our solvers as to widespread the use of {VQR} in real-world applications.},

Disentanglement is one promising direction aimed at aligning a model's representation with the underlying factors generating the data (e.g. color or background). Existing disentanglement methods, however, rely on an often unrealistic assumption: that factors are statistically independent. In reality, factors (like object color and shape) are correlated. To address this limitation, we consider the use of a relaxed disentanglement criterion -- the {Hausdorff} Factorized Support ({HFS}) criterion -- that encourages only pairwise factorized support, rather than a factorial distribution, by minimizing a {Hausdorff} distance. This allows for arbitrary distributions of the factors over their support, including correlations between them. We show that the use of {HFS} consistently facilitates disentanglement and recovery of ground-truth factors across a variety of correlation settings and benchmarks, even under severe training correlations and correlation shifts, with in parts over +60\% in relative improvement over existing disentanglement methods. In addition, we find that leveraging {HFS} for representation learning can even facilitate transfer to downstream tasks such as classification under distribution shifts. We hope our original approach and positive empirical results inspire further progress on the open problem of robust generalization.},

We refrain from ensembling the representation backbone; this choice yields an efficient ensemble method that incurs a small training cost and requires no architectural changes or computational overhead to downstream evaluation.

Thorough experiments yield improved prior art baselines which our method still surpasses; e.g., our overall improvement with {MSN} {ViT-B}/16 is 3.9 p.p. for 1-shot learning.},

First, we propose novel graphical conditions that allow the imitator to learn a policy performing as well as the expert's behavior policy, even when the imitator and the expert's state-action space disagree, and unobserved confounders ({UCs}) are present. When provided with parametric knowledge about the unknown reward function, such a policy may outperform the expert's. Also, our method is easily extensible and allows one to leverage existing {IRL} algorithms even when {UCs} are present, including the multiplicative-weights algorithm ({MWAL}) (Syed \& Schapire, 2008) and the generative adversarial imitation learning ({GAIL}) (Ho \& Ermon, 2016).

  abstract     = {Recent symbolic music generative models have achieved significant improvements in the quality of the generated samples. Nevertheless, it remains hard for users to control the output in such a way that it matches their expectation. To address this limitation, high-level, human-interpretable conditioning is essential. In this work, we release {FIGARO}, a Transformer-based conditional model trained to generate symbolic music based on a sequence of high-level control codes. To this end, we propose description-to-sequence learning, which consists of automatically extracting fine-grained, human-interpretable features (the description) and training a sequence-to-sequence model to reconstruct the original sequence given only the description as input. {FIGARO} achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-track symbolic music generation both in terms of style transfer and sample quality.},

  abstract     = {End-to-end learning for visual robotic manipulation is known to suffer from sample inefficiency, requiring large numbers of demonstrations. The spatial roto-translation equivariance, or the {SE}(3)-equivariance can be exploited to improve the sample efficiency for learning robotic manipulation. In this paper, we present {SE}(3)-equivariant models for visual robotic manipulation from point clouds that can be trained fully end-to-end. By utilizing the representation theory of the Lie group, we construct novel {SE}(3)-equivariant energy-based models that allow highly sample efficient end-to-end learning. We show that our models can learn from scratch without prior knowledge and yet are highly sample efficient (5-10 demonstrations are enough). Furthermore, we show that our models can generalize to tasks with (i) previously unseen target object poses, (ii) previously unseen target object instances of the category, and (iii) previously unseen visual distractors. We experiment with 6-DoF robotic manipulation tasks to validate our models' sample efficiency and generalizability.},

  abstract     = {Current abstractive summarization models either suffer from a lack of clear interpretability or provide incomplete rationales by only highlighting parts of the source document. To this end, we propose the Summarization Program ({SP}), an interpretable modular framework consisting of an (ordered) list of binary trees, each encoding the step-by-step generative process of an abstractive summary sentence from the source document. A Summarization Program contains one root node per summary sentence, and a distinct tree connects each summary sentence (root node) to the document sentences (leaf nodes) from which it is derived, with the connecting nodes containing intermediate generated sentences. Edges represent different modular operations involved in summarization such as sentence fusion, compression, and paraphrasing. We first propose an efficient best-first search method over neural modules, {SP}-Search that identifies {SPs} for human summaries by directly optimizing for {ROUGE} scores. Next, using these programs as automatic supervision, we propose seq2seq models that generate Summarization Programs, which are then executed to obtain final summaries. We demonstrate that {SP}-Search effectively represents the generative process behind human summaries using modules that are typically faithful to their intended behavior. We also conduct a simulation study to show that Summarization Programs improve the interpretability of summarization models by allowing humans to better simulate model reasoning. Summarization Programs constitute a promising step toward interpretable and modular abstractive summarization, a complex task previously addressed primarily through blackbox end-to-end neural systems.},

  abstract     = {The ability to discover behaviours from past experience and transfer them to new tasks is a hallmark of intelligent agents acting sample-efficiently in the real world. Equipping embodied reinforcement learners with the same ability may be crucial for their successful deployment in robotics. While hierarchical and {KL}-regularized reinforcement learning individually hold promise here, arguably a hybrid approach could combine their respective benefits. Key to these fields is the use of information asymmetry across architectural modules to bias which skills are learnt. While asymmetry choice has a large influence on transferability, existing methods base their choice primarily on intuition in a domain-independent, potentially sub-optimal, manner. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically show the crucial expressivity-transferability trade-off of skills across sequential tasks, controlled by information asymmetry. Given this insight, we introduce Attentive Priors for Expressive and Transferable Skills ({APES}), a hierarchical {KL}-regularized method, heavily benefiting from both priors and hierarchy. Unlike existing approaches, {APES} automates the choice of asymmetry by learning it in a data-driven, domain-dependent, way based on our expressivity-transferability theorems. Experiments over complex transfer domains of varying levels of extrapolation and sparsity, such as robot block stacking, demonstrate the criticality of the correct asymmetric choice, with {APES} drastically outperforming previous methods.},

Existing methods adapt curricula independently over either environment parameters (in single-agent settings) or co-player policies (in multi-agent settings). However, the strengths and weaknesses of co-players can manifest themselves differently depending on environmental features. It is thus crucial to consider the dependency between the environment and co-player when shaping a curriculum in multi-agent domains. In this work, we use this insight and extend Unsupervised Environment Design ({UED}) to multi-agent environments. We then introduce Multi-Agent Environment Design Strategist for Open-Ended Learning ({MAESTRO}), the first multi-agent {UED} approach for two-player zero-sum settings. {MAESTRO} efficiently produces adversarial, joint curricula over both environments and co-players and attains minimax-regret guarantees at Nash equilibrium.

  abstract     = {Discovering causal relations from observational data becomes possible with additional assumptions such as considering the functional relations to be constrained as nonlinear with additive noise ({ANM}). Even with strong assumptions, causal discovery involves an expensive search problem over the space of directed acyclic graphs ({DAGs}). Topological ordering approaches reduce the optimisation space of causal discovery by searching over a permutation rather than graph space. For {ANMs}, the Hessian of the data log-likelihood can be used for finding leaf nodes in a causal graph, allowing its topological ordering. However, existing computational methods for obtaining the Hessian still do not scale as the number of variables and the number of samples are increased. Therefore, inspired by recent innovations in diffusion probabilistic models ({DPMs}), we propose DiffAN, a topological ordering algorithm that leverages {DPMs} for learning a Hessian function. We introduce theory for updating the learned Hessian without re-training the neural network, and we show that computing with a subset of samples gives an accurate approximation of the ordering, which allows scaling to datasets with more samples and variables. We show empirically that our method scales exceptionally well to datasets with up to 500 nodes and up to $10^5$ samples while still performing on par over small datasets with state-of-the-art causal discovery methods.},

We find that when the pre-training data meets certain criteria---it is sufficiently large and contains descriptive captions with low variability----image-only methods do not match {CLIP}'s performance even when they are trained with more image data. However, contrary to what one might expect, there are practical settings in which these criteria are not met, wherein added supervision through captions is actually detrimental.

To enable systematic exploration of the reasoning ability of {LLMs}, we present a new synthetic question-answering dataset called {PrOntoQA}, where each example is generated from a synthetic world model represented in first-order logic. This allows us to parse the generated chain-of-thought into symbolic proofs for formal analysis. Our analysis on {InstructGPT} and {GPT}-3 shows that {LLMs} are quite capable of making correct individual deduction steps, and so are generally capable of reasoning, even in fictional contexts. However, they have difficulty with proof planning: When multiple valid deduction steps are available, they are not able to systematically explore the different options.},

Accurately differentiating open set samples and those from a minority class in the closed set poses a fundamental challenge as the model may be equally uncertain when recognizing samples from the minority class. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Robust Evidential Optimization ({AREO}) that offers a principled way to quantify sample uncertainty through evidential learning while optimally balancing the model training over all classes in the closed set through adaptive distributively robust optimization ({DRO}). To avoid the model to primarily focus on the most difficult samples by following the standard {DRO}, adaptive {DRO} training is performed, which is governed by a novel multi-scheduler learning mechanism to ensure optimal model performance.},

This alludes to a different error-based learning mechanism in the brain. Unlike {DNNs}, where learning scales linearly with the magnitude of the error, the sensitivity to errors in the brain decreases as a function of their magnitude. To this end, we propose "{ESMER}" which employs a principled mechanism to modulate error sensitivity in a dual-memory rehearsal-based system. Concretely, it maintains a memory of past errors and uses it to modify the learning dynamics so that the model learns more from small consistent errors compared to large sudden errors. We complement this with "Error-Sensitive Reservoir Sampling" to maintain episodic memory, which leverages the error history to pre-select low-loss samples.},

Our proposed architecture leverages this structure by separately learning approximations for the low-dimensional factors and a subsequent combination. After developing the approach as a general framework, we apply it to a shape space of triangular surfaces.

  abstract     = {Textual content is often the output of a collaborative writing process: We start with an initial draft, ask for suggestions, and repeatedly make changes. Agnostic of this process, today's language models are trained to generate only the final result. As a consequence, they lack several abilities crucial for collaborative writing: They are unable to update existing texts, difficult to control and incapable of verbally planning or explaining their actions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce PEER, a collaborative language model that is trained to imitate the entire writing process itself. PEER can write drafts, add suggestions, propose edits and provide explanations for its actions. Crucially, we train multiple instances of PEER able to infill various parts of the writing process, enabling the use of self-training techniques for increasing the quality, amount and diversity of training data.},

  abstract     = {A central task in computational drug discovery is to construct models from known active molecules to find further promising molecules for subsequent screening. However, typically only very few active molecules are known. Therefore, few-shot learning methods have the potential to improve the effectiveness of this critical phase of the drug discovery process. We introduce a new method for few-shot drug discovery. Its main idea is to enrich a molecule representation by knowledge about known context or reference molecules. Our novel concept for molecule representation enrichment is to associate molecules from both the support set and the query set with a large set of reference (context) molecules through a modern Hopfield network. Intuitively, this enrichment step is analogous to a human expert who would associate a given molecule with familiar molecules whose properties are known.},

Even though the domain has received a considerable amount of attention in the past years, most methods present the common drawback of lacking theoretical guarantees. Our starting point is to notice that the estimate of the risk that most discriminative SSL methods minimise is biased, even asymptotically. This bias impedes the use of standard statistical learning theory and can hurt empirical performance. We propose a simple way of removing the bias. Our debiasing approach is straightforward to implement and applicable to most deep SSL methods. In particular, we provide generalisation error bounds for the proposed methods. We evaluate debiased versions of different existing SSL methods, such as the Pseudo-label method and Fixmatch, and show that debiasing can compete with classic deep SSL techniques in various settings by providing better calibrated models.},

Localized smoothing Pareto-dominates existing certificates on both image segmentation and node classification tasks, simultaneously offering higher accuracy and stronger certificates.},

This is supported by our finding that common exploration noise strategies are inadequate in synthetic examples of overactuated systems. We identify differential extrinsic plasticity (DEP), a method from the domain of self-organization, as being able to induce state-space covering exploration within seconds of interaction. By integrating DEP into RL, we achieve fast learning of reaching and locomotion in musculoskeletal systems, outperforming current approaches in all considered tasks in sample efficiency and robustness.},

Recent work assumes the approximation error on the weights is a proxy for the performance of the model to compress multiple layers and fine-tune the compressed model. Surprisingly, little research has systematically evaluated which approximation errors can be used to make choices regarding the layer, tensor decomposition method, and level of compression. To close this gap, we perform an experimental study to test if this assumption holds across different layers and types of decompositions, and what the effect of fine-tuning is. We include the approximation error on the features resulting from a compressed layer in our analysis to test if this provides a better proxy, as it explicitly takes the data into account.},

Specifically, we consider mini-batch k-means which terminates only when the improvement in the quality of the clustering on the sampled batch is below some threshold. Although at first glance it appears that this algorithm might execute forever, we answer the above question in the affirmative and show that if the batch is of size $\Omega((d/\epsilon)^2)$, it must terminate within $O(d/\epsilon)$ iterations with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension of the input, and $\epsilon$ is a threshold parameter for termination. This is true regardless of how the centers are initialized. When the algorithm is initialized with the k-means++ initialization scheme, it achieves an approximation ratio of $O(\log k)$ (the same as the full-batch version).},

In this work, we overcome this limitation by showing that reconstructing features from models trained in a self-supervised manner is a sufficient training signal for object-centric representations to arise in a fully unsupervised way. Our approach, DINOSAUR, significantly out-performs existing image-based object-centric learning models on simulated data and is the first unsupervised object-centric model that scales to real-world datasets such as COCO and PASCAL VOC. DINOSAUR is conceptually simple and shows competitive performance compared to more involved pipelines from the computer vision literature.},

In this study, we realize energy-efficient neural networks by exploiting a multiplication-less, sparse dot-product. We first reformulate a dot-product between an integer weight and activation into an equivalent operation comprised of additions followed by bit-shifts. In this formulation, the number of addition operations equals the number of bits of the integer weight in binary format. Leveraging this observation, we propose Bit-Pruning, which removes unnecessary bits in each weight value during training to reduce the energy consumption. Bit-Pruning can be seen as soft Weight-Pruning as it prunes bits, not the whole weight element.},

To mitigate device heterogeneity, a common approach is to use masking. In this paper, we first show that using random masking can lead to a bias in the obtained solution of the learning model. To this end, we propose a personalized FL algorithm with optimized masking vectors called PerFedMask. In particular, PerFedMask facilitates each device to obtain its optimized masking vector based on its computational capability before training. Fine-tuning is performed after training. PerFedMask is a generalization of a recently proposed personalized FL algorithm, FedBABU. PerFedMask can be combined with other FL algorithms including HeteroFL and Split-Mix FL. Results based on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets show that the proposed PerFedMask algorithm provides a higher test accuracy after fine-tuning and lower average number of trainable parameters when compared with six existing state-of-the-art FL algorithms in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Training machine learning models robust to distribution shifts is critical for real-world applications. Some robust training algorithms (e.g., Group DRO) specialize to group shifts and require group information on all training points. Other methods (e.g., CVaR DRO) that do not need group annotations can be overly conservative, since they naively upweight high loss points which may form a contrived set that does not correspond to any meaningful group in the real world (e.g., when the high loss points are randomly mislabeled training points). In this work, we address limitations in prior approaches by assuming a more nuanced form of group shift: conditioned on the label, we assume that the true group function (indicator over group) is simple. For example, we may expect that group shifts occur along low bitrate features (e.g., image background, lighting). Thus, we aim to learn a model that maintains high accuracy on simple group functions realized by these low bitrate features, that need not spend valuable model capacity achieving high accuracy on contrived groups of examples. Based on this, we consider the two-player game formulation of DRO where the adversary's capacity is bitrate-constrained. Our resulting practical algorithm, Bitrate-Constrained DRO (\bdro), does not require group information on training samples yet matches the performance of Group DRO on datasets that have training group annotations and that of CVaR DRO on long-tailed distributions. Our theoretical analysis reveals that in some settings \bdro objective can provably yield statistically efficient and less conservative solutions than unconstrained CVaR DRO.},

We show that a simple modification of deep Q-learning largely alleviates these issues. By combining bang-bang action discretization with value decomposition, framing single-agent control as cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), this simple critic-only approach matches performance of state-of-the-art continuous actor-critic methods when learning from features or pixels. We extend classical bandit examples from cooperative MARL to provide intuition for how decoupled critics leverage state information to coordinate joint optimization, and demonstrate surprisingly strong performance across a variety of continuous control tasks.},

Task-specialized approaches for training regression networks have shown significant improvement over generic approaches, such as direct regression. More recently, a generic approach based on regression by binary classification using binary-encoded labels has shown significant improvement over direct regression. The space of label encodings for regression is large. Lacking heretofore have been automated approaches to find a good label encoding for a given application. This paper introduces Regularized Label Encoding Learning (RLEL) for end-to-end training of an entire network and its label encoding. RLEL provides a generic approach for tackling regression. Underlying RLEL is our observation that the search space of label encodings can be constrained and efficiently explored by using a continuous search space of real-valued label encodings combined with a regularization function designed to encourage encodings with certain properties. These properties balance the probability of classification error in individual bits against error correction capability. Label encodings found by RLEL result in lower or comparable errors to manually designed label encodings. Applying RLEL results in 10.9% and 12.4% improvement in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) over direct regression and multiclass classification, respectively. Our evaluation demonstrates that RLEL can be combined with off-the-shelf feature extractors and is suitable across different architectures, datasets, and tasks.},

We address these issues by instead providing a certificate that demonstrates that the learning algorithm itself is fair, and hence, as a consequence, so too is the trained model. We introduce a method to provide a confidential proof of fair training for widely used decision trees, which we term Confidential-PROFITT. We propose novel fair decision tree learning algorithms along with customized zero-knowledge proof protocols to obtain a proof of fairness that can be audited by a third party. Using zero-knowledge proofs enables us to guarantee confidentiality of both the model and its training data. We show empirically that bounding the information gain of each node with respect to the sensitive attributes reduces the unfairness of the final tree. In extensive experiments on the COMPAS, Communities and Crime, Default Credit, and Adult datasets, we demonstrate that a company can use Confidential-PROFITT to certify the fairness of their decision tree to an auditor in less than 2 minutes.},

  abstract     = {Recent works have shown that large models pretrained on common visual learning tasks can provide useful representations for a wide range of specialized perception problems, as well as a variety of robotic manipulation tasks. While prior work on robotic manipulation has predominantly used frozen pretrained features, we demonstrate that in robotics this approach can fail to reach optimal performance, and that fine-tuning of the full model can lead to significantly better results. Unfortunately, fine-tuning disrupts the pretrained visual representation, and causes representational drift towards the fine-tuned task thus leading to a loss of the versatility of the original model. We introduce 'lossless adaptation' to address this shortcoming of classical fine-tuning. We demonstrate that appropriate placement of our parameter efficient adapters can significantly reduce the performance gap between frozen pretrained representations and full end-to-end fine-tuning without changes to the original representation and thus preserving original capabilities of the pretrained model. We perform a comprehensive investigation across three major model architectures (ViTs, NFNets, and ResNets), supervised (ImageNet-1K classification) and self-supervised pretrained weights (CLIP, BYOL, Visual MAE) in 3 task domains and 35 individual tasks, and demonstrate that our claims are strongly validated in various settings.},

  abstract     = {We present a method to map 2D image observations of a scene to a persistent 3D scene representation, enabling novel view synthesis and disentangled representation of the movable and immovable components of the scene. Motivated by the bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation commonly used in vision and robotics, we propose conditional neural groundplans, ground-aligned 2D feature grids, as persistent and memory-efficient scene representations. Our method is trained self-supervised from unlabeled multi-view observations using differentiable rendering, and learns to complete geometry and appearance of occluded regions. In addition, we show that we can leverage multi-view videos at training time to learn to separately reconstruct static and movable components of the scene from a single image at test time. The ability to separately reconstruct movable objects enables a variety of downstream tasks using simple heuristics, such as extraction of object-centric 3D representations, novel view synthesis, instance-level segmentation, 3D bounding box prediction, and scene editing. This highlights the value of neural groundplans as a backbone for efficient 3D scene understanding models.},

  abstract     = {Repeated parameter sharing in federated learning causes significant information leakage about private data, thus defeating its main purpose: data privacy. Mitigating the risk of this information leakage, using state of the art differentially private algorithms, also does not come for free. Randomized mechanisms can prevent convergence of models on learning even the useful representation functions, especially if there is more disagreement between local models on the classification functions (due to data heterogeneity). In this paper, we consider a representation federated learning objective that encourages various parties to collaboratively refine the consensus part of the model, with differential privacy guarantees, while separately allowing sufficient freedom for local personalization (without releasing it). We prove that in the linear representation setting, while the objective is non-convex, our proposed new algorithm DPFEDREP converges to a ball centered around the global optimal solution at a linear rate, and the radius of the ball is proportional to the reciprocal of the privacy budget. With this novel utility analysis, we improve the SOTA utility-privacy trade-off for this problem by a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the input dimension. We empirically evaluate our method with the image classification task on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and EMNIST, and observe a significant performance improvement over the prior work under the same small privacy budget.},

Utilizing the symmetry, our method can find a shadowing representative of the true assignment and the number of tested assignments in the alternative is largely reduced. In theory, we introduce a combinatorial distance between two community classes and show a combinatorial-probabilistic trade-off phenomenon. Our test is honest as long as the product of the combinatorial distance between two communities and the probabilistic distance between two connection probabilities is sufficiently large. Besides, we show that such trade-off also exists in the information-theoretic lower bound. We also implement numerical experiments to show the validity of our method.},

A recent line of work, detection-based defense, aims to distinguish adversarial sentences from benign ones. However, the core limitation of previous detection methods is being incapable of giving correct predictions on adversarial sentences unlike defense methods from other paradigms. To solve this issue, this paper proposes TextShield: (1) we discover a link between text attack and saliency information, and then we propose a saliency-based detector, which can effectively detect whether an input sentence is adversarial or not. (2) We design a saliency-based corrector, which converts the detected adversary sentences to benign ones. By combining the saliency-based detector and corrector, TextShield extends the detection-only paradigm to a detection-correction paradigm, thus filling the gap in the existing detection-based defense. Comprehensive experiments show that (a) TextShield consistently achieves higher or comparable performance than state-of-the-art defense methods across various attacks on different benchmarks. (b) our saliency-based detector outperforms existing detectors for detecting adversarial sentences.},

Existing methods for solving this problem have a variety of limitations, such as cannot prevent the happening of architecture degeneration, being excessively restrictive in setting the number of skip connections, etc. To address these limitations, we propose a new approach for improving the generalizability and stability of differentiable NAS, by developing a transferability-encouraging tri-level optimization framework which improves the architecture of a main model by encouraging good transferability to an auxiliary model. Our framework involves three stages performed end-to-end: 1) train network weights of a main model; 2) transfer knowledge from the main model to an auxiliary model; 3) optimize the architecture of the main model by maximizing its transferability to the auxiliary model. We propose a new knowledge transfer approach based on matching quadruple relative similarities. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

In this work, we propose using large-scale retrieval methods, in particular, efficient k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN), which offers novel capabilities: (1) training a substantially small and efficient text-to-image diffusion model using only pre-trained multi-modal embeddings, but without an explicit text-image dataset, (2) generating out-of-distribution images by simply swapping the retrieval database at inference time, and (3) performing text-driven local semantic manipulations while preserving object identity. To demonstrate the robustness of our method, we apply our kNN approach on two state-of-the-art diffusion backbones, and show results on several different datasets. As evaluated by human studies and automatic metrics, our method achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing approaches that train text-to-image generation models using images-only dataset.},

There are two key desiderata for the representation: label efficiency (the ability to learn an accurate classifier on top of the representation with a small amount of labeled data) and universality (usefulness across a wide range of downstream tasks). In this paper, we focus on one of the most popular instantiations of this paradigm: contrastive learning with linear probing, i.e., learning a linear predictor on the representation pre-trained by contrastive learning. We show that there exists a trade-off between the two desiderata so that one may not be able to achieve both simultaneously. Specifically, we provide analysis using a theoretical data model and show that, while more diverse pre-training data result in more diverse features for different tasks (improving universality), it puts less emphasis on task-specific features, giving rise to larger sample complexity for down-stream supervised tasks, and thus worse prediction performance. Guided by this analysis, we propose a contrastive regularization method to improve the trade-off. We validate our analysis and method empirically with systematic experiments using real-world datasets and foundation models.},

We understand a scene by decomposing the scene into different concepts (e.g., shape and position of an object) and learning the respective laws of these concepts, which may be either natural (e.g., laws of motion) or man-made (e.g., laws of a game). The automatic parsing of these laws indicates the model's ability to understand the scene, which makes law parsing play a central role in many visual tasks. This paper proposes a deep latent variable model for Compositional LAw Parsing (CLAP), which achieves the human-like compositionality ability through an encoding-decoding architecture to represent concepts in the scene as latent variables. CLAP employs concept-specific latent random functions instantiated with Neural Processes to capture the law of concepts. Our experimental results demonstrate that CLAP outperforms the baseline methods in multiple visual tasks such as intuitive physics, abstract visual reasoning, and scene representation. The law manipulation experiments illustrate CLAP's interpretability by modifying specific latent random functions on samples. For example, CLAP learns the laws of position-changing and appearance constancy from the moving balls in a scene, making it possible to exchange laws between samples or compose existing laws into novel laws.},

In this paper, we propose a new approach that generalizes symbolic regression to graph-structured physical mechanisms. The essence of our method is to model the formula skeleton with a message-passing flow, which helps transform the discovery of the skeleton into the search for the message-passing flow. Such a transformation guarantees that we are able to search a message-passing flow, which is efficient and Pareto-optimal in terms of both accuracy and simplicity. Subsequently, the underneath formulas can be identified by interpreting component functions of the searched message-passing flow, reusing classical symbolic regression methods.},

As such, there is a lack of insight on the robustness of the representations learned from unsupervised methods, such as self-supervised learning (SSL) and auto-encoder based algorithms (AE), to distribution shift. We posit that the input-driven objectives of unsupervised algorithms lead to representations that are more robust to distribution shift than the target-driven objective of SL. We verify this by extensively evaluating the performance of SSL and AE on both synthetic and realistic distribution shift datasets. Following observations that the linear layer used for classification itself can be susceptible to spurious correlations, we evaluate the representations using a linear head trained on a small amount of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, to isolate the robustness of the learned representations from that of the linear head. We also develop "controllable" versions of existing realistic domain generalisation datasets with adjustable degrees of distribution shifts. This allows us to study the robustness of different learning algorithms under versatile yet realistic distribution shift conditions. Our experiments show that representations learned from unsupervised learning algorithms generalise better than SL under a wide variety of extreme as well as realistic distribution shifts.},

In this paper, we propose a general framework named Moral Awareness Adaptive Learning (MorAL) that enhances the morality capacity of an agent using a plugin moral-aware learning model. The framework allows the agent to execute task learning and morality learning adaptively. The agent selects trajectories from past experiences during task learning. Meanwhile, the trajectories are used to conduct self-imitation learning with a moral-enhanced objective. In order to achieve the trade-off between morality and task progress, the agent uses the combination of task policy and moral policy for action selection. We evaluate on the Jiminy Cricket benchmark, a set of text-based games with various scenes and dense morality annotations. Our experiments demonstrate that, compared with strong contemporary value alignment approaches, the proposed framework improves task performance while reducing immoral behaviours in various games.},

However, training GNNs on large-scale graphs suffers from the well-known neighbor explosion problem, i.e., the exponentially increasing dependencies of nodes with the number of message passing layers. Subgraph-wise sampling methods---a promising class of mini-batch training techniques---discard messages outside the mini-batches in backward passes to avoid the neighbor explosion problem at the expense of gradient estimation accuracy. This poses significant challenges to their convergence analysis and convergence speeds, which seriously limits their reliable real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel subgraph-wise sampling method with a convergence guarantee, namely Local Message Compensation (LMC). To the best of our knowledge, LMC is the first subgraph-wise sampling method with provable convergence. The key idea of LMC is to retrieve the discarded messages in backward passes based on a message passing formulation of backward passes. By efficient and effective compensations for the discarded messages in both forward and backward passes, LMC computes accurate mini-batch gradients and thus accelerates convergence. We further show that LMC converges to first-order stationary points of GNNs. Experiments on large-scale benchmark tasks demonstrate that LMC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art subgraph-wise sampling methods in terms of efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Switching costs, which capture the costs for changing policies, are regarded as a critical metric in reinforcement learning (RL), in addition to the standard metric of losses (or rewards). However, existing studies on switching costs (with a coefficient β that is strictly positive and is independent of T) have mainly focused on static RL, where the loss distribution is assumed to be fixed during the learning process, and thus practical scenarios where the loss distribution could be non-stationary or even adversarial are not considered. While adversarial RL better models this type of practical scenarios, an open problem remains: how to develop a provably efficient algorithm for adversarial RL with switching costs? This paper makes the first effort towards solving this problem. First, we provide a regret lower-bound that shows that the regret of any algorithm must be larger than Ω̃((HSA)^{1/3}T^{2/3}), where T, S, A and H are the number of episodes, states, actions and layers in each episode, respectively. Our lower bound indicates that, due to the fundamental challenge of switching costs in adversarial RL, the best achieved regret (whose dependency on T is Õ(√T)) in static RL with switching costs (as well as adversarial RL without switching costs) is no longer achievable. Moreover, we propose two novel switching-reduced algorithms with regrets that match our lower bound when the transition function is known, and match our lower bound within a small factor of Õ(H^{1/3}) when the transition function is unknown. Our regret analysis demonstrates the near-optimal performance of them.},

However, our empirical study shows that "gradient surgery" cannot effectively reduce the occurrence of conflicting gradients. In this paper, we take a different approach to reduce conflicting gradients from the root. In essence, we investigate the task gradients w.r.t. each shared network layer, select the layers with high conflict scores, and turn them to task-specific layers. Our experiments show that such a simple approach can greatly reduce the occurrence of conflicting gradients in the remaining shared layers and achieve better performance, with only a slight increase in model parameters in many cases.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning aims to train models collaboratively across different clients without the sharing of data for privacy considerations. However, one major challenge for this learning paradigm is the data heterogeneity problem, which refers to the discrepancies between the local data distributions among various clients. To tackle this problem, we first study how data heterogeneity affects the representations of the globally aggregated models. Interestingly, we find that heterogeneous data results in the global model suffering from severe dimensional collapse, in which representations tend to reside in a lower-dimensional space instead of the ambient space. Moreover, we observe a similar phenomenon on models locally trained on each client and deduce that the dimensional collapse on the global model is inherited from local models. In addition, we theoretically analyze the gradient flow dynamics to shed light on how data heterogeneity result in dimensional collapse for local models. To remedy this problem caused by the data heterogeneity, we propose FedDecorr, a novel method that can effectively mitigate dimensional collapse in federated learning. Specifically, FedDecorr applies a regularization term during local training that encourages different dimensions of representations to be uncorrelated. FedDecorr, which is implementation-friendly and computationally-efficient, yields consistent improvements over baselines on standard benchmark datasets.},

In this paper, we propose a new approach capable of protein sequence and structure co-design, which iteratively translates both protein sequence and structure into the desired state from random initialization, based on context features given a priori. Our model consists of a trigonometry-aware encoder that reasons geometrical constraints and interactions from context features, and a roto-translation equivariant decoder that translates protein sequence and structure interdependently. Notably, all protein amino acids are updated in one shot in each translation step, which significantly accelerates the inference process. Experimental results across multiple tasks show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin, and is able to design proteins of high fidelity as regards both sequence and structure, with running time orders of magnitude less than sampling-based methods.},

  abstract     = {A recent focal area in the space of graph neural networks (GNNs) is graph self-supervised learning (SSL), which aims to derive useful node representations without labeled data. Notably, many state-of-the-art graph SSL methods are contrastive methods, which use a combination of positive and negative samples to learn node representations. Owing to challenges in negative sampling (slowness and model sensitivity), recent literature introduced non-contrastive methods, which instead only use positive samples. Though such methods have shown promising performance in node-level tasks, their suitability for link prediction tasks, which are concerned with predicting link existence between pairs of nodes (and have broad applicability to recommendation systems contexts) is yet unexplored. In this work, we extensively evaluate the performance of existing non-contrastive methods for link prediction in both transductive and inductive settings. While most existing non-contrastive methods perform poorly overall, we find that, surprisingly, BGRL generally performs well in transductive settings. However, it performs poorly in the more realistic inductive settings where the model has to generalize to links to/from unseen nodes. We find that non-contrastive models tend to overfit to the training graph and use this analysis to propose T-BGRL, a novel non-contrastive framework that incorporates cheap corruptions to improve the generalization ability of the model. This simple modification strongly improves inductive performance in 5/6 of our datasets, with up to a 120% improvement in Hits@50--all with comparable speed to other non-contrastive baselines and up to 14x faster than the best-performing contrastive baseline. Our work imparts interesting findings about non-contrastive learning for link prediction and paves the way for future researchers to further expand upon this area.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic benchmarks interweave model fitting and data collection in an attempt to mitigate the limitations of static benchmarks. In contrast to an extensive theoretical and empirical study of the static setting, the dynamic counterpart lags behind due to limited empirical studies and no apparent theoretical foundation to date. Responding to this deficit, we initiate a theoretical study of dynamic benchmarking. We examine two realizations, one capturing current practice and the other modeling more complex settings. In the first model, where data collection and model fitting alternate sequentially, we prove that model performance improves initially but can stall after only three rounds. Label noise arising from, for instance, annotator disagreement leads to even stronger negative results. Our second model generalizes the first to the case where data collection and model fitting have a hierarchical dependency structure.},

  abstract     = {Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, in which the derivative is unavailable, has recently succeeded in many important machine learning applications. Existing algorithms rely on finite difference (FD) methods for derivative estimation and gradient descent (GD)-based approaches for optimization. However, these algorithms suffer from query inefficiency because many additional function queries are required for derivative estimation in their every GD update, which typically hinders their deployment in real-world applications where every function query is expensive. Based on these two contributions, we introduce the zeroth-order optimization with trajectory-informed derivative estimation (ZoRD) algorithm for query-efficient ZO optimization. We theoretically demonstrate that our trajectory-informed derivative estimation and our ZoRD algorithm improve over existing approaches, which is then supported by our real-world experiments such as black-box adversarial attack, non-differentiable metric optimization, and derivative-free reinforcement learning.},

In practice, model-based neural networks exhibit higher generalization capability compared to ReLU neural networks. However, this phenomenon was not addressed theoretically. Here, we leverage complexity measures including the global and local Rademacher complexities, in order to provide upper bounds on the generalization and estimation errors of model-based networks. We demonstrate through a series of experiments that our theoretical insights shed light on a few behaviours experienced in practice, including the fact that ISTA and ADMM networks exhibit higher generalization abilities (especially for small number of training samples), compared to ReLU networks.},

Commercialized {API}s such as {O}pen{AI} {GPT}-3 further increase their use in real-world language applications. However, the crucial problem of how to improve the reliability of {GPT}-3 is still under-explored. While reliability is a broad and vaguely defined term, we decompose reliability into four main facets that correspond to the existing framework of {ML} safety and are well-recognized to be important: generalizability, social biases, calibration, and factuality. Our core contribution is to establish simple and effective prompts that improve {GPT}-3's reliability as it: 1) generalizes out-of-distribution, 2) balances demographic distribution and uses natural language instructions to reduce social biases, 3) calibrates output probabilities, and 4) updates the {LLM}'s factual knowledge and reasoning chains. With appropriate prompts, {GPT}-3 is more reliable than smaller-scale supervised models on all these facets. We release all processed datasets, evaluation scripts, and model predictions. Our systematic empirical study not only sheds new insights on the reliability of prompting {LLM}s, but more importantly, our prompting strategies can help practitioners more reliably use {LLM}s like {GPT}-3.},

In this paper, we study graph compression to reduce the storage requirement for {GNN} in serving. Given a {GNN} model to be served, we propose to construct a compressed graph with a smaller number of nodes. In serving time, one just needs to replace the original training set graph by this compressed graph, without the need of changing the actual {GNN} model and the forward pass. We carefully analyze the error in the forward pass and derive simple ways to construct the compressed graph to minimize the approximation error. Experimental results on semi-supervised node classification demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the serving space requirement for {GNN} inference.},

Existing methods for dealing with these challenges tend to make strong assumptions about the particular issues at play, and often require a priori knowledge or metadata such as domain labels. Our work is orthogonal to these methods: we instead focus on providing a unified and efficient framework for {M}etadata {A}rchaeology --- uncovering and inferring metadata of examples in a dataset. We curate different subsets of data that might exist in a dataset (e.g. mislabeled, atypical, or out-of-distribution examples) using simple transformations, and leverage differences in learning dynamics between these probe suites to infer metadata of interest.},

Across these diverse applications, the overwhelming majority of work relies on N-grams. Limited efforts have been made to evaluate how well N-gram methods perform, in part because it is unclear how one could create an unbiased evaluation dataset for a massive corpus. This study uses the unique timeliness of historical news wires to create a 27,210 document dataset, with 122,876 positive duplicate pairs, for studying noise-robust de-duplication. The time-sensitivity of news makes comprehensive hand labelling feasible --- despite the massive overall size of the corpus --- as duplicates occur within a narrow date range. We develop and evaluate a range of de-duplication methods and demonstrate that a neural approach can identify many near duplicates missed by hashing, in the presence of various types of noise.},

We refer to these new generative autoencoders as {A}uto{E}ncoders within {F}lows ({AEF}), since the encoder and decoder are defined as affine layers of an overall invertible architecture. This results in a deterministic encoding of the data, as opposed to the stochastic encoding of {VAE}s. The paper introduces two related families of {AEF}s. The first family relies on a partition of the ambient space and is trained by exact maximum-likelihood. The second family exploits a deterministic expansion of the ambient space and is trained by maximizing the log-probability in this extended space. This latter case leaves complete freedom in the choice of encoder, decoder and prior architectures, making it a drop-in replacement for the training of existing {VAE}s and {VAE}-style models. We show that {AEF}s can have strikingly higher performance than architecturally identical {VAE}s in terms of log-likelihood and sample quality, especially for low dimensional latent spaces, and {AEF} samples are substantially sharper than {VAE} samples.},

Our formulation is inspired by many practical scenarios where coarse approximations of the expensive similarity metric can be efficiently obtained via weaker models. We develop a theoretically motivated algorithm in this setting that leverages the cheap oracle to judiciously query the strong oracle while maintaining high clustering quality. We empirically demonstrate gains in query minimization and clustering metrics on a variety of datasets with diverse strong and cheap oracles.},

While token-like structured knowledge representations are naturally provided in text, it is elusive how to obtain them for unstructured modalities such as scene images. In this paper, we propose a neural mechanism called {N}eural {S}ystematic {B}inder or {S}ys{B}inder for constructing a novel structured representation called {B}lock-{S}lot {R}epresentation. In {B}lock-{S}lot {R}epresentation, object-centric representations known as slots are constructed by composing a set of independent factor representations called blocks, to facilitate systematic generalization. {S}ys{B}inder obtains this structure in an unsupervised way by alternatingly applying two different binding principles: spatial binding for spatial modularity across the full scene and factor binding for factor modularity within an object. We show that {S}ys{B}inder is simple, deterministic, and general purpose, and can be applied as a drop-in module to any arbitrary neural network and on any modality. Experiments show that {S}ys{B}inder is significantly better than conventional object-centric methods at providing disentangled factor representations within the slots. We also show that {S}ys{B}inder can preserve factor-level systematic generalization in downstream tasks such as visual reasoning and scene generation.},

The choice of noising process, or inference diffusion process, affects both likelihoods and sample quality. For example, extending the inference process with auxiliary variables leads to improved sample quality. While there are many such multivariate diffusions to explore, each new one requires significant model-specific analysis, hindering rapid prototyping and evaluation. In this work, we study {M}ultivariate {D}iffusion {M}odels ({MDM}s). For any number of auxiliary variables, we provide a recipe for maximizing a lower-bound on the {MDM}s likelihood without requiring any model-specific analysis. We then demonstrate how to parameterize the diffusion for a specified target noise distribution; these two points together enable optimizing the inference diffusion process. Optimizing the diffusion expands easy experimentation from just a few well-known processes to an automatic search over all linear diffusions. To demonstrate these ideas, we introduce two new specific diffusions as well as learn a diffusion process on the {MNIST}, {CIFAR}10, and {I}mage{N}et32 datasets. We show learned {MDM}s match or surpass bits-per-dims ({BPD}s) relative to fixed choices of diffusions for a given dataset and model architecture.},

Empirically, our part-based models achieve both higher accuracy and higher adversarial robustness than a {ResNet-50} baseline on all three datasets. For instance, the clean accuracy of our part models is up to 15 percentage points higher than the baseline's, given the same level of robustness. Our experiments indicate that these models also reduce texture bias and yield better robustness against common corruptions and spurious correlations.},

This makes them inapplicable to diverse, in-the-wild datasets of non-alignable scenes rendered from arbitrary camera poses. In this work, we develop a {3D} generator with Generic Priors ({3DGP}): a {3D} synthesis framework with more general assumptions about the training data, and show that it scales to very challenging datasets, like {ImageNet}. Our model is based on three new ideas. First, we incorporate an inaccurate off-the-shelf depth estimator into {3D} {GAN} training via a special depth adaptation module to handle the imprecision. Then, we create a flexible camera model and a regularization strategy for it to learn its distribution parameters during training. Finally, we extend the recent ideas of transferring knowledge from pretrained classifiers into {GANs} for patch-wise trained models by employing a simple distillation-based technique on top of the discriminator. It achieves more stable training than the existing methods and speeds up the convergence by at least 40\%. We explore our model on four datasets: {SDIP} Dogs 256x256, {SDIP} Elephants 256x256, {LSUN} Horses 256x256, and {ImageNet} 256x256 and demonstrate that {3DGP} outperforms the recent state-of-the-art in terms of both texture and geometry quality.},

An {S4} layer combines linear state space models ({SSMs}), the {HiPPO} framework, and deep learning to achieve high performance. We build on the design of the {S4} layer and introduce a new state space layer, the {S5} layer. Whereas an {S4} layer uses many independent single-input, single-output {SSMs}, the {S5} layer uses one multi-input, multi-output {SSM}. We establish a connection between {S5} and {S4}, and use this to develop the initialization and parameterization used by the {S5} model. The result is a state space layer that can leverage efficient and widely implemented parallel scans, allowing {S5} to match the computational efficiency of {S4}, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on several long-range sequence modeling tasks.},

  abstract     = {Large language models distill broad knowledge from text corpora. However, they can be inconsistent when it comes to completing user specified tasks. This issue can be addressed by finetuning such models via supervised learning on curated datasets, or via reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose a novel offline {RL} method, implicit language {Q-learning} ({ILQL}), designed for use on language models, that combines both the flexible utility maximization framework of {RL} algorithms with the ability of supervised learning to leverage previously collected data, as well as its simplicity and stability. Our method employs a combination of value conservatism alongside an implicit dataset support constraint in learning value functions, which are then used to guide language model generations towards maximizing user-specified utility functions.},

As a result, algorithms for these two cases are generally developed and evaluated separately. In this work, we show that a single algorithm---a simple extension to mirror descent with proximal regularization that we call magnetic mirror descent ({MMD})---can produce strong results in both settings, despite their fundamental differences. From a theoretical standpoint, we prove that {MMD} converges linearly to quantal response equilibria (i.e., entropy regularized Nash equilibria) in extensive-form games---this is the first time linear convergence has been proven for a first order solver.},

To this end, we construct a meta algorithm, dubbed as Homotopy-{PO}, which provably finds a Nash equilibrium at a global linear rate. In particular, Homotopy-{PO} interweaves two base algorithms Local-Fast and Global-Slow via homotopy continuation.

To address this dilemma, we introduce Pseudoinverse-guided Diffusion Models ({ΠGDM}), an approach that uses problem-agnostic models to close the gap in performance. {ΠGDM} directly estimates conditional scores from the measurement model of the inverse problem without additional training. It can address inverse problems with noisy, non-linear, or even non-differentiable measurements, in contrast to many existing approaches that are limited to noiseless linear ones. We illustrate the empirical effectiveness of {ΠGDM} on several image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, inpainting and {JPEG} restoration.},

The idea of real-time processing is especially important in audio domain as the human perception of sound is sensitive to any kind of disturbance in perceived signals, especially the lag between auditory and visual modalities. The rise of deep learning ({DL}) models complicated the landscape of signal processing. Although they often have superior quality compared to standard {DSP} methods, this advantage is diminished by higher latency. In this work we propose novel method for minimization of inference time latency and memory consumption, called {Short-Term Memory Convolution} ({STMC}) and its transposed counterpart. The main advantage of {STMC} is the low latency comparable to long short-term memory ({LSTM}) networks. Furthermore, the training of {STMC}-based models is faster and more stable as the method is based solely on convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}). In this study we demonstrate an application of this solution to a {U-Net} model for a speech separation task and {GhostNet} model in acoustic scene classification ({ASC}) task. In case of speech separation we achieved a 5-fold reduction in inference time and a 2-fold reduction in latency without affecting the output quality. The inference time for {ASC} task was up to 4 times faster while preserving the original accuracy.},

Its performance suffers from the non-vanishing biases introduced by the local inconsistent optimal and the rugged client-drifts by the local over-fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel and practical method, {FedSpeed}, to alleviate the negative impacts posed by these problems. Concretely, {FedSpeed} applies the prox-correction term on the current local updates to efficiently reduce the biases introduced by the prox-term, a necessary regularizer to maintain the strong local consistency. Furthermore, {FedSpeed} merges the vanilla stochastic gradient with a perturbation computed from an extra gradient ascent step in the neighborhood, thereby alleviating the issue of local over-fitting. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the convergence rate is related to both the communication rounds T and local intervals K with a tighter upper bound $O(1/T)$ if $K=O(T)$. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments on the real-world dataset to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed {FedSpeed}, which converges significantly faster and achieves the state-of-the-art ({SOTA}) performance on the general {FL} experimental settings than several baselines including {FedAvg}, {FedProx}, {FedCM}, {FedAdam}, {SCAFFOLD}, {FedDyn}, {FedADMM}, etc.},

In this paper, we developed a new framework, named {Alternating Differentiation} ({Alt-Diff}), that differentiates optimization problems (here, specifically in the form of convex optimization problems with polyhedral constraints) in a fast and recursive way. {Alt-Diff} decouples the differentiation procedure into a primal update and a dual update in an alternating way. Accordingly, {Alt-Diff} substantially decreases the dimensions of the Jacobian matrix especially for optimization with large-scale constraints and thus increases the computational speed of implicit differentiation. We present the computational complexity of the forward and backward pass of {Alt-Diff} and show that {Alt-Diff} enjoys quadratic computational complexity in the backward pass. The efficacy and superiority of {Alt-Diff} are demonstrated through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.},

Our approach defines a convolution-like operation and ensures equivariance based on our proposed scalable {Fourier-Argand} representation. The method maintains similar efficiency as a traditional network and hardly introduces any additional learnable parameters, since it does not face the computational issue that often occurs in group-convolution operators. We validate the efficacy of our approach in the image classification task, demonstrating its robustness and the generalization ability to both scaled and rotated inputs.},

However, its success relies on the `local' factor, which ensures that whenever the proposal distribution is restricted to be near the current state, the locally balanced weight functions are asymptotically optimal and the gradient approximations are accurate. In seeking a more efficient sampling algorithm, many recent works have considered increasing the scale of the proposal distributions, but this causes the `local' factor to no longer hold. Instead, we propose any-scale balanced samplers to repair the gap in non-local proposals. In particular, we substitute the locally balanced function with an any-scale balanced function that can self-adjust to achieve better efficiency for proposal distributions at any scale. We also use quadratic approximations to capture curvature of the target distribution and reduce the error in the gradient approximation, while employing a Gaussian integral trick with a special estimated diagonal to efficiently sample from the quadratic proposal distribution. On various synthetic and real distributions, the proposed sampler substantially outperforms existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {The approximate nearest neighbor ({ANN}) search problem is fundamental to efficiently serving many real-world machine learning applications. A number of techniques have been developed for {ANN} search that are efficient, accurate, and scalable. However, such techniques typically have a number of parameters that affect the speed-recall tradeoff, and exhibit poor performance when such parameters aren't properly set. Tuning these parameters has traditionally been a manual process, demanding in-depth knowledge of the underlying search algorithm. This is becoming an increasingly unrealistic demand as {ANN} search grows in popularity. To tackle this obstacle to {ANN} adoption, this work proposes a constrained optimization-based approach to tuning quantization-based {ANN} algorithms. Our technique takes just a desired search cost or recall as input, and then generates tunings that, empirically, are very close to the speed-recall Pareto frontier and give leading performance on standard benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Self-supervised pretraining has been extensively studied in language and vision domains, where a unified model can be easily adapted to various downstream tasks by pretraining representations without explicit labels. When it comes to sequential decision-making tasks, however, it is difficult to properly design such a pretraining approach that can cope with both high-dimensional perceptual information and the complexity of sequential control over long interaction horizons. The challenge becomes combinatorially more complex if we want to pretrain representations amenable to a large variety of tasks. To tackle this problem, in this work, we formulate a general pretraining-finetuning pipeline for sequential decision making, under which we propose a generic pretraining framework Self-supervised Multi-task pretrAining with contRol Transformer ({SMART}). By systematically investigating pretraining regimes, we carefully design a Control Transformer ({CT}) coupled with a novel control-centric pretraining objective in a self-supervised manner. {SMART} encourages the representation to capture the common essential information relevant to short-term control and long-term control, which is transferrable across tasks. We show by extensive experiments in DeepMind Control Suite that {SMART} significantly improves the learning efficiency among seen and unseen downstream tasks and domains under different learning scenarios including Imitation Learning ({IL}) and Reinforcement Learning ({RL}). Benefiting from the proposed control-centric objective, {SMART} is resilient to distribution shift between pretraining and finetuning, and even works well with low-quality pretraining datasets that are randomly collected.},

However, the gradient of the log-likelihood function, \ie, the score function, is not properly defined for discrete spaces. This makes it non-trivial to adapt {SDE} with score functions to categorical data. In this paper, we extend diffusion models to discrete variables by introducing a stochastic jump process where the reverse process denoises via a continuous-time Markov chain. This formulation admits an analytical simulation during backward sampling. To learn the reverse process, we extend score matching to general categorical data, and show that an unbiased estimator can be obtained via simple matching of the conditional marginal distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a set of synthetic and real-world music and image benchmarks.},

To reduce the annotation cost, we propose using Active Learning ({AL}) for sampling the most informative data. However, directly porting current {AL} methods to the {SGG} task poses the following challenges: 1) unreliable uncertainty estimates, and 2) data bias problems. To deal with these challenges, we propose {EDAL} (Evidential Uncertainty and Diversity Guided Deep Active Learning), a novel {AL} framework tailored for the {SGG} task. For challenge 1), we start with Evidential Deep Learning ({EDL}) coupled with a global relationship mining approach to estimate uncertainty, which can effectively overcome the perturbations of open-set relationships and background-relationships to obtain reliable uncertainty estimates. To address challenge 2), we seek the diversity-based method and design the Context Blocking Module ({CBM}) and Image Blocking Module ({IBM}) to alleviate context-level bias and image-level bias, respectively. Experiments show that our {AL} framework can approach the performance of a fully supervised {SGG} model with only about 10\% annotation cost.},

  abstract     = {Communication is important in many multi-agent reinforcement learning ({MARL}) problems for agents to share information and make good decisions. However, when deploying trained communicative agents in a real-world application where noise and potential attackers exist, the safety of communication-based policies becomes a severe issue that is underexplored. Specifically, if communication messages are manipulated by malicious attackers, agents relying on untrustworthy communication may take unsafe actions that lead to catastrophic consequences. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that agents will not be misled by corrupted communication, while still benefiting from benign communication. In this work, we consider an environment with $N$ agents, where the attacker may arbitrarily change the communication from any $C<\frac{N-1}{2}$ agents to a victim agent. For this strong threat model, we propose a certifiable defense by constructing a message-ensemble policy that aggregates multiple randomly ablated message sets. Theoretical analysis shows that this message-ensemble policy can utilize benign communication while being certifiably robust to adversarial communication, regardless of the attacking algorithm. Experiments in multiple environments verify that our defense significantly improves the robustness of trained policies against various types of attacks.},

This setting, also known as causal Bayesian optimization ({CBO}), has important applications in medicine, ecology, and manufacturing. Standard Bayesian optimization algorithms fail to effectively leverage the underlying causal structure. Existing {CBO} approaches assume noiseless measurements and do not come with guarantees. We propose the model-based causal Bayesian optimization algorithm ({MCBO}) that learns a full system model instead of only modeling intervention-reward pairs. {MCBO} propagates epistemic uncertainty about the causal mechanisms through the graph and trades off exploration and exploitation via the optimism principle. We bound its cumulative regret, and obtain the first non-asymptotic bounds for {CBO}. Unlike in standard Bayesian optimization, our acquisition function cannot be evaluated in closed form, so we show how the reparameterization trick can be used to apply gradient-based optimizers. The resulting practical implementation of {MCBO} compares favorably with state-of-the-art approaches empirically.},

These subset sizes are rarely explicitly learned - be it the cluster sizes in clustering applications or the number of shared versus independent generative latent factors in weakly-supervised learning. Probability distributions over correct combinations of subset sizes are non-differentiable due to hard constraints, which prohibit gradient-based optimization. In this work, we propose the differentiable hypergeometric distribution. The hypergeometric distribution models the probability of different group sizes based on their relative importance. We introduce reparameterizable gradients to learn the importance between groups and highlight the advantage of explicitly learning the size of subsets in two typical applications: weakly-supervised learning and clustering. In both applications, we outperform previous approaches, which rely on suboptimal heuristics to model the unknown size of groups.},

In this work, we establish a quantitative weak propagation of chaos result for the system, with a finite-particle discretization error of $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$ \textit{uniformly over time}, where $N$ is the width of the neural network. This allows us to directly transfer the optimization guarantee for infinite-width networks to practical finite-width models without excessive overparameterization. On the technical side, our analysis differs from most existing studies on similar mean field dynamics in that we do not require the interaction between particles to be sufficiently weak to obtain a uniform propagation of chaos, because such assumptions may not be satisfied in neural network optimization. Instead, we make use of a logarithmic Sobolev-type condition which can be verified in appropriate regularized risk minimization settings.},

We propose an algorithm that allows the user to tune this hyperparameter at runtime, thereby addressing both of the above mentioned issues simultaneously. This allows users to start with the original behavior and grant successively greater deviation, as well as stopping at any time when the policy deteriorates or the behavior is too far from the familiar one.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we leverage low-level compiler intermediate representations ({IR}) code translation. Traditional transpilers rely on syntactic information and handcrafted rules, which limits their applicability and produces unnatural-looking code. Applying neural machine translation ({NMT}) approaches to code has successfully broadened the set of programs on which one can get a natural-looking translation. However, they treat the code as sequences of text tokens, and still do not differentiate well enough between similar pieces of code which have different semantics in different languages. The consequence is low quality translation, reducing the practicality of {NMT}, and stressing the need for an approach significantly increasing its accuracy. Here we propose to augment code translation with {IRs}, specifically {LLVM} {IR}, with results on the {C++}, Java, Rust, and Go languages. Our method improves upon the state of the art for unsupervised code translation, increasing the number of correct translations by 11\% on average, and up to 79\% for the Java $\rightarrow$ Rust pair with greedy decoding. With beam search, it increases the number of correct translations by 5.5\% in average. We extend previous test sets for code translation, by adding hundreds of Go and Rust functions. Additionally, we train models with high performance on the problem of {IR} decompilation, generating programming source code from {IR}, and study using {IRs} as intermediary pivot for translation.},

We introduce {BC-IRL} a new inverse reinforcement learning method that learns reward functions that generalize better when compared to maximum-entropy {IRL} approaches. In contrast to the {MaxEnt} framework, which learns to maximize rewards around demonstrations, {BC-IRL} updates reward parameters such that the policy trained with the new reward matches the expert demonstrations better. We show that {BC-IRL} learns rewards that generalize better on an illustrative simple task and two continuous robotic control tasks, achieving over twice the success rate of baselines in challenging generalization settings.},

While prior works on {NeRFs} optimize a scene representation by inverting a handcrafted rendering equation, {GNT} achieves neural representation and rendering that generalizes across scenes using transformers at two stages. (1) The view transformer leverages multi-view geometry as an inductive bias for attention-based scene representation, and predicts coordinate-aligned features by aggregating information from epipolar lines on the neighboring views. (2) The ray transformer renders novel views using attention to decode the features from the view transformer along the sampled points during ray marching. Our experiments demonstrate that when optimized on a single scene, {GNT} can successfully reconstruct {NeRF} without an explicit rendering formula due to the learned ray renderer. When trained on multiple scenes, {GNT} consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance when transferring to unseen scenes and outperform all other methods by $\sim$10\% on average. Our analysis of the learned attention maps to infer depth and occlusion indicate that attention enables learning a physically-grounded rendering. Our results show the promise of transformers as a universal modeling tool for graphics.},

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning ({RL}) has achieved remarkable successes in complex single-task settings. However, designing {RL} agents that can learn multiple tasks and leverage prior experience to quickly adapt to a related new task remains challenging. Despite previous attempts to improve on these areas, our understanding of multi-task training and generalization in {RL} remains limited. To fill this gap, we investigate the generalization capabilities of a popular actor-critic method, {IMPALA}. Specifically, we build on previous work that has advocated for the use of modes and difficulties of Atari 2600 games as a challenging benchmark for transfer learning in {RL}. We do so by pretraining an agent on multiple variants of the same Atari game before fine-tuning on the remaining never-before-seen variants. This protocol simplifies the multi-task pretraining phase by limiting negative interference between tasks and allows us to better understand the dynamics of multi-task training and generalization. We find that, given a fixed amount of pretraining data, agents trained with more variations are able to generalize better. Surprisingly, we also observe that this advantage can still be present after fine-tuning for 200M environment frames than when doing zero-shot transfer. This highlights the potential effect of a good learned representation. We also find that, even though small networks have remained popular to solve Atari 2600 games, increasing the capacity of the value and policy network is critical to achieve good performance as we increase the number of pretraining modes and difficulties. Overall, our findings emphasize key points that are essential for efficient multi-task training and generalization in reinforcement learning.},

We evaluate humans and models on {AmbiBench} by seeing how well they identify the intended task using 1) instructions with varying degrees of ambiguity, and 2) different numbers of labeled examples. We find that the combination of model scaling (to 175B parameters) and reinforcement learning from human feedback ({RLHF}) enables models to approach or exceed the accuracy of human participants across tasks, but that either one of these alone is not sufficient. In addition, we show how to dramatically improve the accuracy of language models trained without {RLHF} by finetuning on a small number of ambiguous in-context examples, providing a promising direction for teaching models to generalize well in the face of ambiguity.},

Therefore, compressing {DRL} models possesses immense potential for training acceleration and model deployment. However, existing methods that generate small models mainly adopt the knowledge distillation-based approach by iteratively training a dense network. As a result, the training process still demands massive computing resources. Indeed, sparse training from scratch in {DRL} has not been well explored and is particularly challenging due to non-stationarity in bootstrap training. In this work, we propose a novel sparse {DRL} training framework, 'the {Rigged Reinforcement Learning Lottery}' ({RLx2}), which builds upon gradient-based topology evolution and is capable of training a sparse {DRL} model based entirely on a sparse network. Specifically, {RLx2} introduces a novel multi-step {TD} target mechanism with a dynamic-capacity replay buffer to achieve robust value learning and efficient topology exploration in sparse models. It also reaches state-of-the-art sparse training performance in several tasks, showing 7.5×--20× model compression with less than 3\% performance degradation and up to 20× and 50× {FLOPs} reduction for training and inference, respectively.},

Reported performance has trailed behind standard supervised pre-training by a large margin, barring self-supervised learning from making an impact on models that are deployed on device. Most prior works attribute this poor performance to the capacity bottleneck of the low-compute networks and opt to bypass the problem through the use of knowledge distillation ({KD}). In this work, we revisit {SSL} for efficient neural networks, taking a closer look at what are the detrimental factors causing the practical limitations, and whether they are intrinsic to the self-supervised low-compute setting. We find that, contrary to accepted knowledge, there is no intrinsic architectural bottleneck. We diagnose that the performance bottleneck is related to the model complexity vs regularization strength trade-off. We hypothesize that the view sampling strategy for large neural networks, which requires matching views in very diverse spatial scales and contexts, is too demanding for low-capacity architectures. We systematize the design of the view sampling mechanism, leading to a new training methodology that consistently improves performance across different {SSL} methods, different low-size networks, and different tasks. Our best models establish new state-of-the-art for {SSL} methods on low-compute networks despite not using a {KD} loss term.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning models can be biased towards certain demographic groups. This work studies the pursuit of long-term fairness through the interplay between decision-making and the underlying data generating process. We formulate and investigate a long-term fairness notion that captures the decision-distribution interplay via detailed modeling over both observed and latent causal factors. Through causal modeling with a directed acyclic graph ({DAG}), we investigate the possibility of achieving long-term fairness from the dynamics perspective. Different from previous fairness notions defined purely on observed variables, our notion goes one step further, capturing behind-the-scenes situation changes on the unobserved latent causal factors that directly carry out the influence from the current decision to the future data distribution. We propose Tier Balancing, a technically more challenging but more natural notion to achieve in the context of long-term, dynamic fairness analysis. Under the specified dynamics, we prove that in general one cannot achieve the long-term fairness goal only through one-step interventions, and present possibility and impossibility results for approaching long-term fairness goals.},

  abstract     = {Out-of-distribution ({OOD}) detection is indispensable for safely deploying machine learning models in the wild. One of the key challenges is that models lack supervision signals from unknown data, and as a result, can produce overconfident predictions on {OOD} data. Recent work on outlier synthesis modeled the feature space as parametric {G}aussian distribution, a strong and restrictive assumption that might not hold in reality. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, non-parametric outlier synthesis ({NPOS}), which generates artificial {OOD} training data and facilitates learning a reliable decision boundary between {ID} and {OOD} data. Importantly, our proposed synthesis approach does not make any distributional assumption on the {ID} embeddings, thereby offering strong flexibility and generality. We show that our synthesis approach can be mathematically interpreted as a rejection sampling framework. Extensive experiments show that {NPOS} can achieve superior {OOD} detection performance, outperforming the competitive rivals by a significant margin.

  abstract     = {Large pre-trained language models have helped to achieve state of the art on a variety of {NLP} tasks, nevertheless, they still suffer from forgetting when incrementally learning a series of sequential tasks. To alleviate this problem, recent works propose several models enhanced by sparse experience replay and local adaption, which yield satisfactory performance. However, in this paper we find that pre-trained language models like {BERT} have a potential ability to learn sequentially, even without any sparse memory replay. To verify the ability of {BERT} to maintain old knowledge, we adopt and re-finetune single-layer probe networks with the parameters of {BERT} fixed. We investigate the models on two typical kinds of {NLP} tasks, text classifications and extractive question answering. And our experiments reveal that {BERT} can actually generate high quality representations for previous tasks in a long term, under extremely sparse replay or even no replay. We further introduce a series of methods to interpret the mechanism of forgetting and how memory rehearsal plays a significant role in task incremental learning, which bridges the gap between our new discovery and previous studies about catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, we provide both quantified and visualized results demonstrating that the representation space of {BERT} is always topologically organised, which guarantees its performance.},

  abstract     = {Designing an accurate and explainable reward function for many {R}einforcement {L}earning tasks is a cumbersome and tedious process. Instead, learning policies directly from the feedback of human teachers naturally integrates human domain knowledge into the policy optimization process. However, different feedback modalities, such as demonstrations and preferences, provide distinct benefits and disadvantages. For example, demonstrations convey a lot of information about the task but are often hard or costly to obtain from real experts while preferences typically contain less information but are in most cases cheap to generate. Existing methods centered around human feedback mostly focus on a single teaching modality, causing them to miss out on important training data while making them less intuitive to use. In this paper we propose a novel method for policy learning that incorporates two different feedback types, namely demonstrations and preferences. To this end, we make use of the connection between discriminator training and density ratio estimation to incorporate preferences into the popular {A}dversarial {I}mitation {L}earning paradigm. This insight allows us to express loss functions over both demonstrations and preferences in a unified framework. Besides expert demonstrations, we are also able to learn from imperfect ones and combine them with preferences to achieve improved task performance. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of combining both preferences and demonstrations on common benchmarks and also show that our method can efficiently learn challenging robot manipulation tasks.},

To date, there seems to be still no consensus on what the right architecture and pre-training setup should be. This paper presents a unified framework for pre-training models that are universally effective across datasets and setups. We begin by disentangling architectural archetypes with pre-training objectives -- two concepts that are commonly conflated. Next, we present a generalized and unified perspective for self-supervision in {NLP} and show how different pre-training objectives can be cast as one another and how interpolating between different objectives can be effective. We then propose {M}ixture-of-{D}enoisers ({MoD}), a pre-training objective that combines diverse pre-training paradigms together. We furthermore introduce a notion of mode switching, wherein downstream fine-tuning is associated with specific pre-training schemes. We conduct extensive ablative experiments to compare multiple pre-training objectives and find that our method pushes the {P}areto-frontier by outperforming {T5} and/or {GPT}-like models across multiple diverse setups. Finally, by scaling our model up to 20{B} parameters, we achieve {SOTA} performance on 50 well-established supervised {NLP} tasks ranging from language generation (with automated and human evaluation), language understanding, text classification, question answering, commonsense reasoning, long text reasoning, structured knowledge grounding and information retrieval. Our model also achieve strong results at in-context learning, outperforming 175{B} {GPT}-3 on zero-shot {S}uper{GLUE} and tripling the performance of {T5}-{XXL} on one-shot summarization. Finally, we show that {UL2} 20{B} works well with chain-of-thought prompting and reasoning, making it an appealing choice for research into reasoning at a small to medium scale of 20{B} parameters. We release {F}lax-based {T5X} model checkpoints for the 20{B} model publicly.},

The first regime is near initialization, specifically until the weights have moved by $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt m)$, where $m$ denotes the network width, which is in sharp contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ weight motion allowed by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK); here it is shown that GF and SGD only need a network width and number of samples inversely proportional to the NTK margin, and moreover that GF attains at least the NTK margin itself and in particular escapes bad KKT points of the margin objective, whereas prior work could only establish nondecreasing but arbitrarily small margins. The second regime is the Neural Collapse (NC) setting, where data lies in well-separated groups, and the sample complexity scales with the number of groups; here the contribution over prior work is an analysis of the entire GF trajectory from initialization. Lastly, if the inner layer weights are constrained to change in norm only and can not rotate, then GF with large widths achieves globally maximal margins, and its sample complexity scales with their inverse; this is in contrast to prior work, which required infinite width and a tricky dual convergence assumption.},

From a theoretical perspective, we demonstrate that feature conformal prediction provably outperforms regular conformal prediction under mild assumptions. Our approach could be combined with not only vanilla conformal prediction, but also other adaptive conformal prediction methods. Apart from experiments on existing predictive inference benchmarks, we also demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed methods on \textit{large-scale} tasks such as ImageNet classification and Cityscapes image segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Natural and expressive human motion generation is the holy grail of computer animation. It is a challenging task, due to the diversity of possible motion, human perceptual sensitivity to it, and the difficulty of accurately describing it. Therefore, current generative solutions are either low-quality or limited in expressiveness. Diffusion models are promising candidates for the human motion domain since they have already shown remarkable generative capabilities in other domains, and their many-to-many nature. In this paper, we introduce Motion Diffusion Model (MDM), a carefully adapted classifier-free diffusion-based generative model for human motion data. MDM is transformer-based, combining insights from motion generation literature. A notable design-choice is that it predicts the sample itself rather than the noise in each step to facilitate the use of established geometric losses on the locations and velocities of the motion, such as the foot contact loss. As we demonstrate, MDM is a generic approach, enabling different modes of conditioning, and different generation tasks. We show that our model is trained with lightweight resources and yet achieves state-of-the-art results on leading benchmarks for text-to-motion, action-to-motion, and unconditioned motion generation.},

However, standard message passing does not explicitly account for long-range and directional interactions, for instance due to electrostatics. In this work, an anisotropic state based on Cartesian multipoles is proposed as an addition to the existing hidden features. With the anisotropic state, message passing can be modified to explicitly account for directional interactions. Compared to existing models, this modification results in relatively little additional computational cost. Most importantly, the proposed formalism offers as a distinct advantage the seamless integration of (1) anisotropic long-range interactions, (2) interactions with surrounding fields and particles that are not part of the graph, and (3) the fast multipole method. As an exemplary use case, the application to quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) systems is demonstrated.},

In this paper, we study the role of nonlinearity in the training dynamics of contrastive learning (CL) on one and two-layer nonlinear networks with homogeneous activation $h(x) = h'(x)x$. We have two major theoretical discoveries. First, the presence of nonlinearity can lead to many local optima even in 1-layer setting, each corresponding to certain patterns from the data distribution, while with linear activation, only one major pattern can be learned. This suggests that models with lots of parameters can be regarded as a \emph{brute-force} way to find these local optima induced by nonlinearity. Second, in the 2-layer case, linear activation is proven not capable of learning specialized weights into diverse patterns, demonstrating the importance of nonlinearity. In addition, for 2-layer setting, we also discover \emph{global modulation}: those local patterns discriminative from the perspective of global-level patterns are prioritized to learn, further characterizing the learning process. Simulation verifies our theoretical findings.},

Large deep networks have become increasingly effective at modeling complex video data in a self-supervised manner, as evaluated by metrics based on human perceptual similarity or pixel-wise comparison. However, it remains unclear whether current metrics are accurate indicators of performance on downstream tasks. We find empirically that for planning robotic manipulation, existing metrics can be unreliable at predicting execution success. To address this, we propose a benchmark for action-conditioned video prediction in the form of a control benchmark that evaluates a given model for simulated robotic manipulation through sampling-based planning. Our benchmark, Video Prediction for Visual Planning (VP²), includes simulated environments with 11 task categories and 310 task instance definitions, a full planning implementation, and training datasets containing scripted interaction trajectories for each task category. A central design goal of our benchmark is to expose a simple interface -- a single forward prediction call -- so it is straightforward to evaluate almost any action-conditioned video prediction model. We then leverage our benchmark to study the effects of scaling model size, quantity of training data, and model ensembling by analyzing five highly-performant video prediction models, finding that while scale can improve perceptual quality when modelling visually diverse settings, other attributes such as uncertainty awareness can also aid planning performance.},

In particular, we perform a series of sensitivity and ablation analyses on several benchmark domains where rewards learned from preferences achieve minimal test error but fail to generalize to out-of-distribution states---resulting in poor policy performance when optimized. We find that the presence of non-causal distractor features, noise in the stated preferences, and partial state observability can all exacerbate reward misidentification.},

Both adversarial training (AT) and base classifiers for Random Smoothing (RS) induced remarkably straightened feature codes.

Current RL agents can solve families of related tasks at best, or require planning anew for each task. Strategies for approximate zero-shot RL have been suggested using successor features (SFs) or forward-backward (FB) representations, but testing has been limited. After clarifying the relationships between these schemes, we introduce improved losses and new SF models, and test the viability of zero-shot RL schemes systematically on tasks from the Unsupervised RL benchmark.},

  abstract     = {A locality-sensitive hash (LSH) is a function that can efficiently map dataset points into a latent space while preserving pairwise distances. Such LSH functions have been used in approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) through classic hash clustering (CHC): dataset points are hashed into a low-dimensional binary space, then clustered by hash values. However, CHC mandates a low-dimensional latent space for the LSH function, which distorts distances from the original high-dimensional space, resulting in inferior recall. We introduce the Polar Code Nearest-Neighbor (PCNN) algorithm, which uses modern error-correcting codes (specifically polar codes) to maintain a manageable number of clusters inside a high-dimensional latent space. PCNN uses efficient list-decoding methods for polar codes with time complexity independent of dataset size, allowing the LSH function to embed into high-dimensional latent space for higher recall.},

Visual room rearrangement evaluates an agent's ability to rearrange objects in a room to a desired goal based solely on visual input. We propose a simple yet effective method for this problem: (1) search for and map which objects need to be rearranged, and (2) rearrange each object until the task is complete. Our approach consists of an off-the-shelf semantic segmentation model, voxel-based semantic map, and semantic search policy to efficiently find objects that need to be rearranged. Our method was the winning submission to the AI2-THOR Rearrangement Challenge in the 2022 Embodied AI Workshop at CVPR 2022, and improves on current state-of-the-art end-to-end reinforcement learning-based methods that learn visual room rearrangement policies from 0.53% correct rearrangement to 16.56%, using only 2.7% as many samples from the environment.},

Starting from a recently proposed Fourier representation of flow fields, the {F-FNO} bridges the performance gap between pure machine learning approaches to that of the best numerical or hybrid solvers. This is achieved with new representations -- separable spectral layers and improved residual connections -- and a combination of training strategies such as the Markov assumption, Gaussian noise, and cosine learning rate decay. On several challenging benchmark {PDEs} on regular grids, structured meshes, and point clouds, the {F-FNO} can scale to deeper networks and outperform both the {FNO} and the geo-{FNO}, reducing the error by 83\% on the Navier-Stokes problem, 31\% on the elasticity problem, 57\% on the airfoil flow problem, and 60\% on the plastic forging problem. Compared to the state-of-the-art pseudo-spectral method, the {F-FNO} can take a step size that is an order of magnitude larger in time and achieve an order of magnitude speedup to produce the same solution quality.},

  abstract     = {Despite the success of neural network models in a range of domains, it remains an open question whether they can learn to represent abstract logical operators such as negation and disjunction. We test the hypothesis that neural networks without inherent inductive biases for logical reasoning can acquire an implicit representation of negation and disjunction. Here, implicit refers to limited, domain-specific forms of these operators, and work in psychology suggests these operators may be a precursor (developmentally and evolutionarily) to the type of abstract, domain-general logic that is characteristic of adult humans. To test neural networks, we adapt a test designed to diagnose the presence of negation and disjunction in animals and pre-verbal children, which requires inferring the location of a hidden object using constraints of the physical environment as well as implicit logic: if a ball is hidden in {A} or {B}, and shown not to be in {A}, can the subject infer that it is in {B}? Our results show that, despite the neural networks learning to track objects behind occlusion, they are unable to generalize to a task that requires implicit logic. We further show that models are unable to generalize to the test task even when they are trained directly on a logically identical (though visually dissimilar) task. However, experiments using transfer learning reveal that the models do recognize structural similarity between tasks which invoke the same logical reasoning pattern, suggesting that some desirable abstractions are learned, even if they are not yet sufficient to pass established tests of logical reasoning.},

We propose to learn a distribution over diverse and longer protein backbone structures via an {E(3)}-equivariant graph neural network. We develop {SMCDiff} to efficiently sample scaffolds from this distribution conditioned on a given motif; our algorithm is the first to theoretically guarantee conditional samples from a diffusion model in the large-compute limit.

By combining the strong power of deep learning models with the interpretability of case-based inference, ProtoPNet can achieve high accuracy while keeping its reasoning process interpretable. Many methods based on ProtoPNet have emerged to take advantage of this benefit, but despite their practical usefulness, they run into difficulty when utilizing similarity-based classifiers, e.g., in domains where unknown class samples exist. This is because ProtoPNet and its variants adopt the training process specific to linear classifiers, which allows the prototypes to represent useful image features for class recognition. Due to this difficulty, the effectiveness of similarity-based classifiers (e.g., k-nearest neighbor ({KNN})) on the 'this looks like that' framework have not been sufficiently examined. To alleviate this problem, we propose {ProtoKNN}, an extension of ProtoPNet that adopts {KNN} classifiers. Extensive experiments on multiple open datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve competitive results with a state-of-the-art method.},

However, in cases of high rates of missing features, they were unable to avoid significant performance degradation. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel concept of channel-wise confidence in a node feature, which is assigned to each imputed channel feature of a node for reflecting the certainty of the imputation. We then design pseudo-confidence using the channel-wise shortest path distance between a missing-feature node and its nearest known-feature node to replace unavailable true confidence in an actual learning process. Based on the pseudo-confidence, we propose a novel feature imputation scheme that performs channel-wise inter-node diffusion and node-wise inter-channel propagation. The scheme can endure even at an exceedingly high missing rate (e.g., 99.5\%) and it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for both semi-supervised node classification and link prediction on various datasets containing a high rate of missing features.},

A new flexible framework that allows users to pick certain regions of the background image and use it to guide the harmonization is proposed. Inspired by professional portrait harmonization users, we also introduce a new luminance matching loss to optimally match the color/luminance conditions between the composite foreground and select reference region. This framework provides more control to the image harmonization pipeline achieving visually pleasing portrait edits. Furthermore, we also introduce a new dataset carefully curated for validating portrait harmonization. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed approach is efficient and robust compared to previous harmonization baselines, especially for portraits.},

Samples from the generative model are then obtained by simulating an approximation of the time-reversal of this diffusion initialized by {Gaussian} samples. Practically, the intractable score terms appearing in the time-reversed process are approximated using score matching techniques. We explore here a similar idea to sample approximately from unnormalized probability density functions and estimate their normalizing constants. We consider a process where the target density diffuses towards a {Gaussian}. Denoising Diffusion Samplers ({DDS}) are obtained by approximating the corresponding time-reversal. While score matching is not applicable in this context, we can leverage many of the ideas introduced in generative modeling for {Monte Carlo} sampling. Existing theoretical results from denoising diffusion models also provide theoretical guarantees for {DDS}. We discuss the connections between {DDS}, optimal control and {Schrödinger} bridges and finally demonstrate {DDS} experimentally on a variety of challenging sampling tasks.},

Our key idea is to consider the dynamics of the second moments of model parameters for a special family of "Spectrally Expressible" approximations. This allows to obtain an explicit expression for the generating function of the sequence of loss values. By analyzing this generating function, we find, in particular, that 1) the {SGD} dynamics exhibits several convergent and divergent regimes depending on the spectral distributions of the problem; 2) the convergent regimes admit explicit stability conditions, and explicit loss asymptotics in the case of power-law spectral distributions; 3) the optimal convergence rate can be achieved at negative momenta. We verify our theoretical predictions by extensive experiments with {MNIST} and synthetic problems, and find a good quantitative agreement.},

Our model utilizes a discrete diffusion process that progressively edits graphs with noise, through the process of adding or removing edges and changing the categories. A graph transformer network is trained to revert this process, simplifying the problem of distribution learning over graphs into a sequence of node and edge classification tasks. We further improve sample quality by introducing a {Markovian} noise model that preserves the marginal distribution of node and edge types during diffusion, and by incorporating auxiliary graph-theoretic features. A procedure for conditioning the generation on graph-level features is also proposed. {DiGress} achieves state-of-the-art performance on molecular and non-molecular datasets, with up to 3x validity improvement on a planar graph dataset. It is also the first model to scale to the large {GuacaMol} dataset containing 1.3M drug-like molecules without the use of molecule-specific representations.},

To address these issues, we introduce a new model for learning video representation which compresses the video to a small representation of discrete tokens. This tokenizer uses causal attention in time, which allows it to work with variable-length videos. To generate video tokens from text we are using a bidirectional masked transformer conditioned on pre-computed text tokens. The generated video tokens are subsequently de-tokenized to create the actual video. The paper also demonstrates how joint training on a large corpus of image-text pairs as well as a smaller number of video-text examples can result in generalization beyond what is available in the video datasets.},

  abstract     = {Interpretable machine learning offers insights into what factors drive a certain prediction of a black-box system. A large number of interpreting methods focus on identifying explanatory input features, which generally fall into two main categories: attribution and selection. A popular attribution-based approach is to exploit local neighborhoods for learning instance-specific explainers in an additive manner. The process is thus inefficient and susceptible to poorly-conditioned samples. Meanwhile, many selection-based methods directly optimize local feature distributions in an instance-wise training framework, thereby being capable of leveraging global information from other inputs. However, they can only interpret single-class predictions and many suffer from inconsistency across different settings, due to a strict reliance on a pre-defined number of features selected. This work exploits the strengths of both methods and proposes a framework for learning local explanations simultaneously for multiple target classes. Our model explainer significantly outperforms additive and instance-wise counterparts on faithfulness with more compact and comprehensible explanations. We also demonstrate the capacity to select stable and important features through extensive experiments on various data sets and black-box model architectures.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian meta-learning ({BML}) enables fitting expressive generative models to small datasets by incorporating inductive priors learned from a set of related tasks. The Neural Process ({NP}) is a prominent deep neural network-based {BML} architecture, which has shown remarkable results in recent years. In its standard formulation, the {NP} encodes epistemic uncertainty in an amortized, factorized, {G}aussian variational ({VI}) approximation to the {BML} task posterior ({TP}), using reparametrized gradients. Prior work studies a range of architectural modifications to boost performance, such as attentive computation paths or improved context aggregation schemes, while the influence of the {VI} scheme remains under-explored. We aim to bridge this gap by introducing {GMM}-{NP}, a novel {BML} model, which builds on recent work that enables highly accurate, full-covariance {G}aussian mixture ({GMM}) {TP} approximations by combining {VI} with natural gradients and trust regions. We show that {GMM}-{NP} yields tighter evidence lower bounds, which increases the efficiency of marginal likelihood optimization, leading to improved epistemic uncertainty estimation and accuracy. {GMM}-{NP} does not require complex architectural modifications, resulting in a powerful, yet conceptually simple {BML} model, which outperforms the state of the art on a range of challenging experiments, highlighting its applicability to settings where data is scarce.},

We present a simple example where randomized smoothing certifies a radius of $1.26$ around a point, even though there is an adversarial example in the distance $0.8$ and show how this can be abused to give false certificates for {CIFAR}10. We discuss the implicit assumptions of randomized smoothing and show that they do not apply to generic image classification models whose smoothed versions are commonly certified. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a sound approach to randomized smoothing when using floating-point precision with essentially equal speed for quantized input. It yields sound certificates or image classifiers which for the ones tested so far are very similar to the unsound practice of randomized smoothing. Our only assumption is that we have access to a fair coin.},

  abstract     = {Learned classifiers should often possess certain invariance properties meant to encourage fairness, robustness, or out-of-distribution generalization. However, multiple recent works empirically demonstrate that common invariance-inducing regularizers are ineffective in the over-parameterized regime, in which classifiers perfectly fit (i.e. interpolate) the training data. This suggests that the phenomenon of ``benign overfitting,'' in which models generalize well despite interpolating, might not favorably extend to settings in which robustness or fairness are desirable. In this work, we provide a theoretical justification for these observations. We prove that---even in the simplest of settings---any interpolating learning rule (with an arbitrarily small margin) will not satisfy these invariance properties. We then propose and analyze an algorithm that---in the same setting---successfully learns a non-interpolating classifier that is provably invariant. We validate our theoretical observations on simulated data and the Waterbirds dataset.},

This enables the discovery of reoccurring visual and geometric patterns across scenes which are transferable to downstream tasks. We show that {NRC} representations transfer well to object navigation in {THOR}, outperforming 2D and 3D representation learning methods by 3.1\% success rate. We demonstrate that our approach is able to perform unsupervised segmentation for more complex synthetic ({THOR}) and real scenes ({NYU} Depth) better than prior methods (29\% relative improvement).

However, in these settings it is reasonable to attempt to recover the best policy possible given the agent's restricted access to information. We provide a set of necessary criteria on the expert that will allow a learner to recover the optimal policy in the reduced information space from the expert's advice alone. We also provide a new approach called {E}lf {D}istillation ({E}xplorer {L}earning from {F}ollower) that can be used in cases where these criteria are not met and environmental rewards must be taken into account.

However, the computational cost and memory requirement renders these methods unsuitable on the mobile device. In this paper, we introduce a new method squeeze-enhanced Axial Transformer ({SeaFormer}) for mobile visual recognition. Specifically, we design a generic attention block characterized by the formulation of squeeze Axial and detail enhancement. It can be further used to create a family of backbone architectures with superior cost-effectiveness. Coupled with a light segmentation head, we achieve the best trade-off between segmentation accuracy and latency on the {ARM}-based mobile devices on the {ADE}20K, Cityscapes, Pascal Context and {COCO}-Stuff datasets. Critically, we beat both the mobilefriendly rivals and Transformer-based counterparts with better performance and lower latency without bells and whistles. Furthermore, we incorporate a feature upsampling-based multi-resolution distillation technique, further reducing the inference latency of the proposed framework. Beyond semantic segmentation, we further apply the proposed {SeaFormer} architecture to image classification and object detection problems, demonstrating the potential of serving as a versatile mobile-friendly backbone.},

One generalizable and scalable strategy for {HOI} detection is to use weak supervision, learning from image-level annotations only. This is inherently challenging due to ambiguous human-object associations, large search space of detecting {HOI}s and highly noisy training signal. A promising strategy to address those challenges is to exploit knowledge from large-scale pretrained models (e.g., {CLIP}), but a direct knowledge distillation strategy does not perform well on the weakly-supervised setting. In contrast, we develop a {CLIP}-guided {HOI} representation capable of incorporating the prior knowledge at both image level and {HOI} instance level, and adopt a self-taught mechanism to prune incorrect human-object associations. Experimental results on {HICO}-{DET} and {V}-{COCO} show that our method outperforms the previous works by a sizable margin, showing the efficacy of our {HOI} representation.},

In this work, we construct hypernetwork-based latent dynamical models directly on the parameter space of a compact representation network.

These properties render our surrogate models highly efficient at inference time. We show the efficacy of our framework by learning models that generate accurate multi-step rollout predictions at much faster inference speed compared to competitors, for several challenging examples.},

To address this, we propose a novel pre-training framework, named {VaLM}, to Visually-augment text tokens with retrieved relevant images for Language Modeling. Specifically, {VaLM} builds on a novel latent text-image alignment method via an image retrieval module to fetch corresponding images given a textual context. With the visually-augmented context, {VaLM} uses a visual knowledge fusion layer to enable multimodal grounded language modeling by attending to both text context and visual knowledge in images. We evaluate {VaLM} on various visual knowledge-intensive commonsense reasoning tasks, which require visual information to excel. The experimental results illustrate that {VaLM} outperforms all strong language-only and vision-language baselines with substantial gains in reasoning object commonsense including color, size, and shape.},

Specifically, we propose to penalize the gram matrix of convolutional filters to decorrelate the pruned filters from the retained filters.

We further introduce a self-adaptive class fairness regularization penalty to encourage the model for diverse predictions during the early training stage. Extensive experiments indicate the superiority of FreeMatch especially when the labeled data are extremely rare.

And they do not allow for targeted modeling of local features as CNN structures do. To solve the above problems, we propose to combine local features and global correlations to capture the overall view of time series (e.g., fluctuations, trends). To fully exploit the underlying information in the time series, a multi-scale branch structure is adopted to model different potential patterns separately. Each pattern is extracted with down-sampled convolution and isometric convolution for local features and global correlations, respectively. In addition to being more effective, our proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, MICN yields 17.2\% and 21.6\% relative improvements for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively.},

While recent dynamic-structure-based CIL methods achieve remarkable performance, these methods train all modules in a coupled manner and do not consider possible conflicts among modules, resulting in spoilage of eventual predictions. We propose a unifying energy-based theory and framework called Bi-Compatible Energy-Based Expansion and Fusion (BEEF) to analyze and achieve the goal of CIL. BEEF demonstrates the possibility of training independent modules in a decoupled manner while achieving bi-directional compatibility among modules through two additionally allocated prototypes, and then integrating them into a unifying classifier with minimal cost. Furthermore, BEEF extends the exemplar-set to a more challenging setting, where exemplars are randomly selected and imbalanced, and maintains its performance when prior methods fail dramatically. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks: CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1000 demonstrate that BEEF achieves state-of-the-art performance in both the ordinary and challenging CIL settings.},

In nature, the vast majority of animals rely on some degree of soft actuation and/or body deformation to achieve remarkable feats of agility, dexterity, and versatility. In this work, we introduce SoftZoo, a soft robot co-design platform for locomotion in diverse environments. SoftZoo supports an extensive, naturally-inspired material set, including the ability to simulate soft robots in environments such as flat ground, desert, wetland, clay, ice, snow, shallow water, and ocean. Furthermore, SoftZoo provides a variety of tasks relevant for soft robotics, including fast locomotion, agile turning, and path following, as well as differentiable design representations for morphology and control. We benchmark prevalent representations and co-design algorithms, and shed light on 1) the interplay between environment, morphology, and behavior; 2) the importance of design space representations; 3) the ambiguity in muscle formation and controller synthesis; and 4) the value of differentiable physics. We envision that SoftZoo will serve as a standard platform and template for the development of novel representations and algorithms for co-designing soft robots' behavioral and morphological intelligence.},

A2PO leverages the sequential updating scheme and achieves a tightness monotonic improvement bound compared with other trust region algorithms.

  abstract     = {Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) with high-fidelity approximate posteriors consistently outperform standard neural networks when the training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. However, standard BNNs do not necessarily perform well under dataset shift. We present ShiftMatch, a new training-data-dependent likelihood for robustness to corruption in BNNs. ShiftMatch is inspired by the training-data-dependent "EmpCov" priors from Izmailov et al. (2021a), and efficiently matches test-time spatial correlations to those at training time. Critically, ShiftMatch is designed to leave the neural network's training time likelihood unchanged, allowing it to use publicly available samples from pre-trained BNNs. Using pre-trained HMC samples, ShiftMatch gives strong performance improvements on CIFAR-10-C, outperforms EmpCov priors (though ShiftMatch uses extra information from a minibatch of corrupted test points), and is perhaps the first Bayesian method capable of convincingly outperforming plain deep ensembles. ShiftMatch can also be integrated with non-Bayesian methods like deep ensembles, where it offers smaller, but still considerable, performance improvements.},

Current state-of-the-art methods employ spherical harmonics to encode higher-order interactions among particles, which are computationally expensive. We propose a simple alternative functional form that uses neurally parametrized linear combinations of edge vectors to achieve equivariance, which still universally approximates node environments. We design spatial attention kinetic networks with E(n)-equivariance, or SAKE, which are competitive in many-body system modeling tasks while being significantly faster. SAKE is a new E(n)-equivariant architecture that uses spatial attention, enabling the construction of extremely performant but still accurate machine learning potentials, as well as flows capable of predicting dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Neural language models ({LM}s) have achieved impressive results on various language-based reasoning tasks by utilizing latent knowledge encoded in their own pretrained parameters. To make this reasoning process more explicit, recent works retrieve a rationalizing {LM}'s internal knowledge by training or prompting it to generate free-text rationale
s, which can be used to guide task predictions made by either the same {LM} or a separate reasoning {LM}. However, rationalizing {LM}s require expensive rationale annotation and/or computation, without any assurance that their generated rationales improve {LM} task performance or faithfully reflect {LM} decision-making. In this paper, we propose {PINTO}, an {LM} pipeline that rationalizes via prompt-based learning, and learns to faithfully reason over rationales via counterfactual regularization. First, {PINTO} maps out a suitable reasoning process for the task input by prompting a frozen rationalizing {LM} to generate a free-text rationale. Second, {PINTO}'s reasoning {LM} is fine-tuned to solve the task using the generated rationale as context, while regularized to output less confident predictions when the rationale is perturbed. Across four datasets, we show that {PINTO} significantly improves the generalization ability of the reasoning {LM}, yielding higher performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets. Also, we find that {PINTO}'s rationales are more faithful to its task predictions than those generated by competitive baselines.},

By leveraging the recent implicit neural representation techniques, particularly the appealing neural radiance fields, we introduce an object field component to learn unique codes for all individual objects in {3D} space only from {2D} supervision. The key to this component is a series of carefully designed loss functions to enable every {3D} point, especially in non-occupied space, to be effectively optimized even without {3D} labels. In addition, we introduce an inverse query algorithm to freely manipulate any specified {3D} object shape in the learned scene representation. Notably, our manipulation algorithm can explicitly tackle key issues such as object collisions and visual occlusions. The {DM}-{NeRF} method is among the first to simultaneously reconstruct, decompose, manipulate and render complex {3D} scenes in a single pipeline, allowing any interested object to be freely manipulated in {3D} space such as translation, rotation, size adjustment, and deformation. Extensive experiments on three datasets clearly show that our method can accurately decompose all {3D} objects from {2D} views, allowing any interested object to be freely manipulated in {3D} space such as translation, rotation, size adjustment, and deformation.},

This relationship was established by means of a diffusion model that learns data distributions over the stroke-point locations and pen states of real human sketches. Given randomly scattered stroke-points, sketch generation becomes a process of deformation-based denoising, where the generator rectifies positions of stroke points at each timestep to converge at a recognizable sketch. A key innovation was to embed recognizability into the reverse time diffusion process. It was observed that the estimated noise during the reversal process is strongly correlated with sketch classification accuracy. An auxiliary recurrent neural network ({RNN}) was consequently used to quantify recognizability during data sampling. It follows that, based on the recognizability scores, a sampling shortcut function can also be devised that renders better quality sketches with fewer sampling steps.},

However, extending this result to deeper networks remains to be an open problem. In this paper, we prove that the duality gap for deeper linear networks with vector outputs is non-zero. In contrast, we show that the zero duality gap can be obtained by stacking standard deep networks in parallel, which we call a parallel architecture, and modifying the regularization. Therefore, we prove the strong duality and existence of equivalent convex problems that enable globally optimal training of deep networks.},

Researchers have primarily focused on incorporating diverse structural inductive biases, e.g. attention or convolution, in modeling. The topic of inference suboptimality and an analysis of the {NP} from the optimization objective perspective has hardly been studied in earlier work. To fix this issue, we propose a surrogate objective of the target log-likelihood of the meta dataset within the expectation maximization framework. The resulting model, referred to as the Self-normalized Importance weighted Neural Process ({SI}-{NP}), can learn a more accurate functional prior and has an improvement guarantee concerning the target log-likelihood. Experimental results show the competitive performance of {SI}-{NP} over other {NP}s objectives and illustrate that structural inductive biases, such as attention modules, can also augment our method to achieve {SOTA} performance.},

  abstract     = {The classical Perceptron algorithm of Rosenblatt can be used to find a linear threshold function to correctly classify n linearly separable data points, assuming the classes are separated by some margin $\gamma > 0$. A foundational result is that Perceptron converges after $O(1/\gamma^2)$ iterations. There have been several recent works that managed to improve this rate by a quadratic factor, to $O(\sqrt{\log n}/\gamma)$, with more sophisticated algorithms. In this paper, we unify these existing results under one framework by showing that they can all be described through the lens of solving min-max problems using modern acceleration techniques, mainly through optimistic online learning. We then show that the proposed framework also leads to improved results for a series of problems beyond the standard Perceptron setting. For the margin maximization problem, we improve the state-of-the-art result from $O(\log t/t^2)$ to $O(1/t^2)$, where $t$ is the number of iterations. We provide the first result on identifying the implicit bias property of the classical Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent ({NAG}) algorithm, and show {NAG} can maximize the margin with an $O(1/t^2)$ rate. For the classical p-norm Perceptron problem, we provide an algorithm with $O(\sqrt{(p-1)\log n}/\gamma)$ convergence rate, while existing algorithms suffer the $O((p-1)/\gamma^2)$ convergence rate.},

  abstract     = {Offline reinforcement learning ({RL}), which aims to learn an optimal policy using a previously collected static dataset, is an important paradigm of {RL}. Standard {RL} methods often perform poorly in this regime due to the function approximation errors on out-of-distribution actions. While a variety of regularization methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue, they are often constrained by policy classes with limited expressiveness that can lead to highly suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose representing the policy as a diffusion model, a recent class of highly-expressive deep generative models. We introduce Diffusion Q-learning (Diffusion-{QL}) that utilizes a conditional diffusion model to represent the policy. In our approach, we learn an action-value function and we add a term maximizing action-values into the training loss of the conditional diffusion model, which results in a loss that seeks optimal actions that are near the behavior policy. We show the expressiveness of the diffusion model-based policy, and the coupling of the behavior cloning and policy improvement under the diffusion model both contribute to the outstanding performance of Diffusion-{QL}. We illustrate the superiority of our method compared to prior works in a simple {2D} bandit example with a multimodal behavior policy. We further show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the majority of the {D4RL} benchmark tasks for offline {RL}.},

Due to the distance-based nature, the network output dimensionality is flexible, and all the learnable parameters are only for data embedding. All the knowledge learnt for {I}mage{N}et classification can be completely transferred for pixel recognition learning, under the ``pre-training and fine-tuning'' paradigm. Additionally, {DNC} can even possess ad-hoc explainability when the sub-centroids are selected as actual training images that humans can view and inspect.

Existing pseudo-labeling methods commonly assume that the class distributions of training data are balanced. However, such an assumption is far from realistic scenarios and thus severely limits the performance of current pseudo-labeling methods under the context of class-imbalance. To alleviate this problem, we design a bias adaptive classifier that targets the imbalanced {SSL} setups. The core idea is to automatically assimilate the training bias caused by class imbalance via the bias adaptive classifier, which is composed of a novel bias attractor and the original linear classifier. The bias attractor is designed as a light-weight residual network and learned through a bi-level learning framework, which enables the bias adaptive classifier to fit imbalanced training data, while the linear classifier can provide unbiased label prediction for each class. We conduct extensive experiments under various imbalanced semi-supervised setups, and the results demonstrate that our method can be applied to different pseudo-labeling models and is superior to current state-of-the-art methods.},

One popular method is to prune the connections based on a certain metric, but it is not entirely clear what metric is the best choice. Recent advances in neural tangent kernel ({NTK}) theory suggest that the training dynamics of large enough neural networks is closely related to the spectrum of the {NTK}. Motivated by this finding, we propose to prune the connections that have the least influence on the spectrum of the {NTK}. This method can help maintain the {NTK} spectrum, which may help align the training dynamics to that of its dense counterpart. Our approach is weight-agnostic, which is different from most existing methods that are weight-dependent. We use random inputs to compute the fixed-weight-{NTK}, making our method data-agnostic as well. We further propose to sample multiple realizations of random weights to estimate the {NTK} spectrum. Empirically, our method achieves better performance than all baselines on multiple datasets.},

Cut selection---which aims to select a proper subset of the candidate cuts to improve the efficiency of solving {MILPs}---heavily depends on ({P1}) which cuts should be preferred, and ({P2}) how many cuts should be selected. Although many modern {MILP} solvers tackle ({P1})-({P2}) by manually designed heuristics, machine learning offers a promising approach to learn more effective heuristics from {MILPs} collected from specific applications. However, many existing learning-based methods focus on learning which cuts should be preferred, neglecting the importance of learning the number of cuts that should be selected. Moreover, we observe from extensive empirical results that ({P3}) what order of selected cuts should be preferred has a significant impact on the efficiency of solving {MILPs} as well. To address this challenge, we propose a novel hierarchical sequence model ({HEM}) to learn cut selection policies via reinforcement learning.},

With this observation, we propose a new objective of unsupervised learning for {CO} where the goal of learning is to search for good initialization for future problem instances rather than give direct solutions. We propose a meta-learning-based training pipeline for this new objective. Our method achieves good performance, and we observe that even the initial solution given by our model before fine-tuning can significantly outperform the baselines under various evaluation settings including evaluation across multiple datasets. We observe that graph neural networks used to encode regular graphs suffer from the node ambiguity issue due to their limited expressive power, and previous models did not learn from history but were directly optimized over each testing case, which tends to be trapped into local optimum.},

  abstract     = {Many fundamental properties of a quantum system are captured by its {Hamiltonian} and ground state. Despite the significance, ground states preparation ({GSP}) is classically intractable for large-scale {Hamiltonians}. Quantum neural networks ({QNNs}), which exert the power of modern quantum machines, have emerged as a leading protocol to conquer this issue. As such, the performance enhancement of {QNNs} becomes the core in {GSP}. Empirical evidence showed that {QNNs} with handcraft symmetric ansätze generally experience better trainability than those with asymmetric ansätze, while theoretical explanations remain vague. To fill this knowledge gap, we propose the effective quantum neural tangent kernel ({EQNTK}) and connect this concept with over-parameterization theory to quantify the convergence of {QNNs} towards the global optima. We uncover that the advance of symmetric ansätze attributes to their large {EQNTK} value with low effective dimension, which requests few parameters. We prove how the symmetry enhances the training performance of {QNNs} and then devise an efficient symmetric pruning scheme to distill a symmetric ansatz from an over-parameterized and asymmetric ansatz.},

  abstract     = {We consider representation learning for proteins with {3D} structures. We build {3D} graphs based on protein structures and develop graph networks to learn their representations. Existing work often uses graph networks to capture relations among amino acids. We propose a novel hierarchical graph network called {ProNet} to capture hierarchical relations among different levels of protein structures. {ProNet} is very flexible and can be used to compute protein representations at different levels of granularity, including amino acid level, backbone level, and all-atom level. We observe that there exist hierarchical relations among different levels, which {ProNet} can capture effectively. This enables {ProNet} to use information from different levels for downstream tasks, which is essential since different downstream tasks may require different levels of information. We conduct extensive experiments on enzyme function prediction, fold classification, and reaction classification tasks. Results show that {ProNet} outperforms recent methods on most datasets. We also conduct ablation studies to validate our design choices and analyze the hierarchical relations learned by {ProNet}.},

  abstract     = {Graph Neural Networks ({GNNs}) have shown great promise in various graph learning tasks. However, the computational overheads of fitting {GNNs} to large-scale graphs grow rapidly, posing obstacles to {GNNs} from scaling up to real-world applications. To tackle this issue, Graph Lottery Ticket ({GLT}) hypothesis articulates that there always exists a sparse subnetwork/subgraph with admirable performance in {GNNs} with random initialization. Such a pair of core subgraph and sparse subnetwork (called graph lottery tickets) can be uncovered by iteratively applying a novel sparsification method. While {GLT} provides new insights for {GNN} compression, it requires a full pretraining process to obtain graph lottery tickets, which is not universal and friendly to real-world applications. Moreover, the graph sparsification in {GLT} utilizes sampling techniques, which may result in massive information loss and aggregation failure. In this paper, we explore the searching of graph lottery tickets from a complementary perspective -- transforming a random ticket into a graph lottery ticket, which allows us to more comprehensively explore the relationships between the original network/graph and their sparse counterpart. To achieve this, we propose regularization-based network pruning and hierarchical graph sparsification, leading to our Dual Graph Lottery Ticket ({DGLT}) framework for a joint sparsification of network and graph. Compared to {GLT}, our {DGLT} helps achieve a triple-win situation of graph lottery tickets with high sparsity, admirable performance, and good explainability.},

To avoid excessive computation, extracting and training only on the most informative subset is drawing increasing attention. Nevertheless, it is still an open question how to select such a subset on which the model trained generalizes on par with the full data. In this paper, we propose dynamic margin selection ({DynaMS}). {DynaMS} leverages the distance from candidate samples to the classification boundary to construct the subset, and the subset is dynamically updated during model training. We show that {DynaMS} converges with large probability, and for the first time show both in theory and practice that dynamically updating the subset can result in better generalization over previous works. To reduce the additional computation incurred by the selection, a light parameter sharing proxy ({PSP}) is designed. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

Our theoretical analysis illuminates the factors that affect the {UDA} performance and provides insights on the design of better {UDA} algorithms. In particular, we show that reducing the divergence between the source and target feature distributions is not the only way to improve {UDA} performance. Instead, the representation should be designed to reduce the uncertainty of the optimal target predictor given the data. Based on our analysis, we propose two techniques to improve generalization in {UDA}: spectral filtering and uncertainty-guided self-training. We validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed techniques on several benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Robots operating in the real world require both rich manipulation skills as well as the ability to semantically reason about when to apply those skills. Towards this goal, recent works have integrated semantic representations from large-scale pretrained vision-language models into manipulation models, imparting them with more general reasoning capabilities. However, we show that the conventional pretraining-finetuning pipeline for integrating such representations entangles the learning of domain-specific action information and domain-general visual information, leading to less data-efficient training and poor generalization to unseen objects and tasks. To this end, we propose {ProgramPort}, a modular approach to better leverage pretrained {VL} models by exploiting the syntactic and semantic structures of language instructions. Our framework uses a semantic parser to recover an executable program, composed of functional modules grounded on vision and action across different modalities. Each functional module is realized as a combination of deterministic computation and learnable neural networks. Program execution produces parameters to general manipulation primitives for a robotic end-effector. The entire modular network can be trained with end-to-end imitation learning objectives. Experiments show that our model successfully disentangles action and perception, translating to improved zero-shot and compositional generalization in a variety of manipulation behaviors.},

Trigger inversion is an effective way of identifying backdoor models and understanding embedded adversarial behaviors. A challenge of trigger inversion is that there are many ways of constructing the trigger. Existing methods cannot generalize to various types of triggers by making certain assumptions or attack-specific constraints. The fundamental reason is that existing work does not formally define the trigger inversion problem. This work formally defines and analyzes the triggers injected in different spaces and the inversion problem. Then, it proposes a unified framework to invert backdoor triggers based on the formalization of triggers and the identified inner behaviors of backdoor models from our analysis.},

How can we use the implicit knowledge in the parameters of smaller, extant models to enable faster training of newer, larger models? This paper describes an approach for accelerating transformer training by learning to grow pretrained transformers, where we learn to linearly map the parameters of the smaller model to initialize the larger model. For tractable learning, we factorize the linear transformation as a composition of (linear) width- and depth-growth operators, and further employ a Kronecker factorization of these growth operators to encode architectural knowledge.},

We then learn multiplicative low rank updates to this shared prompt to efficiently adapt it to each downstream target task. Extensive experiments on 23 {NLP} datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including the full finetuning baseline in some cases, despite only tuning 0.035\% as many task-specific parameters.},

The proposed solver learns to predict the variables that should be selected to form the optimal solution via a neural network with gradient descent. To handle the discrete constraints of combinatorial optimization, we propose optimal transport-based cardinality constraint encoding for end-to-end learning with two variants: Sinkhorn and Gumbel-Sinkhorn, whereby the violation of the constraints can be exactly characterized and bounded by theoretical results. On synthetic and real-world combinatorial optimization problem instances, our methods surpass the state-of-the-art neural combinatorial solvers and are comparable to (if not superior to) the commercial solver Gurobi.},

Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal entropy score ({STEntr-Score}) with a refinement factor to handle the discrepancy of visual information in spatial and temporal dimensions, through dynamically leveraging the correlation between the feature map size and kernel size depth-wisely. Highly efficient and expressive {3D} {CNN} architectures, i.e., entropy-based {3D} {CNNs} ({E3D} family), can then be efficiently searched by maximizing the {STEntr-Score} under a given computational budget, via an evolutionary algorithm without training the network parameters.},

Given that {KGs} are usually incomplete, neural models are proposed to answer the logical queries by parameterizing set operators with complex neural networks. However, such methods usually train neural set operators with a large number of entity and relation embeddings from scratch, where whether and how the embeddings or the neural set operators contribute to the performance remains unclear. In this paper, we propose a simple framework for complex query answering that decomposes the {KG} embeddings from neural set operators. We propose to represent the complex queries into the query graph. On top of the query graph, we propose the Logical Message Passing Neural Network ({LMPNN}) that connects the local one-hop inferences on atomic formulas to the global logical reasoning for complex query answering. We leverage existing effective {KG} embeddings to conduct one-hop inferences on atomic formulas, the results of which are regarded as the messages passed in {LMPNN}. The reasoning process over the overall logical formulas is turned into the forward pass of {LMPNN} that incrementally aggregates local information to finally predict the answers' embeddings.},

Just like in {NLP} where one can study language by investigating what a language model learns, this approach opens the door to investigating the brain by what a model of the brain learns. As a first step along this path, we demonstrate a new analysis of the intrinsic dimensionality of the computations in different areas of the brain. To construct these representations, we combine a technique for producing super-resolution spectrograms of neural data with an approach designed for generating contextual representations of audio by masking. In the future, far more concepts will be decodable from neural recordings by using representation learning, potentially unlocking the brain like language models unlocked language.},

Our explanation encompasses 28 attention heads grouped into 7 main classes, which we discovered using a combination of interpretability approaches including causal interventions and projections. To our knowledge, this investigation is the largest end-to-end attempt at reverse-engineering a natural behavior ``in the wild'' in a language model. We evaluate the reliability of our explanation using three quantitative criteria - faithfulness, completeness and minimality. Though these criteria support our explanation, they also point to remaining gaps in our understanding. Our work provides evidence that a mechanistic understanding of large {ML} models is feasible, opening opportunities to scale our understanding to both larger models and more complex tasks.},

In the proposed framework, we model energy estimation and data restoration as the forward and backward passes of a single network without any auxiliary components, e.g., an extra decoder. For the forward pass, we fit a network to an energy function that assigns low energy scores to samples that belong to an unlabeled dataset, and high energy otherwise. For the backward pass, we restore data from corrupted versions iteratively using gradient-based optimization along the direction of energy minimization. In this way, we naturally fold the encoder-decoder architecture widely used in masked image modeling into the forward and backward passes of a single vision model. The proposed method supports a wide range of pretext tasks with different data corruption methods, and permits models to be pretrained from masked image modeling, patch sorting, and image restoration, including super-resolution, denoising, and colorization. The proposed method delivers comparable and even better performance with remarkably fewer epochs of training compared to the state-of-the-art self-supervised vision model pretraining methods.},

  abstract     = {Quasar convexity is a condition that allows some first-order methods to efficiently minimize a function even when the optimization landscape is non-convex. Previous works develop near-optimal accelerated algorithms for minimizing this class of functions, however, they require a subroutine of binary search which results in multiple calls to gradient evaluations in each iteration, and consequently the total number of gradient evaluations does not match a known lower bound. In this work, we show that a recently proposed continuized {N}esterov acceleration can be applied to minimizing quasar convex functions and achieves the optimal bound with a high probability. Furthermore, we find that the objective functions of training generalized linear models ({GLM}s) satisfy quasar convexity, which broadens the applicability of the relevant algorithms, while known practical examples of quasar convexity in non-convex learning are sparse in the literature.},

A common idea in most of the related works is constructing pseudo-labels for the unlabeled test samples and applying gradient descent ({GD}) to a loss function with the pseudo-labels. Recently, Goyal et al. (2022) propose conjugate labels, which is a new kind of pseudo-labels for self-training at test time. They empirically show that the conjugate label outperforms other ways of pseudo-labeling on many domain adaptation benchmarks. However, provably showing that {GD} with conjugate labels learns a good classifier for test-time adaptation remains open. In this work, we aim at theoretically understanding {GD} with hard and conjugate labels for a binary classification problem. We show that for square loss, {GD} with conjugate labels converges to an $\epsilon$-optimal predictor under a {G}aussian model for any arbitrarily small $\epsilon$, while {GD} with hard pseudo-labels fails in this task.},

  abstract     = {{H}amiltonian {M}onte {C}arlo ({HMC}) is a popular method in sampling. While there are quite a few works of studying this method on various aspects, an interesting question is how to choose its integration time to achieve acceleration. In this work, we consider accelerating the process of sampling from a distribution $\pi(x) \propto \exp(-f(x))$ via {HMC} via time-varying integration time. When the potential $f$ is $L$-smooth and $m$-strongly convex, i.e. for sampling from a log-smooth and strongly log-concave target distribution $\pi$, it is known that under a constant integration time, the number of iterations that ideal {HMC} takes to get an $\epsilon$ {W}asserstein-2 distance to the target $\pi$ is $O(\kappa \log 1/\epsilon)$, where $\kappa := L/m$ is the condition number. We propose a scheme of time-varying integration time based on the roots of {C}hebyshev polynomials. We show that in the case of quadratic potential $f$, i.e. when the target $\pi$ is a {G}aussian distribution, ideal {HMC} with this choice of integration time only takes $O(\sqrt{\kappa} \log 1/\epsilon)$ number of iterations to reach {W}asserstein-2 distance less than $\epsilon$; this improvement on the dependence on condition number is akin to acceleration in optimization. The design and analysis of {HMC} with the proposed integration time is built on the tools of {C}hebyshev polynomials. Experiments find the advantage of adopting our scheme of time-varying integration time even for sampling from distributions with smooth strongly convex potentials that are not quadratic.},

To investigate the problem, we aim to answer several key questions in this paper: how pre-trained language models perform in antibody tasks with different specificity and how introducing specific biological knowledge affects performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four different antibody prediction tasks and compare the performance of various pre-trained language models with different scales and training strategies. The results demonstrate that pre-training with biological knowledge can significantly improve antibody-related tasks' performance, particularly when the training data is limited. Furthermore, we observe that antibody-specific pre-trained models offer better performance than general protein pre-trained models when handling antibody-related tasks.},

To address this issue, we propose a novel {OE}-based approach that makes the model perform well for unseen {OOD} situations. It leads to a min-max learning scheme---searching to synthesize {OOD} data that leads to worst judgments and learning from such {OOD} data for the uniform performance in {OOD} detection. In our realization, these worst {OOD} data are synthesized by transforming original surrogate ones, where the associated transform functions are learned implicitly based on our novel insight that model perturbation leads to data transformation.},

However, in many applications, the performance of the system is more sensitive to the ``bad'' agent---the agent with the worst individual performance. In {CM2AB}, maximizing the group performance is equivalent to minimizing the group regret of all agents, and minimizing the individual performance can be measured by minimizing the maximum (worst) individual regret among agents. Minimizing the maximum individual regret was largely ignored in prior literature, and currently, there is little work on how to minimize this objective with a low communication overhead. In this paper, we propose a near-optimal algorithm on both individual and group regrets, in addition, we also propose a novel communication module in the algorithm, which only needs $O(\log(\log T))$ communication times where $T$ is the number of decision rounds. We also conduct simulations to illustrate the advantage of our algorithm by comparing it to other known baselines.},

Given the goal of learning local policies that enable decentralized execution, agents are commonly assumed to be independent of each other, even in centralized training. However, such an assumption may prohibit agents from learning the optimal joint policy. To address this problem, we explicitly take the dependency among agents into centralized training. Although this leads to the optimal joint policy, it may not be factorized for decentralized execution. Nevertheless, we theoretically show that from such a joint policy, we can always derive another joint policy that achieves the same optimality but can be factorized for decentralized execution. To this end, we propose multi-agent conditional policy factorization ({MACPF}), which takes more centralized training but still enables decentralized execution. We empirically verify {MACPF} in various cooperative {MARL} tasks and demonstrate that {MACPF} achieves better performance or faster convergence than baselines.},

The dynamics of the system is a reaction-diffusion process which can separate particles without blowing up. This induces an {Allen-Cahn} message passing ({ACMP}) for graph neural networks where the numerical iteration for the particle system solution constitutes the message passing propagation. {ACMP} which has a simple implementation with a neural {ODE} solver can propel the network depth up to one hundred of layers with theoretically proven strictly positive lower bound of the {Dirichlet} energy.

So, it is often challenging to design an {HNN} that suffices to express those relations while keeping computational efficiency. Inspired by hypergraph diffusion algorithms, this work proposes a new {HNN} architecture named {ED-HNN}, which provably represents any continuous equivariant hypergraph diffusion operators that can model a wide range of higher-order relations. {ED-HNN} can be implemented efficiently by combining star expansions of hypergraphs with standard message passing neural networks. {ED-HNN} further shows great superiority in processing heterophilic hypergraphs and constructing deep models. We evaluate {ED-HNN} for node classification on nine real-world hypergraph datasets. {ED-HNN} uniformly outperforms the best baselines over these nine datasets and achieves more than 2\%↑ in prediction accuracy over four datasets therein.},

  abstract     = {Few-Shot Learning ({FSL}) aims to learn a simple and effective bias on limited novel samples. Recently, many methods have been focused on re-training a randomly initialized linear classifier to adapt it to the novel features extracted by the pre-trained feature extractor (called Linear-Probing-based methods). These methods typically assumed the pre-trained feature extractor was robust enough, i.e., finetuning was not needed, and hence the pre-trained feature extractor does not change on the novel samples. However, the unchanged pre-trained feature extractor will distort the features of novel samples because the robustness assumption may not hold, especially on the out-of-distribution samples. To extract the undistorted features, we designed Linear-Probing-Finetuning with Firth-Bias ({LP-FT-FB}) to yield an accurate bias on the limited samples for better finetuning the pre-trained feature extractor, providing stronger transferring ability. In {LP-FT-FB}, we further proposed inverse Firth Bias Reduction (i-{FBR}) to regularize the over-parameterized feature extractor on which {FBR} does not work well. The proposed i-{FBR} effectively alleviates the over-fitting problem of the feature extractor in the process of finetuning and helps extract undistorted novel features. To show the effectiveness of the designed {LP-FT-FB}, we conducted a lot of experiments on the commonly used {FSL} datasets under different backbones, including in-domain and cross-domain {FSL} tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed {FT-LP-FB} outperforms the {SOTA} {FSL} methods.},

In this paper, we propose Diffusion-{GAN}, a novel {GAN} framework that leverages a forward diffusion chain to generate {Gaussian}-mixture distributed instance noise. Diffusion-{GAN} consists of three components, including an adaptive diffusion process, a diffusion timestep-dependent discriminator, and a generator. Both the observed and generated data are diffused by the same adaptive diffusion process. At each diffusion timestep, there is a different noise-to-data ratio and the timestep-dependent discriminator learns to distinguish the diffused real data from the diffused generated data. The generator learns from the discriminator's feedback by backpropagating through the forward diffusion chain, whose length is adaptively adjusted to balance the noise and data levels. We theoretically show that the discriminator's timestep-dependent strategy gives consistent and helpful guidance to the generator, enabling it to match the true data distribution. We demonstrate the advantages of Diffusion-{GAN} over strong {GAN} baselines on various datasets, showing that it can produce more realistic images with higher stability and data efficiency than state-of-the-art {GANs}.},

Recently, studying exploration in procedurally-generated environments has drawn increasing attention. Existing works generally combine lifelong intrinsic rewards and episodic intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration. Though various lifelong and episodic intrinsic rewards have been proposed, the individual contributions of the two kinds of intrinsic rewards to improving exploration are barely investigated. To bridge this gap, we disentangle these two parts and conduct ablative experiments. Experimental results show that only using episodic intrinsic rewards can match or surpass prior state-of-the-art methods. On the other hand, only using lifelong intrinsic rewards hardly makes progress in exploration. This demonstrates that episodic intrinsic reward is more crucial than lifelong one in boosting exploration. Moreover, we find through experimental analysis that the lifelong intrinsic reward does not accurately reflect the novelty of states, which explains why it does not help much in improving exploration.},

Unfortunately, the majority of real-world data are unlabeled and can be highly heterogeneous across sources. In this work, we carefully study decentralized learning with unlabeled data through the lens of self-supervised learning ({SSL}), specifically contrastive visual representation learning. We study the effectiveness of a range of contrastive learning algorithms under decentralized learning settings, on relatively large-scale datasets including {ImageNet}-100, {MS}-{COCO}, and a new real-world robotic warehouse dataset. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into understanding why data heterogeneity is less of a concern for Dec-{SSL} objectives, and introduce feature alignment and clustering techniques to develop a new Dec-{SSL} algorithm that further improves the performance, in the face of highly non-{IID} data. Our study presents positive evidence to embrace unlabeled data in decentralized learning, and we hope to provide new insights into whether and why decentralized {SSL} is effective and/or even advantageous.},

We demonstrate that stochastic conditioning yields much more 3D consistent results compared to the naive sampling process which only conditions on a single previous frame. We compare 3DiMs to prior work on the SRN ShapeNet dataset, demonstrating that 3DiM's generated videos from a single view achieve much higher fidelity while being approximately 3D consistent. We also introduce a new evaluation methodology, 3D consistency scoring, to measure the 3D consistency of a generated object by training a neural field on the model's output views. 3DiMs are geometry free, do not rely on hyper-networks or test-time optimization for novel view synthesis, and allow a single model to easily scale to a large number of scenes.},

  abstract     = {There has been growing interest in automatically predicting missing type annotations in programs written in Python and JavaScript. While prior methods have achieved impressive accuracy when predicting the most common types, they often perform poorly on rare or complex types. In this paper, we present a new type inference method that treats type prediction as a code infilling task by leveraging CodeT5, a state-of-the-art seq2seq pre-trained language model for code. Our method uses static analysis to construct dynamic contexts for each code element whose type signature is to be predicted by the model. We also propose an iterative decoding scheme that incorporates previous type predictions in the model's input context, allowing information exchange between related code elements. Our evaluation shows that the proposed approach, TypeT5, not only achieves a higher overall accuracy (particularly on rare and complex types) but also produces more coherent results with fewer type errors---while enabling easy user intervention.},

  abstract     = {The generalization ability of machine learning models degrades significantly when the test distribution shifts away from the training distribution. We investigate the problem of training models that are robust to shifts caused by changes in the distribution of class-priors or group-priors. The presence of skewed training priors can often lead to the models overfitting to spurious features. Unlike existing methods, which optimize for either the worst or the average performance over classes or groups, our work is motivated by the need for finer control over the robustness properties of the model. We present an extremely lightweight post-hoc approach that performs scaling adjustments to predictions from a pre-trained model, with the goal of minimizing a distributionally robust loss around a chosen target distribution. These adjustments are computed by solving a constrained optimization problem on a validation set and applied to the model during test time. Our constrained optimization objective is inspired from a natural notion of robustness to controlled distribution shifts. Our method comes with provable guarantees and empirically makes a strong case for distributional robust post-hoc classifiers.

Language models, whether fine-tuned or prompted with few-shot demonstrations, frequently violate these constraints, and lack a mechanism to iteratively revise their outputs. Moreover, some powerful language models are of extreme scale or inaccessible, making it inefficient, if not infeasible, to update their parameters for task-specific adaptation. We present Self-Correction, an approach that decouples an imperfect base generator (an off-the-shelf language model or supervised sequence-to-sequence model) from a separate corrector that learns to iteratively correct imperfect generations. To train the corrector, we propose an online training procedure that can use either scalar or natural language feedback on intermediate imperfect generations. We show that Self-Correction improves upon the base generator in three diverse generation tasks - mathematical program synthesis, lexically-constrained generation, and toxicity control - even when the corrector is much smaller than the base generator.},

  abstract     = {Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is a highly effective regularization technique for improving the generalization of deep neural networks for various settings. However, the underlying working of SAM remains elusive because of various intriguing approximations in the theoretical characterizations. SAM intends to penalize a notion of sharpness of the model but implements a computationally efficient variant; moreover, a third notion of sharpness was used for proving generalization guarantees. The subtle differences in these notions of sharpness can indeed lead to significantly different empirical results. This paper rigorously nails down the exact sharpness notion that SAM regularizes and clarifies the underlying mechanism. We also show that the two steps of approximations in the original motivation of SAM individually lead to inaccurate local conclusions, but their combination accidentally reveals the correct effect, when full-batch gradients are applied. Furthermore, we also prove that the stochastic version of SAM in fact regularizes the third notion of sharpness mentioned above, which is most likely to be the preferred notion for practical performance. The key mechanism behind this intriguing phenomenon is the alignment between the gradient and the top eigenvector of Hessian when SAM is applied.},

However, existing methods only utilize the unaltered target sample or simple augmentations of the target to compute statistics. Such a sparse sampling of the model's behavior carries little information, leading to poor inference capabilities. In this work, we use adversarial tools to directly optimize for queries that are discriminative and diverse. Our improvements achieve significantly more accurate membership inference than existing methods, especially in offline scenarios and in the low false-positive regime which is critical in legal settings.},

We start with the observation that a ResNet model overfits benignly on Cifar10 but not benignly on ImageNet. To understand why benign overfitting fails in the ImageNet experiment, we theoretically analyze benign overfitting under a more restrictive setup where the number of parameters is not significantly larger than the number of data points. Under this mild overparameterization setup, our analysis identifies a phase change: unlike in the previous heavy overparameterization settings, benign overfitting can now fail in the presence of label noise. Our analysis explains our empirical observations, and is validated by a set of control experiments with ResNets. Our work highlights the importance of understanding implicit bias in underfitting regimes as a future direction.},

  abstract     = {High-quality instance segmentation has shown emerging importance in computer vision. Without any refinement, DCT-Mask directly generates high-resolution masks by compressed vectors. To further refine masks obtained by compressed vectors, we propose for the first time a compressed vector based multi-stage refinement framework. However, the vanilla combination does not bring significant gains, because changes in some elements of the DCT vector will affect the prediction of the entire mask. Thus, we propose a simple and novel method named PatchDCT, which separates the mask decoded from a DCT vector into several patches and refines each patch by the designed classifier and regressor. Specifically, the classifier is used to distinguish mixed patches from all patches, and to correct previously mispredicted foreground and background patches. In contrast, the regressor is used for DCT vector prediction of mixed patches, further refining the segmentation quality at boundary locations. Experiments on COCO show that our method achieves 2.0%, 3.2%, 4.5% AP and 3.4%, 5.3%, 7.0% Boundary AP improvements over Mask-RCNN on COCO, LVIS, and Cityscapes, respectively. It also surpasses DCT-Mask by 0.7%, 1.1%, 1.3% AP and 0.9%, 1.7%, 4.2% Boundary AP on COCO, LVIS and Cityscapes.

We demonstrate these constraints lead to disentanglement in a variety of tasks and architectures, including variational autoencoders. We also use this theory to explain why the brain partitions its cells into distinct cell types such as grid and object-vector cells, and also explain when the brain instead entangles representations in response to entangled task factors. Overall, this work provides a mathematical understanding of why single neurons in the brain often represent single human-interpretable factors, and steps towards an understanding task structure shapes the structure of brain representation.},

Relying on constraint relaxation techniques from non-convex optimization, we develop a method that upper-bounds the largest change an adversary can make to a gradient-based explanation via bounded manipulation of either the input features or model parameters. By propagating a compact input or parameter set as symbolic intervals through the forwards and backwards computations of the neural network we can formally certify the robustness of gradient-based explanations. Our bounds are differentiable, hence we can incorporate provable explanation robustness into neural network training. Empirically, our method surpasses the robustness provided by previous heuristic approaches. We find that our training method is the only method able to learn neural networks with certificates of explanation robustness across all six datasets tested.},

  abstract     = {The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has experienced a dramatic leap in capabilities with the recent introduction of huge Language Models (LMs). Despite this success, natural language problems that involve several compounded steps are still practically unlearnable, even by the largest LMs. This complies with experimental failures for end-to-end learning of composite problems that were demonstrated in a variety of domains. An effective mitigation is to introduce intermediate supervision for solving sub-tasks of the compounded problem. Recently, several works have demonstrated high gains by taking a straightforward approach for incorporating intermediate supervision in compounded natural language problems: the sequence-to-sequence LM is fed with an augmented input, in which the decomposed tasks' labels are simply concatenated to the original input. In this paper, we prove a positive learning result that motivates these recent efforts. We show that when concatenating intermediate supervision to the input and training a sequence-to-sequence model on this modified input, unlearnable composite problems can become learnable. We show that this is true for any family of tasks which on the one hand, are unlearnable, and on the other hand, can be decomposed into a polynomial number of simple sub-tasks, each of which depends only on $O(1)$ previous sub-task results. Beyond motivating contemporary empirical efforts for incorporating intermediate supervision in sequence-to-sequence language models, our positive theoretical result is the first of its kind in the landscape of results on the benefits of intermediate supervision for neural-network learning: Until now, all theoretical results on the subject are negative, i.e., show cases where learning is impossible without intermediate supervision, while our result is positive, showing that learning is facilitated in the presence of intermediate supervision.},

We ask if machines -- specifically, artificial intelligence (AI) navigation agents -- also build implicit (or `mental') maps. A positive answer to this question would (a) explain the surprising phenomenon in recent literature of ostensibly map-free neural-networks achieving strong performance, and (b) strengthen the evidence of mapping as a fundamental mechanism for navigation by intelligent embodied agents, whether they be biological or artificial. Unlike animal navigation, we can judiciously design the agent's perceptual system and control the learning paradigm to nullify alternative navigation mechanisms. Specifically, we train `blind' agents -- with sensing limited to only egomotion and no other sensing of any kind -- to perform PointGoal navigation (`go to $\Delta x$, $\Delta y$') via reinforcement learning. Our agents are composed of navigation-agnostic components (fully-connected and recurrent neural networks), and our experimental setup provides no inductive bias towards mapping. Despite these harsh conditions, we find that blind agents are (1) surprisingly effective navigators in new environments ($\sim$95\% success); (2) they utilize memory over long horizons (remembering $\sim$1,000 steps of past experience in an episode); (3) this memory enables them to exhibit intelligent behavior (following walls, detecting collisions, taking shortcuts); (4) there is emergence of maps and collision detection neurons in the representations of the environment built by a blind agent as it navigates; and (5) the emergent maps are selective and task dependent (e.g. the agent `forgets' exploratory detours). Overall, this paper presents no new techniques for the AI audience, but a surprising finding, an insight, and an explanation.},

In practice, to accommodate noise in the data, algorithms that construct generators of the approximate vanishing ideal are widely studied but their computational complexities remain expensive. In this paper, we scale up the oracle approximate vanishing ideal algorithm (OAVI), the only generator-constructing algorithm with known learning guarantees. We prove that the computational complexity of OAVI is not superlinear, as previously claimed, but linear in the number of samples $m$. In addition, we propose two modifications that accelerate OAVI's training time: Our analysis reveals that replacing the pairwise conditional gradients algorithm, one of the solvers used in OAVI, with the faster blended pairwise conditional gradients algorithm leads to an exponential speed-up in the number of features $n$. Finally, using a new inverse Hessian boosting approach, intermediate convex optimization problems can be solved almost instantly, improving OAVI's training time by multiple orders of magnitude in a variety of numerical experiments.},

While this problem has classically been studied in security literature, recent advances in generative models have led to a shared interest among security and machine learning researchers in developing scalable steganography techniques. In this work, we show that a steganography procedure is perfectly secure under Cachin (1998)'s information theoretic-model of steganography if and only if it is induced by a coupling. Furthermore, we show that, among perfectly secure procedures, a procedure is maximally efficient if and only if it is induced by a minimum entropy coupling. These insights yield what are, to the best of our knowledge, the first steganography algorithms to achieve perfect security guarantees with non-trivial efficiency; additionally, these algorithms are highly scalable. To provide empirical validation, we compare a minimum entropy coupling-based approach to three modern baselines---arithmetic coding, Meteor, and adaptive dynamic grouping---using GPT-2, WaveRNN, and Image Transformer as communication channels. We find that the minimum entropy coupling-based approach achieves superior encoding efficiency, despite its stronger security constraints. In aggregate, these results suggest that it may be natural to view information-theoretic steganography through the lens of minimum entropy coupling.},

Recent techniques can accelerate unguided sampling by applying high-order numerical methods to the sampling process when viewed as differential equations. On the contrary, we discover that the same techniques do not work for guided sampling, and little has been explored about its acceleration. This paper explores the culprit of this problem and provides a solution based on operator splitting methods, motivated by our key finding that classical high-order numerical methods are unsuitable for the conditional function. Our proposed method can re-utilize the high-order methods for guided sampling and can generate images with the same quality as a 250-step DDIM baseline using 32--58\% less sampling time on ImageNet256.

  abstract     = {Acquiring labeled data is challenging in many machine learning applications with limited budgets. Active learning gives a procedure to select the most informative data points and improve data efficiency by reducing the cost of labeling. The info-max learning principle maximizing mutual information such as BALD has been successful and widely adapted in various active learning applications. However, this pool-based specific objective inherently introduces a redundant selection and further requires a high computational cost for batch selection. In this paper, we design and propose a new uncertainty measure, Balanced Entropy Acquisition (BalEntAcq), which captures the information balance between the uncertainty of underlying softmax probability and the label variable. To do this, we approximate each marginal distribution by Beta distribution. Beta approximation enables us to formulate BalEntAcq as a ratio between an augmented entropy and the marginalized joint entropy. The closed-form expression of BalEntAcq facilitates parallelization by estimating two parameters in each marginal Beta distribution. BalEntAcq is a purely standalone measure without requiring any relational computations with other data points. Nevertheless, BalEntAcq captures a well-diversified selection near the decision boundary with a margin, unlike other existing uncertainty measures such as BALD, Entropy, or Mean Standard Deviation (MeanSD). Finally, we demonstrate that our balanced entropy learning principle with BalEntAcq consistently outperforms well-known linearly scalable active learning methods, including a recently proposed PowerBALD, a simple but diversified version of BALD, by showing experimental results obtained from MNIST, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and TinyImageNet datasets.},

The reason is the conventional learning rule, backpropagation, should temporarily store input activations of all the layers in the network. To overcome this, recent studies suggested various memory-efficient implementations of backpropagation. However, those approaches incur computational overhead due to the recomputation of activations, slowing down neural network training. In this work, we propose a new learning rule which significantly reduces memory requirements while closely matching the performance of backpropagation. The algorithm combines auxiliary activation with output activation during forward propagation, while only auxiliary activation is used during backward propagation instead of actual input activation to reduce the amount of data to be temporarily stored. We mathematically show that our learning rule can reliably train networks whose loss landscape is convex if the auxiliary activation satisfies certain conditions, and we suggest candidates of auxiliary activation that satisfy those conditions. Experimental results confirm that the proposed learning rule achieves competitive performance compared to backpropagation in various models such as ResNet, Transformer, BERT, ViT, and MLP-Mixer.},

The most critical issue is how to align the output features of different models. Despite the great progress, existing approaches apply strong constraints so that features or neighbor structures are strictly aligned across different models. However, such a one-to-one constraint is too strict to be well preserved for the query models with low capacity. Considering that the primary concern of the users is the rank of the returned images, we propose a generic rank preserving framework, which achieves feature compatibility and the order consistency between query and gallery models simultaneously. Specifically, we propose two alternatives to instantiate the framework. One realizes straightforward rank order preservation by directly preserving the consistency of the sorting results. To make sorting process differentiable, the Heaviside step function in sorting is approximated by the sigmoid function. The other aims to preserve a learnable monotonic mapping relationship between the returned similarity scores of query and gallery models. The mapped similarity scores of gallery model are considered as pseudo-supervision to guide the query model training. Extensive experiments on various large-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of our two proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the responses of a cell under perturbations may bring important benefits to drug discovery and personalized therapeutics. In this work, we propose a novel graph variational Bayesian causal inference framework to predict a cell's gene expressions under counterfactual perturbations (perturbations that this cell did not factually receive), leveraging information representing biological knowledge in the form of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to aid individualized cellular response predictions. Aiming at a data-adaptive GRN, we also developed an adjacency matrix updating technique for graph convolutional networks and used it to refine GRNs during pre-training, which generated more insights on gene relations and enhanced model performance. Additionally, we propose a robust estimator within our framework for the asymptotically efficient estimation of marginal perturbation effect, which is yet to be carried out in previous works. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple simulated and real-world single-cell RNA-seq datasets, and our approach demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in predicting cellular responses to unseen perturbations.},

  abstract     = {In the past decades, many large graphs with millions of nodes have been collected/constructed. The high computational cost and significant visualization difficulty hinder the analysis of large graphs. To overcome the difficulties, researchers have developed many graph subsampling approaches to provide a rough sketch that preserves global properties. By selecting representative nodes, these graph subsampling methods can help researchers estimate the graph statistics, e.g., the number of communities, of the large graph from the subsample. However, the available subsampling methods, e.g., degree node sampler and random walk sampler, tend to leave out minority communities because nodes with high degrees are more likely to be sampled. To overcome the shortcomings of the existing methods, we are motivated to apply the community information hidden in the graph to the subsampling method. Though the community structure is unavailable, community structure information can be obtained by applying geometric methods to a graph. An analog of {Ricci} curvature in the manifold is defined for the graph, i.e., {Ollivier} {Ricci} curvature. Based on the asymptotic results about the within-community edge and between-community edge's {OR} curvature, we propose a subsampling algorithm based on our theoretical results, the {Ollivier}-{Ricci} curvature {Gradient}-based subsampling ({ORG}-sub) algorithm. The proposed {ORG}-sub algorithm has two main contributions: First, {ORG}-sub provides a rigorous theoretical guarantee that the probability of {ORG}-sub taking all communities into the final subgraph converges to one. Second, extensive experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Witnessing the impressive achievements of pre-training techniques on large-scale data in the field of computer vision and natural language processing, we wonder whether this idea could be adapted in a grab-and-go spirit, and mitigate the sample inefficiency problem for visuomotor driving. Given the highly dynamic and variant nature of the input, the visuomotor driving task inherently lacks the view and translation invariance, and the visual input contains massive irrelevant information for decision making, resulting in predominant pre-training approaches from general vision less suitable for the autonomous driving task. To this end, we propose {PPGeo} ({Policy} {Pre}-training via {Geometric} modeling), an intuitive and straightforward fully self-supervised framework curated for the policy pre-training in visuomotor driving. We aim at learning policy representations as a powerful abstraction by modeling 3{D} geometric scenes on large-scale unlabeled and uncalibrated {YouTube} driving videos. The proposed {PPGeo} is performed in two stages to support effective self-supervised training. In the first stage, the geometric modeling framework generates pose and depth predictions simultaneously, with two consecutive frames as input. In the second stage, the visual encoder learns driving policy representation by predicting the future ego-motion and optimizing with the photometric error based on current visual observation only. As such, the pre-trained visual encoder is equipped with rich driving policy related representations and thereby competent for multiple visuomotor driving tasks. As a side product, the pre-trained geometric modeling networks could bring further improvement to the depth and odometry estimation tasks. Extensive experiments covering a wide span of challenging scenarios have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed approach, where improvements range from 2\% to even over 100\% with very limited data.},

  abstract     = {Oversmoothing is a central challenge of building more powerful Graph Neural Networks ({GNN}s). While previous works have only demonstrated that oversmoothing is inevitable when the number of graph convolutions tends to infinity, in this paper, we precisely characterize the mechanism behind the phenomenon via a non-asymptotic analysis. Specifically, we distinguish between two different effects when applying graph convolutions---an undesirable mixing effect that homogenizes node representations in different classes, and a desirable denoising effect that homogenizes node representations in the same class. By quantifying these two effects on random graphs sampled from the Contextual Stochastic Block Model ({CSBM}), we show that oversmoothing happens once the mixing effect starts to dominate the denoising effect, and the number of layers required for this transition is $O(\log N/\log (\log N))$ for sufficiently dense graphs with $N$ nodes. We also extend our analysis to study the effects of Personalized {PageRank} ({PPR}), or equivalently, the effects of initial residual connections on oversmoothing. Our results suggest that while {PPR} mitigates oversmoothing at deeper layers, {PPR}-based architectures still achieve their best performance at a shallow depth and are outperformed by the graph convolution approach on certain graphs. Finally, we support our theoretical results with numerical experiments, which further suggest that the oversmoothing phenomenon observed in practice can be magnified by the difficulty of optimizing deep {GNN} models.},

Existing work adds $\ell_\infty$-bounded perturbations to the original sample so that the trained model generalizes poorly. Such perturbations, however, are easy to eliminate by adversarial training and data augmentations. In this paper, we resolve this problem from a novel perspective by perturbing only one pixel in each image. Interestingly, such a small modification could effectively degrade model accuracy to almost an untrained counterpart. Moreover, our produced One-Pixel Shortcut ({OPS}) could not be erased by adversarial training and strong augmentations. To generate {OPS}, we perturb in-class images at the same position to the same target value that could mostly and stably deviate from all the original images. Since such generation is only based on images, {OPS} needs significantly less computation cost than the previous methods using {DNN} generators. Based on {OPS}, we introduce an unlearnable dataset called {CIFAR}-10-{S}, which is indistinguishable from {CIFAR}-10 by humans but induces the trained model to extremely low accuracy. Even under adversarial training, a {ResNet}-18 trained on {CIFAR}-10-{S} has only 10.61\% accuracy, compared to 83.02\% by the existing error-minimizing method.},

However, current models in this regime mostly focus on improving testing performance of in-distribution data and largely ignores the potential risk w.r.t. out-of-distribution ({OOD}) testing samples that may cause negative outcome if the model is overconfident in prediction on them. In this paper, we identify a provably effective {OOD} discriminator based on an energy function directly extracted from a graph neural network trained with standard supervised classification loss. This paves a way for a simple and efficient {OOD} detection model for {GNN}-based semi-supervised learning on graphs, which we call {GNN}-{Safe}. It also has nice theoretical properties that guarantee an overall distinguishable margin between the detection scores for in-distribution and {OOD} samples, which, more critically, can be further strengthened by a non-learning-based structured propagation scheme. Extensive experiments over five real-world datasets validate the practical efficacy of the proposed model for detecting various {OOD} instances that are inter-connected in a graph with up to 17.0\% improvement on average {AUROC} over competitive peer models and without sacrificing in-distribution testing accuracy.},

In this work, we present a hyper label model that (once learned) infers the ground-truth labels for each dataset in a single forward pass without dataset-specific parameter learning. The hyper label model approximates an optimal analytical (yet computationally intractable) solution of the ground-truth labels. We train the model on synthetic data generated in the way that ensures the model approximates the analytical optimal solution, and build the model upon Graph Neural Network ({GNN}) to ensure the model prediction being invariant (or equivariant) to the permutation of {LF}s (or data points). On 14 real-world datasets, our hyper label model outperforms the best existing methods in both accuracy (by 1.4 points on average) and efficiency (by six times on average).

While recent object-centric models can successfully decompose a scene into objects, modeling their dynamics effectively still remains a challenge. We address this problem by introducing {SlotFormer} -- a {Transformer}-based autoregressive model operating on learned object-centric representations. Given a video clip, our approach reasons over object features to model spatio-temporal relationships and predicts accurate future object states. In this paper, we successfully apply {SlotFormer} to perform video prediction on datasets with complex object interactions. Moreover, the unsupervised {SlotFormer}'s dynamics model can be used to improve the performance on supervised downstream tasks, such as Visual Question Answering ({VQA}), and goal-conditioned planning. Besides, {SlotFormer} enables {VQA} models to reason about the future without object-level labels, even outperforming counterparts that use ground-truth annotations. Finally, we show its ability to serve as a world model for model-based planning, which is competitive with methods designed specifically for such tasks.},

This paper focuses on temporal variation modeling, which is the common key problem of extensive analysis tasks. Previous methods attempt to accomplish this directly from the 1{D} time series, which is extremely challenging due to the intricate temporal patterns. Based on the observation of multi-periodicity in time series, we ravel out the complex temporal variations into the multiple intraperiod- and interperiod-variations. To tackle the limitations of 1{D} time series in representation capability, we extend the analysis of temporal variations into the 2{D} space by transforming the 1{D} time series into a set of 2{D} tensors based on multiple periods. This transformation can embed the intraperiod- and interperiod-variations into the columns and rows of the 2{D} tensors respectively, making the 2{D}-variations to be easily modeled by 2{D} kernels. Based on this learnable process, we propose {TimesNet} as a task-general foundation model for time series analysis, where the 2{D} kernels are applied as backbone to capture the 2{D}-variations among the transformed 2{D} tensors. Since the 2{D} kernels are inherently parameter-shared across time series analysis tasks, {TimesNet} can be utilized as the unified model backbone across multiple time series analysis tasks. Extensive experiments and visualizations have been conducted with five mainstream time series analysis tasks to demonstrate the abilities of {TimesNet} as a general foundation model.},

An open challenge in simulating such systems is their multi-resolution dynamics: a small fraction of the system is extremely dynamic, and requires very fine-grained resolution, while a majority of the system is changing slowly and can be modeled by coarser spatial scales. Typical learning-based surrogate models use a uniform spatial scale, which needs to resolve to the finest required scale and can waste a huge compute to achieve required accuracy. In this work, we introduce Learning controllable Adaptive simulation for Multi-resolution Physics ({LAMP}) as the first full deep learning-based surrogate model that jointly learns the evolution model and optimizes appropriate spatial resolutions that devote more compute to the highly dynamic regions. We introduce learning techniques that optimizes {LAMP} with weighted sum of error and computational cost as objective, allowing {LAMP} to adapt to varying relative importance of error vs. computation tradeoff at inference time. We evaluate our method in a 1{D} benchmark of nonlinear {PDEs} and a challenging 2{D} mesh-based simulation. We demonstrate that our {LAMP} outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning surrogate models, and can adaptively trade-off computation to improve long-term prediction error: it achieves an average of 33.7\% error reduction for 1{D} nonlinear {PDEs}, and outperforms {MeshGraphNets} + classical Adaptive Mesh Refinement ({AMR}) in 2{D} mesh-based simulations.},

However, adversarial audio examples can cause abnormal behaviors for those acoustic systems, while being hard for humans to perceive. Various methods, such as transformation-based defenses and adversarial training, have been proposed to protect acoustic systems from adversarial attacks, but they are less effective against adaptive attacks. Furthermore, directly applying the methods from the image domain can lead to suboptimal results because of the unique properties of audio data. In this paper, we propose an adversarial purification-based defense pipeline, {AudioPure}, for acoustic systems via off-the-shelf diffusion models. Taking advantage of the strong generation ability of diffusion models, {AudioPure} first adds a small amount of noise to the adversarial audio and then runs the reverse sampling step to purify the noisy audio and recover clean audio. {AudioPure} is a plug-and-play method that can be directly applied to any pretrained classifier without any fine-tuning or re-training. We conduct extensive experiments on speech command recognition task to evaluate the robustness of {AudioPure}. Our method is effective against diverse adversarial attacks (e.g. $\mathcal{L}_2$ or $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-norm). It outperforms the existing methods under both strong adaptive white-box and black-box attacks bounded by $\mathcal{L}_2$ or $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-norm (up to +20\% in robust accuracy). Besides, we also evaluate the certified robustness for perturbations bounded by $\mathcal{L}_2$-norm via randomized smoothing. Our pipeline achieves a higher certified accuracy than baselines.},

Previous methods based on neural volume rendering mostly train a fully implicit model with {MLPs}, which typically require hours of training for a single scene. Recent efforts explore the explicit volumetric representation to accelerate the optimization via memorizing significant information with learnable voxel grids. However, existing voxel-based methods often struggle in reconstructing fine-grained geometry, even when combined with an {SDF}-based volume rendering scheme. We reveal that this is because 1) the voxel grids tend to break the color-geometry dependency that facilitates fine-geometry learning, and 2) the under-constrained voxel grids lack spatial coherence and are vulnerable to local minima. {Voxurf} addresses the aforementioned issues via several key designs, including 1) a two-stage training procedure that attains a coherent coarse shape and recovers fine details successively, 2) a dual color network that maintains color-geometry dependency, and 3) a hierarchical geometry feature to encourage information propagation across voxels. Extensive experiments show that {Voxurf} achieves high efficiency and high quality at the same time. On the {DTU} benchmark, {Voxurf} achieves higher reconstruction quality with a 20x training speedup compared to previous fully implicit methods.},

Previous research on diversity has mainly focused on promoting diversity to encourage exploration and thereby improve quality (the cumulative reward), maximizing diversity subject to quality constraints, or jointly maximizing quality and diversity, known as the quality-diversity problem. In this work, we present the quality-similar diversity problem that features diversity among policies of similar qualities. In contrast to task-agnostic diversity, we focus on task-specific diversity defined by a set of user-specified Behavior Descriptors ({BDs}). A {BD} is a scalar function of a trajectory (e.g., the fire action rate for an Atari game), which delivers the type of diversity the user prefers. To derive the gradient of the user-specified diversity with respect to a policy, which is not trivially available, we introduce a set of {BD} estimators and connect it with the classical policy gradient theorem. Based on the diversity gradient, we develop a population-based {RL} algorithm to adaptively and efficiently optimize the population diversity at multiple quality levels throughout training. Extensive results on {MuJoCo} and Atari demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms previous methods in terms of generating user-specified diverse policies across different quality levels.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised method, which is called Denoising Masked AutoEncoders ({DMAE}), for learning certified robust classifiers of images. In {DMAE}, we corrupt each image by adding Gaussian noises to each pixel value and randomly masking several patches. A Transformer-based encoder-decoder model is then trained to reconstruct the original image from the corrupted one. In this learning paradigm, the encoder will learn to capture relevant semantics for the downstream tasks, which is also robust to Gaussian additive noises. We show that the pre-trained encoder can naturally be used as the base classifier in Gaussian smoothed models, where we can analytically compute the certified radius for any data point. Although the proposed method is simple, it yields significant performance improvement in downstream classification tasks. We show that the {DMAE} {ViT}-Base model, which just uses 1/10 parameters of the model developed in recent work arXiv:2206.10550, achieves competitive or better certified accuracy in various settings. The {DMAE} {ViT}-Large model significantly surpasses all previous results, establishing a new state-of-the-art on {ImageNet} dataset. We further demonstrate that the pre-trained model has good transferability to the {CIFAR}-10 dataset, suggesting its wide adaptability.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge graphs ({KGs}) are powerful in terms of their inference abilities, but are also notorious for their incompleteness and long-tail distribution of relations. To address these challenges and expand the coverage of {KGs}, few-shot {KG} completion aims to make predictions for triplets involving novel relations when only a few training triplets are provided as reference. Previous methods have focused on designing local neighbor aggregators to learn entity-level information and/or imposing a potentially invalid sequential dependency assumption at the triplet level to learn meta relation information. However, pairwise triplet-level interactions and context-level relational information have been largely overlooked for learning meta representations of few-shot relations. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical relational learning method ({HiRe}) for few-shot {KG} completion. By jointly capturing three levels of relational information (entity-level, triplet-level and context-level), {HiRe} can effectively learn and refine meta representations of few-shot relations, and thus generalize well to new unseen relations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of {HiRe} over state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Real-world data generation often involves complex inter-dependencies among instances, violating the {IID}-data hypothesis of standard learning paradigms and posing a challenge for uncovering the geometric structures for learning desired instance representations. To this end, we introduce an energy constrained diffusion model which encodes a batch of instances from a dataset into evolutionary states that progressively incorporate other instances' information by their interactions. The diffusion process is constrained by descent criteria w.r.t. a principled energy function that characterizes the global consistency of instance representations over latent structures. We provide rigorous theory that implies closed-form optimal estimates for the pairwise diffusion strength among arbitrary instance pairs, which gives rise to a new class of neural encoders, dubbed as {DIFFormer} (diffusion-based Transformers), with two instantiations: a simple version with linear complexity for prohibitive instance numbers, and an advanced version for learning complex structures. Experiments highlight the wide applicability of our model as a general-purpose encoder backbone with superior performance in various tasks, such as node classification on large graphs, semi-supervised image/text classification, and spatial-temporal dynamics prediction.},

In recent years, deep learning models have become a prevailing approach to {NLI}, but they lack interpretability and explainability. In this work, we address the explainability of {NLI} by weakly supervised logical reasoning, and propose an Explainable Phrasal Reasoning ({EPR}) approach. Our model first detects phrases as the semantic unit and aligns corresponding phrases in the two sentences. Then, the model predicts the {NLI} label for the aligned phrases, and induces the sentence label by fuzzy logic formulas. Our {EPR} is almost everywhere differentiable and thus the system can be trained end-to-end in a weakly supervised manner. We annotated a corpus and developed a set of metrics to evaluate phrasal reasoning. Results show that our {EPR} yields much more meaningful explanations in terms of F scores than previous studies.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning methods nowadays rely on massive data, resulting in substantial costs of data storage and model training. Data selection is a useful tool to alleviate such costs, where a coreset of massive data is extracted to practically perform on par with full data. Based on carefully-designed score criteria, existing methods first count the score of each data point and then select the data points whose scores lie in a certain range to construct a coreset. These methods work well in their respective preconceived scenarios but are not robust to the change of scenarios, since the optimal range of scores varies as the scenario changes. The issue limits the application of these methods, because realistic scenarios often mismatch preconceived ones, and it is inconvenient or unfeasible to tune the criteria and methods accordingly. In this paper, to address the issue, a concept of the moderate coreset is discussed. Specifically, given any score criterion of data selection, different scenarios prefer data points with scores in different intervals. As the score median is a proxy of the score distribution in statistics, the data points with scores close to the score median can be seen as a proxy of full data and generalize different scenarios, which are used to construct the moderate coreset. As a proof-of-concept, a universal method that inherits the moderate coreset and uses the distance of a data point to its class center as the score criterion, is proposed to meet complex realistic scenarios. Extensive experiments confirm the advance of our method over prior state-of-the-art methods, leading to a strong baseline for future research.},

  abstract     = {While {GNN} explanation has recently received significant attention, existing works are consistently designed for static graphs. Due to the prevalence of temporal graphs, many temporal graph models have been proposed, but explaining their predictions remains to be explored. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose {T-GNNExplainer} for temporal graph model explanation. Specifically, we regard a temporal graph constituted by a sequence of temporal events. Given a target event, our task is to find a subset of previously occurred events that lead to the model's prediction for it. To handle this combinatorial optimization problem, {T-GNNExplainer} includes an explorer to find the event subsets with Monte Carlo Tree Search ({MCTS}) and a navigator that learns the correlations between events and helps reduce the search space. In particular, the navigator is trained in advance and then integrated with the explorer to speed up searching and achieve better results. To the best of our knowledge, {T-GNNExplainer} is the first explainer tailored for temporal graph models. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of {T-GNNExplainer}. Experimental results on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that {T-GNNExplainer} can achieve superior performance with up to about 50\% improvement in Area under Fidelity-Sparsity Curve.},

Counterfactual reasoning underpins discussions in fairness, the determination of blame and responsibility, credit assignment, and regret. In this paper, we study the evaluation of counterfactual statements through neural models. Specifically, we tackle two causal problems required to make such evaluations, i.e., counterfactual identification and estimation from an arbitrary combination of observational and experimental data. First, we show that neural causal models (NCMs) are expressive enough and encode the structural constraints necessary for performing counterfactual reasoning. Second, we develop an algorithm for simultaneously identifying and estimating counterfactual distributions. We show that this algorithm is sound and complete for deciding counterfactual identification in general settings. Third, considering the practical implications of these results, we introduce a new strategy for modeling NCMs using generative adversarial networks. Simulations corroborate with the proposed methodology.},

Compared to their CNN counterpart, Transformer models are hungry for large-scale data and their training schedules are usually prolonged. This sets great restrictions on training Transformers with limited resources, where a proper trade-off between training cost and model performance is longed. In this paper, we address the problem by proposing a framework that enables the training process under any training budget from the perspective of model structure, while achieving competitive model performance. Specifically, based on the observation that Transformer exhibits different levels of model redundancies at different training stages, we propose to dynamically control the activation rate of the model structure along the training process and meet the demand on the training budget by adjusting the duration on each level.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed the prosperity of pre-training graph neural networks (GNNs) for molecules. Typically, atom types as node attributes are randomly masked and GNNs are then trained to predict masked types as in AttrMask, following the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) task of BERT. However, unlike MLM where the vocabulary is large, the AttrMask pre-training does not learn informative molecular representations due to small and unbalanced atom 'vocabulary'. To amend this problem, we propose a variant of VQ-VAE as a context-aware tokenizer to encode atom attributes into chemically meaningful discrete codes. This can enlarge the atom vocabulary size and mitigate the quantitative divergence between dominant (e.g., carbons) and rare atoms (e.g., phosphorus). With the enlarged atom 'vocabulary', we propose a novel node-level pre-training task, dubbed Masked Atoms Modeling (MAM), to mask some discrete codes randomly and then pre-train GNNs to predict them. MAM also mitigates another issue of AttrMask, namely the negative transfer. It can be easily combined with various pre-training tasks to improve their performance. Furthermore, we propose triplet masked contrastive learning (TMCL) for graph-level pre-training to model the heterogeneous semantic similarity between molecules for effective molecule retrieval. MAM and TMCL constitute a novel pre-training framework, Mole-BERT, which can match or outperform state-of-the-art methods in a fully data-driven manner.},

Binary neural network (BNN), one of the most promising model compression methods, can dramatically reduce the computations and parameters of full-precision convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, there are different properties between BNN and full-precision CNN, and we can hardly use the experience of designing CNN to develop BNN. In this study, we reconsider components in binary convolution, such as residual connection, BatchNorm, activation function, and structure, for IR tasks. We conduct systematic analyses to explain each component's role in binary convolution and discuss the pitfalls. Specifically, we find that residual connection can reduce the information loss caused by binarization; BatchNorm can solve the value range gap between residual connection and binary convolution; The position of the activation function dramatically affects the performance of BNN. Based on our findings and analyses, we design a simple yet efficient basic binary convolution unit (BBCU). Furthermore, we divide IR networks into four parts and specially design variants of BBCU for each part to explore the benefit of binarizing these parts. We conduct experiments on different IR tasks, and our BBCU significantly outperforms other BNNs and lightweight models, which shows that BBCU can serve as a basic unit for binarized IR networks.},

  abstract     = {Blind image super-resolution (Blind-SR) aims to recover a high-resolution (HR) image from its corresponding low-resolution (LR) input image with unknown degradations. Most of the existing works design an explicit degradation estimator for each degradation to guide SR. However, it is infeasible to provide concrete labels of multiple degradation combinations (e.g., blur, noise, jpeg compression) to supervise the degradation estimator training. In addition, these special designs for certain degradation, such as blur, impedes the models from being generalized to handle different degradations. To this end, it is necessary to design an implicit degradation estimator that can extract discriminative degradation representation for all degradations without relying on the supervision of degradation ground-truth. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge Distillation based Blind-SR network (KDSR). It consists of a knowledge distillation based implicit degradation estimator network (KD-IDE) and an efficient SR network. To learn the KDSR model, we first train a teacher network: KD-IDE$_{T}$. It takes paired HR and LR patches as inputs and is optimized with the SR network jointly. Then, we further train a student network KD-IDE$_{S}$, which only takes LR images as input and learns to extract the same implicit degradation representation (IDR) as KD-IDE$_{T}$. In addition, to fully use extracted IDR, we design a simple, strong, and efficient IDR based dynamic convolution residual block (IDR-DCRB) to build an SR network. We conduct extensive experiments under classic and real-world degradation settings. The results show that KDSR achieves SOTA performance and can generalize to various degradation processes.},

Previous research in robotic fluid manipulation mostly consider fluids governed by an ideal, Newtonian model in simple task settings (e.g., pouring). However, the vast majority of real-world fluid systems manifest their complexities in terms of the fluid's complex material behaviors and multi-component interactions, both of which were well beyond the scope of the current literature. To evaluate robot learning algorithms on understanding and interacting with such complex fluid systems, a comprehensive virtual platform with versatile simulation capabilities and well-established tasks is needed. In this work, we introduce FluidLab, a simulation environment with a diverse set of manipulation tasks involving complex fluid dynamics. These tasks address interactions between solid and fluid as well as among multiple fluids. At the heart of our platform is a fully differentiable physics simulator, FluidEngine, providing GPU-accelerated simulations and gradient calculations for various material types and their couplings, extending the scope of the existing differentiable simulation engines. We identify several challenges for fluid manipulation learning by evaluating a set of reinforcement learning and trajectory optimization methods on our platform. To address these challenges, we propose several domain-specific optimization schemes coupled with differentiable physics, which are empirically shown to be effective in tackling optimization problems featured by fluid system's non-convex and non-smooth properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate reasonable sim-to-real transfer by deploying optimized trajectories in real-world settings.},

Most existing methods process WSIs by extracting and aggregating local patch features, ignoring the global morphological and spatial information.

ILRA highlights the importance of instance correlation modeling but refrains from directly using the transformer encoder considering the O(n2) complexity. We design a novel attention mechanism to model the correlations between instances. Our approach utilizes a low-rank constraint to approximate the instance correlation matrix, reducing the computational complexity from O(n2) to O(n). We conduct extensive experiments on three public WSI datasets (CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC, and PANDA) for both binary and multi-class classification tasks. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while being computationally efficient. On CAMELYON16, our method achieves 96.49% AUC with only 512 instances per bag. On TCGA-NSCLC, our method achieves 97.63% AUC. On PANDA, our method achieves 0.6562 kappa score.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning video compression outperforms its hand-craft counterparts with enhanced flexibility and capacity. One key component of the learned video codec is the autoregressive entropy model conditioned on spatial and temporal priors. Operating autoregressive on raster scanning order naively treats the context as unidirectional. This is neither efficient nor optimal, considering that conditional information probably locates at the end of the sequence. We thus introduce an entropy model based on a masked image modeling transformer (MIMT) to learn the spatial-temporal dependencies. Video frames are first encoded into sequences of tokens and then processed with the transformer encoder as priors. The transformer decoder learns the probability mass functions (PMFs) conditioned on the priors and masked inputs. Then it is capable of selecting optimal decoding orders without a fixed direction. During training, MIMT aims to predict the PMFs of randomly masked tokens by attending to tokens in all directions. This allows MIMT to capture the temporal dependencies from encoded priors and the spatial dependencies from the unmasked tokens, i.e., decoded tokens. At inference time, the model begins with generating PMFs of all masked tokens in parallel and then decodes the frame iteratively from the previously-selected decoded tokens (i.e., with high confidence). In addition, we improve the overall performance with more techniques, e.g., manifold conditional priors accumulating a long range of information, shifted window attention to reduce complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed MIMT framework equipped with the new transformer entropy model achieves state-of-the-art performance on HEVC, UVG, and MCL-JCV datasets, generally outperforming the VVC in terms of PSNR and SSIM.},

Thus, there is great interest in denoising MRI scans, especially for the subtype of diffusion MRI scans that are severely SNR-limited. While most prior MRI denoising methods are supervised in nature, acquiring supervised training datasets for the multitude of anatomies, MRI scanners, and scan parameters proves impractical. Here, we propose Denoising Diffusion Models for Denoising Diffusion MRI (DDM²), a self-supervised denoising method for MRI denoising using diffusion denoising generative models. Our three-stage framework integrates statistic-based denoising theory into diffusion models and performs denoising through conditional generation. During inference, we represent input noisy measurements as a sample from an intermediate posterior distribution within the diffusion Markov chain. We conduct experiments on 4 real-world in-vivo diffusion MRI datasets and show that our DDM² demonstrates superior denoising performances ascertained with clinically-relevant visual qualitative and quantitative metrics.},

The proposal of $\beta$-VAEs breaks this interpretation and generalizes VAEs to application domains beyond generative modeling (e.g., representation learning, clustering, or lossy data compression) by introducing an objective function that allows practitioners to trade off between the information content ("bit rate") of the latent representation and the distortion of reconstructed data. In this paper, we reconsider this rate/distortion trade-off in the context of hierarchical VAEs, i.e., VAEs with more than one layer of latent variables.

Recently, neural operators have shown the ability to solve {PDEs} by learning the integral kernel directly in {Fourier}/{Wavelet} space, so the difficulty of solving the coupled {PDEs} depends on dealing with the coupled mappings between the functions. The paper proposes a coupled multiwavelets neural operator ({CMWNO}) learning scheme that decouples integral kernels during multiwavelet decomposition and reconstruction, achieving 2X--4X improvement in relative L2 error compared to the best results from the state-of-the-art models on problems like {Gray-Scott} equations and non-local mean field game problems.},

However, due to the complexity that the notion of time introduces to the learning of the rules, an accurate graph reasoning, e.g., predicting new links between entities, is still a difficult problem. In this paper, we propose TILP, a differentiable framework for temporal logical rules learning. By designing a constrained random walk mechanism and the introduction of temporal operators, we ensure the efficiency of our model. We present temporal features modeling in tKG, e.g., recurrence, temporal order, interval between pair of relations, and duration, and incorporate it into our learning process. We compare TILP with state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets. We show that our proposed framework can improve upon the performance of baseline methods while providing interpretable results. In particular, we consider various scenarios in which training samples are limited, data is biased, and the time range between training and inference are different. In all these cases, TILP works much better than the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Most offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods suffer from the trade-off between improving the policy to surpass the behavior policy and constraining the policy to limit the deviation from the behavior policy as computing $Q$-values using out-of-distribution (OOD) actions will suffer from errors due to distributional shift. The recently proposed \textit{In-sample Learning} paradigm (i.e., IQL), which improves the policy by quantile regression using only data samples, shows great promise because it learns an optimal policy without querying the value function of any unseen actions. However, it remains unclear how this type of method handles the distributional shift in learning the value function. In this work, we make a key finding that the in-sample learning paradigm arises under the \textit{Implicit Value Regularization} (IVR) framework. This gives a deeper understanding of why the in-sample learning paradigm works, i.e., it applies implicit value regularization to the policy. Based on the IVR framework, we further propose two practical algorithms, Sparse $Q$-learning (SQL) and Exponential $Q$-learning (EQL), which adopt the same value regularization used in existing works, but in a complete in-sample manner. Compared with IQL, we find that our algorithms introduce sparsity in learning the value function, making them more robust in noisy data regimes. We also verify the effectiveness of SQL and EQL on D4RL benchmark datasets and show the benefits of in-sample learning by comparing them with CQL in small data regimes.},

Besides, existing works have shown that ICL also suffers from various biases and requires delicate calibration treatment. To address both challenges, we advocate a simple and effective solution, $k$NN Prompting, which first queries LLM with training data for distributed representations, then predicts test instances by simply referring to nearest neighbors. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate its two-fold superiority: 1) Calibration-Free: $k$NN Prompting does not directly align LLM output distribution with task-specific label space, instead leverages such distribution to align test and training instances. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art calibration-based methods under comparable few-shot scenario. 2) Beyond-Context: $k$NN Prompting can further scale up effectively with as many training data as are available, continually bringing substantial improvements. The scaling trend holds across 10 orders of magnitude ranging from 2 shots to 1024 shots as well as different LLMs scales ranging from 0.8B to 30B. It successfully bridges data scaling into model scaling, and brings new potentials for the gradient-free paradigm of LLM deployment.},

Recently, model-based RL algorithms have greatly improved sample-efficiency by concurrently learning an internal model of the world, and supplementing real environment interactions with imagined rollouts for policy improvement. However, learning an effective model of the world from scratch is challenging, and in stark contrast to humans that rely heavily on world understanding and visual cues for learning new skills. In this work, we investigate whether internal models learned by modern model-based RL algorithms can be leveraged to solve new, distinctly different tasks faster. We propose Model-Based Cross-Task Transfer (XTRA), a framework for sample-efficient online RL with scalable pretraining and finetuning of learned world models. By offline multi-task pretraining and online cross-task finetuning, we achieve substantial improvements over a baseline trained from scratch; we improve mean performance of model-based algorithm EfficientZero by 23%, and by as much as 71% in some instances.},

The goal in both cases is to recover the treatment effect without having an access to a hidden confounder. This objective is attained by first estimating the conditional mean of the desired outcome variable given relevant covariates (the 'first stage' regression), and then taking the (conditional) expectation of this function as a 'second stage' procedure. We propose to compute these conditional expectations directly using a regression function to the learned input features of the first stage, thus avoiding the need for sampling or density estimation. All functions and features (and in particular, the output features in the second stage) are neural networks learned adaptively from data, with the sole requirement that the final layer of the first stage should be linear. The proposed method is shown to converge to the true causal parameter, and outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods on challenging causal benchmarks, including settings involving high-dimensional image data.},

Our theoretical analysis shows that our adversarial variational Bayesian framework finds the optimal domain index at equilibrium.

While NODEs model the evolution of a latent variables as the solution to an ODE, C-NODE models the evolution of the latent variables as the solution of a family of first-order quasi-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) along curves on which the PDEs reduce to ODEs, referred to as characteristic curves. This in turn allows the application of the standard frameworks for solving ODEs, namely the adjoint method. Learning optimal characteristic curves for given tasks improves the performance and computational efficiency, compared to state of the art NODE models. We prove that the C-NODE framework extends the classical NODE on classification tasks by demonstrating explicit C-NODE representable functions not expressible by NODEs. Additionally, we present C-NODE-based continuous normalizing flows, which describe the density evolution of latent variables along multiple dimensions. Empirical results demonstrate the improvements provided by the proposed method for classification and density estimation on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and MNIST datasets under a similar computational budget as the existing NODE methods. The results also provide empirical evidence that the learned curves improve the efficiency of the system through a lower number of parameters and function evaluations compared with baselines.},

Since most summarization datasets do not come with gold labels indicating whether document sentences are summary-worthy, different labeling algorithms have been proposed to extrapolate oracle extracts for model training. In this work, we identify two flaws with the widely used greedy labeling approach: it delivers suboptimal and deterministic oracles. To alleviate both issues, we propose a simple yet effective labeling algorithm that creates soft, expectation-based sentence labels. We define a new learning objective for extractive summarization which incorporates learning signals from multiple oracle summaries and prove it is equivalent to estimating the oracle expectation for each document sentence. Without any architectural modifications, the proposed labeling scheme achieves superior performance on a variety of summarization benchmarks across domains and languages, in both supervised and zero-shot settings.},

  abstract     = {Decision Transformers (DT) have demonstrated strong performances in offline reinforcement learning settings, but quickly adapting to unseen novel tasks remains challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework, called Hyper-Decision Transformer (HDT), that can generalize to novel tasks from a handful of demonstrations in a data- and parameter-efficient manner. To achieve such a goal, we propose to augment the base DT with an adaptation module, whose parameters are initialized by a hyper-network. When encountering unseen tasks, the hyper-network takes a handful of demonstrations as inputs and initializes the adaptation module accordingly. This initialization enables HDT to efficiently adapt to novel tasks by only fine-tuning the adaptation module. We validate HDT's generalization capability on object manipulation tasks. We find that with a single expert demonstration and fine-tuning only 0.5% of DT parameters, HDT adapts faster to unseen tasks than fine-tuning the entire model.},

  abstract     = {The robustness of a deep classifier can be characterized by its margins: the decision boundary's distances to natural data points. However, it is unclear whether existing robust training methods effectively increase the margin for each vulnerable point during training. To understand this, we propose a continuous-time framework for quantifying the relative speed of the decision boundary with respect to each individual point. Through visualizing the moving speed of the decision boundary under Adversarial Training, one of the most effective robust training algorithms, a surprising moving-behavior is revealed: the decision boundary moves away from some vulnerable points but simultaneously moves closer to others, decreasing their margins. To alleviate these conflicting dynamics of the decision boundary, we propose Dynamics-aware Robust Training (DyART), which encourages the decision boundary to engage in movement that prioritizes increasing smaller margins. In contrast to prior works, DyART directly operates on the margins rather than their indirect approximations, allowing for more targeted and effective robustness improvement. Experiments on the CIFAR-10 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets verify that DyART alleviates the conflicting dynamics of the decision boundary and obtains improved robustness under various perturbation sizes compared to the state-of-the-art defenses.},

One such approach in deep neural networks based tasks is employing a shared feature representation and learning a customized classifier head for each client. However, previous works do not utilize the global knowledge during local representation learning and also neglect the fine-grained collaboration between local classifier heads, which limit the model generalization ability. In this work, we conduct explicit local-global feature alignment by leveraging global semantic knowledge for learning a better representation. Moreover, we quantify the benefit of classifier combination for each client as a function of the combining weights and derive an optimization problem for estimating optimal weights. Finally, extensive evaluation results on benchmark datasets with various heterogeneous data scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

Despite already providing impressive empirical results, these diffusion models algorithms can be further improved by reducing the variance of the training targets in their denoising score-matching objective. We argue that the source of such variance lies in the handling of intermediate noise-variance scales, where multiple modes in the data affect the direction of reverse paths. We propose to remedy the problem by incorporating a reference batch which we use to calculate weighted conditional scores as more stable training targets. We show that the procedure indeed helps in the challenging intermediate regime by reducing the covariance of training targets. The new stable targets can be seen as trading bias for reduced variance, where the bias vanishes with increasing reference batch size. Empirically, models trained with our method generate higher quality samples and converge faster, and our objective achieves new state-of-the-art likelihood results on CIFAR-10.},

  abstract     = {Estimating the performance of a machine learning system is a longstanding challenge in artificial intelligence research. Today, this challenge is especially relevant given the emergence of systems which appear to increasingly outperform human beings. In some cases, this superhuman performance is readily demonstrated; for example by defeating legendary human players in traditional two player games. On the other hand, it can be challenging to evaluate classification models that potentially surpass human performance. Indeed, human annotations are often treated as a ground truth, which implicitly assumes the superiority of the human over any models trained on human annotations. In reality, human annotators can make mistakes and be subjective. Evaluating the performance with respect to a genuine oracle may be more objective and reliable, even when querying the oracle is expensive or impossible. In this paper, we first raise the challenge of evaluating the performance of both humans and models with respect to an oracle which is unobserved. We develop a theory for estimating the accuracy compared to the oracle, using only imperfect human annotations for reference. Our analysis provides a simple recipe for detecting and certifying superhuman performance in this setting, which we believe will assist in understanding the stage of current research on classification. We validate the convergence of the bounds and the assumptions of our theory on carefully designed toy experiments with known oracles. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our theory by meta-analyzing large-scale natural language processing tasks, for which an oracle does not exist, and show that under our assumptions a number of models from recent years are with high probability superhuman.},

While some prior works have applied such image GANs to unconditional 2D portrait video generation and static 3D portrait synthesis, there are few works successfully extending GANs for generating 3D-aware portrait videos. In this work, we propose PV3D, the first generative framework that can synthesize multi-view consistent portrait videos. The method extends the recent static 3D-aware image GAN to the video domain by generalizing the 3D implicit neural representation to model the spatio-temporal space. To introduce motion dynamics to the generation process, we develop a motion generator by stacking multiple motion layers to generate motion features via modulated convolution. To alleviate motion ambiguities caused by camera/human motions, we propose a simple yet effective camera condition strategy for PV3D, enabling both temporal and multi-view consistent video generation. We introduce two discriminators for regularizing the spatial and temporal domains to ensure the plausibility of the generated portrait videos. These elaborated designs enable PV3D to generate 3D-aware motion-plausible portrait videos with high-quality appearance and geometry, significantly outperforming prior works. As a result, PV3D is able to support many downstream applications such as animating static portraits and view-consistent video motion editing.},

  abstract     = {Long-term engagement is preferred over immediate engagement in sequential recommendation as it directly affects product operational metrics such as daily active users (DAUs) and dwell time. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) is widely regarded as a promising framework for optimizing long-term engagement in sequential recommendation. However, due to expensive online interactions, it is very difficult for RL algorithms to perform state-action value estimation, exploration and feature extraction when optimizing long-term engagement. In this paper, we propose ResAct which seeks a policy that is close to, but better than, the online-serving policy. In this way, we can collect sufficient data near the learned policy so that state-action values can be properly estimated, and there is no need to perform online exploration. ResAct optimizes the policy by first reconstructing the online behaviors and then improving it via a Residual Actor. To extract long-term information, ResAct utilizes two information-theoretical regularizers to confirm the expressiveness and conciseness of features. We conduct experiments on a benchmark dataset and a large-scale industrial dataset which consists of tens of millions of recommendation requests. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in various long-term engagement optimization tasks.},

In contrast to the empirical success reported in prior works, the working mechanism of crossmodal KD remains a mystery. In this paper, we present a thorough understanding of crossmodal KD. We begin with two case studies and demonstrate that KD is not a universal cure in crossmodal knowledge transfer. We then present the modality Venn diagram to understand modality relationships and the modality focusing hypothesis revealing the decisive factor in the efficacy of crossmodal KD. Experimental results on 6 multimodal datasets help justify our hypothesis, diagnose failure cases, and point directions to improve crossmodal knowledge transfer in the future.},

Assuming optimal, the teacher policy has the perfect timing and capability to intervene in the learning process of the student agent, providing safety guarantee and exploration guidance. Nevertheless, in many real-world settings it is expensive or even impossible to obtain a well-performing teacher policy. In this work, we relax the assumption of a well-performing teacher and develop a new method that can incorporate arbitrary teacher policies with modest or inferior performance. We instantiate an Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, termed Teacher-Student Shared Control (TS2C), which incorporates teacher intervention based on trajectory-based value estimation. Theoretical analysis validates that the proposed TS2C algorithm attains efficient exploration and substantial safety guarantee without being affected by the teacher's own performance. Experiments on various continuous control tasks show that our method can exploit teacher policies at different performance levels while maintaining a low training cost. Moreover, the student policy surpasses the imperfect teacher policy in terms of higher accumulated reward in held-out testing environments.},

In light of the well-learned visual features, some existing works transfer image representation to video domain and achieve good results. However, how to utilize image-language pre-trained model (e.g., CLIP) for video-language pre-training (post-pretraining) is still under explored. In this paper, we investigate two questions: 1) what are the factors hindering post-pretraining CLIP to further improve the performance on video-language tasks? and 2) how to mitigate the impact of these factors? Through a series of comparative experiments and analyses, we find that the data scale and domain gap between language sources have great impacts. Motivated by these, we propose a Omnisource Cross-modal Learning method equipped with a Video Proxy mechanism on the basis of CLIP, namely CLIP-ViP. Extensive results show that our approach improves the performance of CLIP on video-text retrieval by a large margin. Our model also achieves SOTA results on a variety of datasets, including MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and ActivityNet.},

  abstract     = {Adversarial attack aims to generate deceptive inputs to fool a machine learning model. In deep learning, an adversarial input created for a specific neural network can also trick other neural networks. This intriguing property is known as black-box transferability of adversarial examples. To improve black-box transferability, a previously proposed method called Intermediate Level Attack ({ILA}) fine-tunes an adversarial example by maximizing its perturbation on an intermediate layer of the source model. Meanwhile, it has been shown that simple image transformations can also enhance attack transferability. Based on these two observations, we propose {ILA-DA}, which employs three novel augmentation techniques to enhance {ILA}. Specifically, we propose (1) an automated way to apply effective image transformations, (2) an efficient reverse adversarial update technique, and (3) an attack interpolation method to create more transferable adversarial examples. Shown by extensive experiments, {ILA-DA} greatly outperforms {ILA} and other state-of-the-art attacks by a large margin. On {ImageNet}, we attain an average attack success rate of 84.5\%, which is 19.5\% better than {ILA} and 4.7\% better than the previous state-of-the-art across nine undefended models. For defended models, {ILA-DA} also leads existing attacks and provides further gains when incorporated into more advanced attack methods.},

In this paper, we consider a more realistic {PLL} scenario with competitive label noise that is more difficult to distinguish from the true label than the random label noise. We propose a novel Mutual Learning based {PLL} approach named {ML-PLL} to address this challenging problem. {ML-PLL} learns a prediction network based classifier and a class-prototype based classifier cooperatively through interactive mutual learning and label correction. Moreover, we use a transformation network to model the association relationships between the true label and candidate labels, and learn it together with the prediction network to match the observed candidate labels in the training data and enhance label correction. Extensive experiments are conducted on several benchmark {PLL} datasets, and the proposed {ML-PLL} approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for partial label learning.},

However, this assumption does not hold in many real-world scenarios where the training and test data come from different distributions. In this paper, we formalize this learning scenario as a new problem called partial label unsupervised domain adaptation ({PLUDA}). To address this challenging {PLUDA} problem, we propose a novel Prototype Alignment based {PLUDA} method named {PAPLUDA}, which dynamically refines the pseudo-labels of instances from both the source and target domains by consulting the outputs of a teacher-student model in a moving-average manner, and bridges the cross-domain discrepancy through inter-domain class-prototype alignment. In addition, a teacher-student model based contrastive regularization is deployed to enhance prediction stability and hence improve the class-prototypes in both domains for {PLUDA}. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that {PAPLUDA} achieves state-of-the-art performance on the widely used benchmark datasets.},

Specifically, {CLNN} models temporal relations between events using conditional intensity rates informed by a set of {wCL} formulas, which are more expressive than related prior work. Unlike conventional approaches of searching for generative rules through expensive combinatorial optimization, we design smooth activation functions for components of {wCL} formulas that enable a continuous relaxation of the discrete search space and efficient learning of {wCL} formulas using gradient-based methods. Experiments on synthetic datasets manifest our model's ability to recover the ground-truth rules and improve computational efficiency. In addition, experiments on real-world datasets show that our models perform competitively when compared with state-of-the-art models.},

Due to its desirable theoretical properties, path integration is a widely used scheme for feature attribution to interpret model predictions. However, the methods implementing this scheme currently rely on absolute attribution scores to eventually provide sensible interpretations. This not only contradicts the premise that the features with larger attribution scores are more relevant to the model prediction, but also conflicts with the theoretical settings for which the desirable properties of the attributions are proven. We address this by devising a method to first compute an appropriate reference for the path integration scheme. This reference further helps in identifying valid interpolation points on a desired integration path.

  abstract     = {Learning to Optimize ({L2O}) has drawn increasing attention as it often remarkably accelerates the optimization procedure of complex tasks by ``overfitting'' specific task type, leading to enhanced performance compared to analytical optimizers. Generally, {L2O} develops a parameterized optimization method (i.e., ``optimizer'') by learning from solving sample problems. This data-driven procedure yields {L2O} that can efficiently solve problems similar to those seen in training, that is, drawn from the same ``task distribution''. However, such learned optimizers often struggle when new test problems come with a substantial deviation from the training task distribution. This paper investigates a potential solution to this open challenge, by meta-training an {L2O} optimizer that can perform fast test-time self-adaptation to an out-of-distribution task, in only a few steps. We theoretically characterize the generalization of {L2O}, and further show that our proposed framework (termed as {M-L2O}) provably facilitates rapid task adaptation by locating well-adapted initial points for the optimizer weight. Empirical observations on several classic tasks like {LASSO} and Quadratic, demonstrate that {M-L2O} converges significantly faster than vanilla {L2O} with only 5 steps of adaptation, echoing our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Graph data (such as scene graphs and knowledge graphs) are usually incomplete in real-world applications, requiring graph reasoning models for missing-fact or missing-relationship inference. While these models can achieve state-of-the-art performance, they require large amounts of training data. Recent interest has grown in label creation with data programming ({DP}) methods, which generate training labels from heuristic labeling functions. However, existing methods typically focus on unstructured data and are not optimized for graphs. We propose {LogicDP}, a data programming framework for graph data. {LogicDP} differs from existing {DP} methods in two key ways: (1) it utilizes the inductive logic programming ({ILP}) technique and automatically discovers labeling functions from graph data; (2) it employs a budget-aware framework to iteratively refine functions by querying an oracle, significantly reducing human effort in function creation. Experiments demonstrate that {LogicDP} achieves better data efficiency in both scene graph and knowledge graph reasoning tasks.},

  abstract     = {Estimating {3D} human pose and shape from monocular videos requires directly recovering pixel-alignment {3D} human pose and body shape from monocular images or videos, which is challenging due to its inherent ambiguity. To improve precision, existing methods highly rely on the initialized mean pose and shape as prior estimates and parameter regression with an iterative error feedback manner. In addition, video-based approaches model the overall change over the image-level features to temporally enhance the single-frame feature, but fail to capture the rotational motion at the joint level, and cannot guarantee local temporal consistency. To address these issues, we propose a novel {Transformer}-based model with a design of independent tokens. We introduce three types of tokens independent of the image feature: joint rotation tokens, shape token, and camera token. The paper introduces an innovative approach using independent tokens in a {Transformer} architecture to better capture joint-level motion for {3D} human pose and shape estimation from monocular video input.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops an interior-point approach to solve constrained variational inequality (cVI) problems. Inspired by the efficacy of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method in the single-objective context, we generalize ADMM to derive a first-order method for cVIs, that we refer to as ADMM-based interior-point method for constrained VIs (ACVI). We provide convergence guarantees for ACVI in two general classes of problems: (i) when the operator is ξ-monotone, and (ii) when it is monotone, some constraints are active and the game is not purely rotational. When the operator is, in addition, L-Lipschitz for the latter case, we match known lower bounds on rates for the gap function of O(1/√K) and O(1/K) for the last and average iterate, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first presentation of a first-order interior-point method for the general cVI problem that has a global convergence guarantee. Unlike previous work in this setting, ACVI provides a means to solve cVIs when the constraints are nontrivial. Empirical analyses demonstrate clear advantages of ACVI over common first-order methods. In particular, (i) cyclical behavior is notably reduced as our methods approach the solution from the analytic center, and (ii) unlike projection-based methods that zigzag when near a constraint, ACVI efficiently handles the constraints.},

Hence, training DNNs to be certifiably robust to these perturbations is critical. However, no prior work has been able to incorporate the objective of deterministic certified robustness against geometric transformations into the training procedure, as existing verifiers are exceedingly slow. To address these challenges, we propose the first provable defense for deterministic certified geometric robustness. Our framework leverages a novel GPU-optimized verifier that can certify images between 60× to 42,600× faster than existing geometric robustness verifiers, and thus unlike existing works, is fast enough for use in training. Across multiple datasets, our results show that networks trained via our framework consistently achieve state-of-the-art deterministic certified geometric robustness and clean accuracy. Furthermore, for the first time, we verify the geometric robustness of a neural network for the challenging, real-world setting of autonomous driving.},

To tackle this, unsupervised domain generalization (UDG) is proposed, which requires the model to be trained on several different domains without supervision and generalize well on unseen test domains. We propose a cycle cross-domain reconstruction task for unsupervised domain generalization in the absence of paired images. The cycle cross-domain reconstruction task converts a masked image from one domain to another domain and then reconstructs the original image from the converted images. To preserve the divergent domain knowledge of decoders in the cycle reconstruction task, we propose a novel domain-contrastive loss to regularize the domain information in reconstructed images encoded with the desirable domain style. Experimental results show our method improves state-of-the-art unsupervised domain generalization methods by average +5.59%, +4.52%, +4.22%, +7.02% on 1%, 5%, 10%, 100% PACS, and +5.08%, +6.49%, +1.79%, +0.53% on 1%, 5%, 10%, 100% DomainNet, respectively.},

First, the sum of the regrets of the two players, though not necessarily non-negative as in normal-form games, is approximately non-negative in Markov games. This property allows us to bound the second-order path lengths of the learning dynamics. Second, we prove a tighter algebraic inequality regarding the weights deployed by OFTRL that shaves an extra $\log T$ factor. This crucial improvement enables the inductive analysis that leads to the final $O(T^{-1})$ rate.},

To mitigate such bias, we propose a new method named BETA, which incorporates knowledge distillation and noisy label learning into one coherent framework. This is enabled by a new divide-to-adapt strategy where BETA divides the target domain into an easy-to-adapt subdomain with less noise and a hard-to-adapt subdomain. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that BETA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DABP methods on several benchmarks.},

Thanks to the mobile convolution that effectively exchanges local information between pixels (and thus cross-windows), MOAT does not need the extra window-shifting mechanism. The tiny-MOAT family, obtained by simply reducing the channel sizes, also surprisingly outperforms several mobile-specific transformer-based models on ImageNet. MOAT achieves 89.1% / 81.5% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K / ImageNet-1K-V2 with ImageNet22K pretraining, and 59.2% box AP on COCO object detection with 227M model parameters.},

Theoretically, we show that DoC yields policies that are consistent with their conditioning inputs, ensuring that conditioning a learned policy on a desired high-return future outcome will correctly induce high-return behavior. Empirically, we demonstrate that DoC achieves significantly better performance than Decision Transformer on environments with highly stochastic rewards and transitions.},

DBQ can be embedded into some state-of-the-art 3D detectors and trained in an end-to-end manner, which significantly reduces the computational cost. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce latency by 30%-100% on KITTI, Waymo, and ONCE datasets. Due to skipping the redundant points, some evaluation metrics show significant improvements. For example, the inference speed of our detector can reach 162 FPS on KITTI scene, and 30 FPS on Waymo and ONCE scenes without performance degradation.},

By optimizing a single task, catastrophic forgetting can be prevented theoretically. While optimizing multi-tasks, the trade-off between integrating knowledge from the new task and retaining previous knowledge of the old task can be achieved by assigning appropriate weights to corresponding tasks in compliance with the objectives. Experimental results confirm that the various theoretical conclusions are robust to a wide range of data distributions, and several applications on synthetic and real data show that the proposed method while being computationally efficient, achieves comparable results.},

Existing models are mostly trained on other patients data and evaluated on new patients. Many of them might suffer from poor generalizability. One key reason can be overfitting due to the unique information related to patient identities and their data collection environments, referred to as patient covariates in the paper. These patient covariates usually do not contribute to predicting the targets but are often difficult to remove. As a result, they can bias the model training process and impede generalization. In this paper, considering the diversity of patient covariates, we propose a new setting by treating each patient as a separate domain (leading to many domains). We propose {ManyDG}, that can scale to such many-domain problems. Our method identifies the patient domain covariates by mutual reconstruction and removes them via an orthogonal projection step. Extensive experiments show that {ManyDG} can boost the generalization performance on multiple real-world healthcare tasks (e.g., 3.7\% {J}accard improvements on {MIMIC} drug recommendation) and support realistic but challenging settings such as insufficient data and continuous learning.},

This paper pinpoints the major source of {GNN}s' performance gain to their intrinsic generalization capability, by introducing an intermediate model class dubbed as P(ropagational){MLP}, which is identical to standard {MLP} in training, but then adopts {GNN}'s architecture in testing. As an initial step to analyze {PMLP}, we show its essential difference to {MLP} at infinite-width limit lies in the {NTK} feature map in the post-training stage. Moreover, through extrapolation analysis (i.e., generalization under distribution shifts), we find that though most {GNN}s and their {PMLP} counterparts cannot extrapolate non-linear functions for extreme out-of-distribution data, they have greater potential to generalize to testing data near the training data support as natural advantages of the {GNN} architecture used for inference.},

High-resolution features (or tokens) are a natural fit for tasks that involve perceiving fine-grained details such as detection and segmentation, but exchanging global information between these features is expensive in memory and computation because of the way self-attention scales. We provide a highly efficient alternative Group Propagation Block ({GP} Block) to exchange global information. In each {GP} Block, features are first grouped together by a fixed number of learnable group tokens; we then perform Group Propagation where global information is exchanged between the grouped features; finally, global information in the updated grouped features is returned back to the image features through a transformer decoder. We evaluate {GPViT} on a variety of visual recognition tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Our method achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require high-resolution outputs, for example, our {GPViT}-L3 outperforms Swin Transformer-B by 2.0 m{IoU} on {ADE}20K semantic segmentation with only half as many parameters.},

This paper proposes a novel lighting representation that models direct and indirect light locally through a light sampling strategy in a learned light sampling field. We also propose {BRDF} models to separately represent surface/subsurface scattering details to enable complex objects such as translucent material (i.e., skin, jade). We then implement our proposed representations with an end-to-end physically-based neural face skin shader, which takes a standard face asset (i.e., geometry, albedo map, and normal map) and an {HDRI} for illumination as inputs and generates a photo-realistic rendering as output. Extensive experiments showcase the quality and efficiency of our {PBR} face skin shader, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed lighting and material representations.},

In response, we propose {UDDIA} (Unified Detoxifying and Debiasing via Inference-time Adaptive optimization), the first unified framework that jointly addresses both problems. We formalize detoxifying and debiasing as rectifying the output space, and {UDDIA} conducts adaptive optimization of only a few parameters during decoding using a parameter-efficient tuning schema without requiring training data. Compared to strong baselines, {UDDIA} achieves debiasing and detoxifying simultaneously while better balancing efficiency and effectiveness. It leads to minimal generation quality loss and improved performance with acceptable computational cost.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot class-incremental learning ({FSCIL}) has been a challenging problem as only a few training samples are accessible for each novel class in the new sessions. Finetuning the backbone or adjusting the classifier prototypes trained in the prior sessions would inevitably cause a misalignment between the feature and classifier of old classes, which explains the well-known catastrophic forgetting problem. In this paper, we deal with this misalignment dilemma in {FSCIL} inspired by the recently discovered phenomenon named neural collapse, which reveals that the last-layer features of the same class will collapse into a vertex, and the vertices of all classes are aligned with the classifier prototypes, which are formed as a simplex equiangular tight frame ({ETF}). It corresponds to an optimal geometric structure for classification due to the maximized Fisher Discriminant Ratio. We propose a neural collapse inspired framework for {FSCIL}. A group of classifier prototypes are pre-assigned as a simplex {ETF} for the whole label space, including the base session and all the incremental sessions. During training, the classifier prototypes are not learnable, and we adopt a novel loss function that drives the features into their corresponding prototypes. Theoretical analysis shows that our method holds the neural collapse optimality and does not break the feature-classifier alignment in an incremental fashion. Experiments on the mini{ImageNet}, {CUB}-200, and {CIFAR}-100 datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art performances.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel end-to-end framework with Explicit box Detection for multi-person Pose estimation, called {ED}-Pose, where it unifies the contextual learning between human-level (global) and keypoint-level (local) information. Different from previous one-stage methods, {ED}-Pose re-considers this task as two explicit box detection processes with a unified representation and regression supervision. First, we introduce a human detection decoder from encoded tokens to extract global features. It can provide a good initialization for the latter keypoint detection, making the training process converge fast. A human-to-keypoint detection decoder adopts an interactive learning strategy between human and keypoint features to further enhance global and local feature aggregation. In general, {ED}-Pose is conceptually simple without post-processing and dense heatmap supervision. It demonstrates its effectiveness and efficiency compared with both two-stage and one-stage methods. Notably, explicit box detection boosts the pose estimation performance by 4.5 {AP} on {COCO} and 9.9 {AP} on {CrowdPose}. For the first time, as a fully end-to-end framework with a {L}1 regression loss, {ED}-Pose surpasses heatmap-based Top-down methods under the same backbone by 1.2 {AP} on {COCO} and achieves the state-of-the-art with 76.6 {AP} on {CrowdPose} without bells and whistles.},

  abstract     = {Leveraging massive data to train large-scale models has become a predominant paradigm in {AI}. When it comes to video understanding, most existing approaches directly adapt such models to video data by end-to-end fine-tuning. Though seemingly straightforward, we find that this approach actually leads to limited performance gain and high training cost. In this paper, we propose a novel method to {A}dapt pre-trained {I}mage {M}odels ({AIM}) for efficient video understanding. By freezing the pre-trained image model and adding a few lightweight {A}dapters, we introduce spatial adaptation, temporal adaptation and joint adaptation to gradually equip an image model with spatiotemporal reasoning capability. We show that our proposed {AIM} can achieve competitive or even better performance than prior arts with substantially fewer tunable parameters on four video action recognition benchmarks. Thanks to its simplicity, the method is also generally applicable to different image pre-trained models, which has the potential to leverage more powerful image foundation models in the future.},

In Demasked Smoothing, any segmentation model can be applied without particular training, fine-tuning, or restriction of the architecture. Using different masking strategies, Demasked Smoothing can be applied both for certified detection and certified recovery. In extensive experiments we show that Demasked Smoothing can on average certify 63\% of the pixel predictions for a 1\% patch in the detection task and 46\% against a 0.5\% patch for the recovery task on the {ADE20K} dataset.},

In this work, we propose {GeneFace}, a generalized and high-fidelity {NeRF}-based talking face generation method, which can generate natural results corresponding to various out-of-domain audio. Specifically, we learn a variational motion generator on a large lip-reading corpus, and introduce a domain adaptative post-net to calibrate the result.

In this paper, we propose Flipped Learning, an alternative method of meta-training which trains the {LM} to generate the task instruction given the input instance and label. During inference, the {LM} trained with Flipped Learning, referred to as {FLIPPED}, selects the label option that is most likely to generate the task instruction. On 14 tasks of the {BIG}-bench benchmark, the 11B-sized {FLIPPED} outperforms zero-shot {T0}-11B and even a 16 times larger 3-shot {GPT}-3 (175B) on average by 8.4\% and 9.7\% points, respectively. {FLIPPED} gives particularly large improvements on tasks with unseen labels, outperforming {T0}-11B by up to +20\% average {F1} score. This indicates that the strong task generalization of {FLIPPED} comes from improved generalization to novel labels.},

The correlation shift is caused by the spurious attributes that correlate to the class label, as the correlation between them may vary in training and test data. For such a problem, we show that given the class label, the models that are conditionally independent of spurious attributes are {OOD} generalizable. Based on this, a metric Conditional Spurious Variation ({CSV}) which controls the {OOD} generalization error, is proposed to measure such conditional independence. To improve the {OOD} generalization, we regularize the training process with the proposed {CSV}. Under mild assumptions, our training objective can be formulated as a nonconvex-concave mini-max problem. An algorithm with a provable convergence rate is proposed to solve the problem.},

However, existing methods rely on the pseudo-labels generated by source models that can be noisy due to domain shift. In this paper, we study SFDA from the perspective of learning with label noise (LLN). Unlike the label noise in the conventional LLN scenario, we prove that the label noise in SFDA follows a different distribution assumption. We also prove that such a difference makes existing LLN methods that rely on their distribution assumptions unable to address the label noise in SFDA. Empirical evidence suggests that only marginal improvements are achieved when applying the existing LLN methods to solve the SFDA problem. On the other hand, although there exists a fundamental difference between the label noise in the two scenarios, we demonstrate theoretically that the early-time training phenomenon (ETP), which has been previously observed in conventional label noise settings, can also be observed in the SFDA problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements to existing SFDA algorithms by leveraging ETP to address the label noise in SFDA.},

In this work, we propose a Temporal Coherent Test-time Optimization framework (TeCo) to utilize spatio-temporal information in test-time optimization for robust video classification. To exploit information in video with self-supervised learning, TeCo minimizes the entropy of the prediction based on the global content from video clips. Meanwhile, it also feeds local content to regularize the temporal coherence at the feature level. TeCo retains the generalization ability of various video classification models and achieves significant improvements in corruption robustness across Mini Kinetics-C and Mini SSV2-C. Furthermore, TeCo sets a new baseline in video classification corruption robustness via test-time optimization.},

We address this problem by introducing a new data-driven approach, DINo, that models a PDE's flow with continuous-time dynamics of spatially continuous functions. This is achieved by embedding spatial observations independently of their discretization via Implicit Neural Representations in a small latent space temporally driven by a learned ODE. This separate and flexible treatment of time and space makes DINo the first data-driven model to combine the following advantages. It extrapolates at arbitrary spatial and temporal locations; it can learn from sparse irregular grids or manifolds; at test time, it generalizes to new grids or resolutions. DINo outperforms alternative neural PDE forecasters in a variety of challenging generalization scenarios on representative PDE systems.},

In this paper, we draw inspiration from multivariate Laplace distribution and propose a novel Rotation Laplace distribution on SO(3). Rotation Laplace distribution is robust to the disturbance of outliers and enforces much gradient to the low-error region, resulting in a better convergence. Our extensive experiments show that our proposed distribution achieves state-of-the-art performance for rotation regression tasks over both probabilistic and non-probabilistic baselines.},

Towards bridging the gap, we take a step by considering offline reinforcement learning with differentiable function class approximation (DFA). This function class naturally incorporates a wide range of models with nonlinear/nonconvex structures. Most importantly, we show offline RL with differentiable function approximation is provably efficient by analyzing the pessimistic fitted Q-learning (PFQL) algorithm, and our results provide the theoretical basis for understanding a variety of practical heuristics that rely on Fitted Q-Iteration style design. In addition, we further improve our guarantee with a tighter instance-dependent characterization.

In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that builds on the success of meta-gradient RL algorithms and effectively improves such algorithms by following a simple recipe, i.e., going beyond the expected return to formulate and learn the return in a more expressive form, value distributions. To this end, we first formulate a distributional return that could effectively capture bootstrapping and discounting behaviors over distributions, to form an informative distributional return target in value update. Then we derive an efficient meta update rule to learn the adaptive distributional return with meta-gradients. For empirical evaluation, we first present an illustrative example on a toy two-color grid-world domain, which validates the benefit of learning distributional return over expectation; then we conduct extensive comparisons on a large-scale RL benchmark Atari 2600, where we confirm that our proposed method with distributional return works seamlessly well with the actor-critic framework and leads to state-of-the-art median human normalized score among meta-gradient RL literature.},

  abstract     = {Studies have shown that modern neural networks tend to be poorly calibrated due to over-confident predictions. Traditionally, post-processing methods have been used to calibrate the model after training. In recent years, various trainable calibration measures have been proposed to incorporate them directly into the training process. However, these methods all incorporate internal hyperparameters, and the performance of these calibration objectives relies on tuning these hyperparameters, incurring more computational costs as the size of neural networks and datasets become larger. As such, we present Expected Squared Difference (ESD), a tuning-free (i.e., hyperparameter-free) trainable calibration objective loss, where we view the calibration error from the perspective of the squared difference between the two expectations. With extensive experiments on several architectures (CNNs, Transformers) and datasets, we demonstrate that (1) incorporating ESD into the training improves model calibration in various batch size settings without the need for internal hyperparameter tuning, (2) ESD yields the best-calibrated results compared with previous approaches, and (3) ESD drastically improves the computational costs required for calibration during training due to the absence of internal hyperparameter.},

Emerging methods attempt to learn domain-invariant representations using graph neural networks (GNNs), yet the empirical performances vary and the theoretical foundation is limited. This paper aims at designing theory-grounded algorithms for graph domain adaptation (GDA). As the first attempt, we derive a model-based GDA bound closely related to two GNN spectral properties: spectral smoothness (SS) and maximum frequency response (MFR). More importantly, our analyses of the theory reveal which regularization would improve performance of what transfer learning scenario, with numerical agreement with extensive real-world experiments: SS and MFR regularizations bring more benefits to the scenarios of node transfer and link transfer, respectively. In a nutshell, our study paves the way toward explicitly constructing and training GNNs that can capture more transferable representations across graph domains.},

In the commonly-used bilevel optimization formulation, the shared parameter is learned in the outer loop by minimizing the average loss over all tasks. However, the converged solution may be comprised in that it only focuses on optimizing on a small subset of tasks. To alleviate this problem, we consider meta-learning as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem, in which each task is an objective. However, existing MOO solvers need to access all the objectives' gradients in each iteration, and cannot scale to the huge number of tasks in typical meta-learning settings. To alleviate this problem, we propose a scalable gradient-based solver with the use of mini-batch.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks have witnessed huge successes in many challenging prediction tasks and yet they often suffer from out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, misclassifying them with high confidence. Recent advances show promising OoD detection performance for centralized training, and however, OoD detection in federated learning (FL) is largely overlooked, even though many security sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and voice recognition authorization are commonly trained using FL for data privacy concerns. The main challenge that prevents previous state-of-the-art OoD detection methods from being incorporated to FL is that they require large amount of real OoD samples. However, in real-world scenarios, such large-scale OoD training data can be costly or even infeasible to obtain, especially for resource-limited local devices. On the other hand, a notorious challenge in FL is data heterogeneity where each client collects non-identically and independently distributed (non-iid) data. We propose to take advantage of such heterogeneity and turn the curse into a blessing that facilitates OoD detection in FL. The key is that for each client, non-iid data from other clients (unseen external classes) can serve as an alternative to real OoD samples. Specifically, we propose a novel Federated Out-of-Distribution Synthesizer (FOSTER), which learns a class-conditional generator to synthesize virtual external-class OoD samples, and maintains data confidentiality and communication efficiency required by FL. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.49%, 2.88%, 1.42% AUROC, and 0.01%, 0.89%, 1.74% ID accuracy, on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL10, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic diagnosis is desirable when medical tests are costly or time-consuming. In this work, we use reinforcement learning (RL) to find a dynamic policy that selects lab test panels sequentially based on previous observations, ensuring accurate testing at a low cost. We aim to maximize the F1 score instead of accuracy due to highly imbalanced clinical diagnostic data. However, optimizing the non-concave F1 score is not a classic RL problem and invalidates standard RL methods. We develop a reward shaping approach, leveraging properties of the F1 score and duality of policy optimization, to provably find the set of all Pareto-optimal policies for budget-constrained F1 score maximization. We propose Semi-Model-based Deep Diagnosis Policy Optimization (SM-DDPO), a framework compatible with end-to-end training and online learning to handle the combinatorially complex state space. SM-DDPO is tested on three diverse clinical tasks: ferritin abnormality detection, sepsis mortality prediction, and acute kidney injury diagnosis. Experiments with real-world data validate that SM-DDPO trains efficiently and identifies all Pareto-front solutions, achieving state-of-the-art diagnosis accuracy with up to 85\% reduction in testing cost.},

  abstract     = {Recent state-of-the-art methods for imbalanced semi-supervised learning rely on confidence-based pseudo-labeling with consistency regularization. To obtain high-quality pseudo-labels, a high confidence threshold is typically adopted. However, it has been shown that softmax-based confidence scores in deep networks can be arbitrarily high for samples far from the training data, and thus, the pseudo-labels for even high-confidence unlabeled samples may still be unreliable. In this work, we present a new perspective of pseudo-labeling for imbalanced semi-supervised learning. Without relying on model confidence, we propose to measure whether an unlabeled sample is likely to be "in-distribution"; i.e., close to the current training data. To decide whether an unlabeled sample is "in-distribution" or "out-of-distribution", we adopt the energy score from out-of-distribution detection literature. As training progresses and more unlabeled samples become in-distribution and contribute to training, the combined labeled and pseudo-labeled data can better approximate the true class distribution to improve the model. Experiments demonstrate that our energy-based pseudo-labeling method, InPL, albeit conceptually simple, significantly outperforms confidence-based methods on imbalanced semi-supervised learning benchmarks.},

This limits the global model in terms of both model complexity and data capacity. In this paper, we propose CreamFL (Contrastive Representation Ensemble and Aggregation for Multimodal FL), a multimodal federated learning framework that enables training larger server models from clients with heterogeneous model architectures and data modalities. To achieve better multimodal representation fusion, we design a global-local cross-modal ensemble strategy to aggregate client representations. To mitigate local model drift caused by unprecedented heterogeneous factors stemming from multimodal discrepancy (modality gap and task gap), we propose two inter-modal and intra-modal contrasts to regularize local training, which complements information of the absent modality for uni-modal clients and regularizes local clients to head towards global consensus. Thorough evaluations and ablation studies on image-text retrieval and visual question answering tasks showcase the superiority of CreamFL over state-of-the-art FL methods and its practical value.},

It consists of two self-supervised pre-training tasks: masked image modeling and masked language modeling, based on text region-level image masking. We randomly mask some image regions according to the bounding box coordinates of text words. The objectives of the pre-training tasks are reconstructing the pixels of masked image regions and the corresponding masked tokens simultaneously. The pre-trained encoder can capture more textual semantics in comparison to the masked image modeling that usually predicts the masked image patches. Compared to masked multi-modal modeling methods for document image understanding that rely on both image and text modalities, StrucTexTv2 models image-only input and potentially deals with more application scenarios free from OCR pre-processing. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks of document image understanding demonstrate the effectiveness of StrucTexTv2. It achieves competitive or even new state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks such as image classification, layout analysis, table structure recognition, document OCR, and information extraction under the end-to-end scenario.},

We trained a single multi-task policy on a few hundred challenging robotic pick-and-place tasks. DeL-TaCo achieves superior performance compared to single-modality baselines and alternative multi-modal approaches, successfully generalizing to novel tasks with both seen and unseen task-relevant attributes.

Existing hyperbolic networks encode geometric priors not only for the input, but also at every layer of the network. This approach involves repeatedly mapping to and from hyperbolic space, which makes these networks complicated to implement, computationally expensive to scale, and numerically unstable to train. We propose a simpler approach: learn a hyperbolic embedding of the input, then map once from it to Euclidean space using a mapping that encodes geometric priors by respecting the isometries of hyperbolic space, and finish with a standard Euclidean network. The key insight is to use a random feature mapping via the eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator, which we show can approximate any isometry-invariant kernel on hyperbolic space. Our method can be used together with any graph neural networks: using even a linear graph model yields significant improvements in both efficiency and performance over other hyperbolic baselines in both transductive and inductive tasks.},

In this work, we use the NTK model and a data-dependent quadrature rule to theoretically quantify the frequency biasing of neural network training given fully nonuniform data. By replacing the loss function with a carefully selected Sobolev norm, we can amplify, dampen, counterbalance, or reverse the intrinsic frequency biasing in neural network training. We demonstrate this tunability on a variety of synthetic and realistic datasets and show that our approach can improve generalization and convergence properties of neural networks.},

We propose SIVI-SM, a new method for SIVI based on an alternative training objective via score matching. Leveraging the hierarchical structure of semi-implicit variational families, the score matching objective allows a minimax formulation where the intractable variational densities can be naturally handled with denoising score matching.

Specifically, {EUCLID} introduces a model-fused paradigm to jointly pre-train the dynamics model and unsupervised exploration policy. In this paradigm, a multi-choice dynamics model is designed to learn diverse behaviors from historical data, while an exploration policy is trained to maximize the information gain over the model. The model and policy are learned jointly in an online fashion, where the policy interacts with the environment and the model learns from the collected data. Our experimental results on navigation tasks show that {EUCLID} significantly outperforms previous {URL} methods in terms of learning efficiency and adaptation performance on downstream tasks.},

  abstract     = {This work aims to tackle a major challenge in offline Inverse Reinforcement Learning ({IRL}), namely the reward extrapolation error, where the learned reward function may fail to explain the task correctly and misguide the agent in unseen environments due to the intrinsic covariate shift. To address this challenge, we propose {CLARE}, a novel offline {IRL} algorithm that integrates conservatism into reward learning. {CLARE} leverages an estimated dynamics model to evaluate the discrepancy between expert and learned policy behaviors, and penalizes the reward function when the policy induced by the learned reward deviates from the expert policy. Our theoretical analysis shows that {CLARE} provides performance guarantees compared to the expert policy. Comprehensive experiments on both discrete and continuous control tasks demonstrate that {CLARE} significantly outperforms existing offline {IRL} methods and achieves robust performance even under severe distribution shift.},

  abstract     = {Despite the success of large vision and language models ({VLMs}) in many downstream applications, it is unclear how well they encode the compositional relationships between objects and attributes. Here, we create the Attribution, Relation, and Order ({ARO}) benchmark to systematically evaluate the ability of {VLMs} to understand different types of relationships, attributes, and order information. {ARO} consists of {Visual Genome Attribution}, to test the understanding of objects' properties; {Visual Genome Relation}, to test for relational understanding; and {COCO-Order} \& {Flickr30k-Order}, to test for order sensitivity in {VLMs}. {ARO} is orders of magnitude larger than previous benchmarks of compositionality, with more than 50,000 test cases. We present the settings where state-of-the-art {VLMs} behave like bags-of-words---i.e. when they have poor relational understanding, can blunder when linking objects to their attributes, and demonstrate a severe lack of order sensitivity. {VLMs} are predominantly trained and evaluated on large scale datasets with rich compositional structure in the images and captions. Yet, training on these datasets has not been enough to address the lack of compositional understanding, and evaluating on these datasets has failed to surface this deficiency. To understand why these limitations emerge and are not represented in the standard tests, we zoom into the evaluation and training procedures. We demonstrate that it is possible to perform well on image-text retrieval over existing datasets without using the composition and order information. This further motivates the value of using {ARO} to benchmark {VLMs}. Given that contrastive pretraining optimizes for retrieval on large datasets with similar shortcuts, we hypothesize that this can explain why the models do not need to learn to represent compositional information. This finding suggests a natural solution: composition-aware hard negative mining. We show that a simple-to-implement modification of contrastive learning significantly improves the performance on tasks requiring understanding of order and compositionality.},

  abstract     = {Concept Bottleneck Models ({CBMs}) map the inputs onto a set of interpretable concepts ("the bottleneck") and use the concepts to make predictions. A concept bottleneck enhances interpretability since it can be investigated to understand what concepts the model "sees" in an input and which of these concepts are deemed important. However, {CBMs} are restrictive in practice as they require dense concept annotations in the training data to learn the bottleneck. Moreover, {CBMs} often do not match the accuracy of an unrestricted neural network, reducing the incentive to deploy them in practice. In this work, we address these limitations of {CBMs} by introducing Post-hoc Concept Bottleneck models ({PCBMs}). We show that we can turn any neural network into a {PCBM} without sacrificing model performance while still retaining the interpretability benefits. When concept annotations are not available on the training data, we show that {PCBM} can transfer concepts from other datasets or from natural language descriptions of concepts via multimodal models. A key benefit of {PCBM} is that it enables users to quickly debug and update the model to reduce spurious correlations and improve generalization to new distributions. {PCBM} allows for global model edits, which can be more efficient than previous works on local interventions that fix a specific prediction. Through a model-editing user study, we show that editing {PCBMs} via concept-level feedback can provide significant performance gains without using data from the target domain or model retraining.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks ({DNNs}) are nowadays ubiquitous in many domains such as computer vision. However, due to their high latency, the deployment of {DNNs} hinges on the development of compression techniques such as quantization which consists in lowering the number of bits used to encode the weights and activations. Growing concerns for privacy and security have motivated the development of data-free techniques, at the expanse of accuracy. In this paper, we identity the uniformity of the quantization operator as a limitation of existing approaches, and propose a data-free non-uniform method. More specifically, we argue that to be readily usable without dedicated hardware and implementation, non-uniform quantization shall not change the nature of the mathematical operations performed by the {DNN}. This leads to search among the continuous automorphisms of $(\mathbb{R}_+^*,\times)$, which boils down to the power functions defined by their exponent. To find this parameter, we propose to optimize the reconstruction error of each layer: in particular, we show that this procedure is locally convex and admits a unique solution. At inference time, we show that our approach, dubbed {PowerQuant}, only require simple modifications in the quantized {DNN} activation functions. As such, with only negligible overhead, it significantly outperforms existing methods in a variety of configurations.},

We define diversity in terms of state-action occupancy measures, since policies with different occupancy measures visit different states on average. More importantly, defining diversity in this way allows us to derive an intrinsic reward function for maximizing the diversity directly. Our agent, {DOMiNO}, stands for Diversity Optimization Maintaining Near Optimally. It is based on maximizing a reward function with two components: the extrinsic reward and the diversity intrinsic reward, which are combined with {Lagrange} multipliers to balance the quality-diversity trade-off. Any {RL} algorithm can be used to maximize this reward and no other changes are needed. We demonstrate that given a simple reward functions in various control domains, like height (stand) and forward velocity (walk), {DOMiNO} discovers diverse and meaningful behaviours. We also perform extensive analysis of our approach, compare it with other multi-objective baselines, demonstrate that we can control both the quality and the diversity of the set via interpretable hyperparameters, and show that the set is robust to perturbations of the environment.},

Analogously, distilling such large models to compact models for efficient deployment also necessitates a large amount of (labeled or unlabeled) training data. In this paper, we propose the teacher-guided training ({TGT}) framework for training a high-quality compact model that leverages the knowledge acquired by pretrained generative models, while obviating the need to go through a large volume of data. {TGT} exploits the fact that the teacher has acquired a good representation of the underlying data domain, which typically corresponds to a much lower dimensional manifold than the input space. Furthermore, we can use the teacher to explore input space more efficiently through sampling or gradient-based methods; thus, making {TGT} especially attractive for limited data or long-tail settings. We formally capture this benefit of proposed data-domain exploration in our generalization bounds. We find that {TGT} can improve accuracy on several image classification benchmarks as well as a range of text classification and retrieval tasks.},

Relying on the well-known link between denoising autoencoders and score-matching, we show that the denoising objective corresponds to learning a molecular force field -- arising from approximating the Boltzmann distribution with a mixture of Gaussians -- directly from equilibrium structures.},

Low precision representations, achieved via quantization of weights and activations, can reduce inference time and memory requirements. However, quantifying and predicting the response of a model to the changes associated with this procedure remains challenging. This response is non-linear and heterogeneous throughout the network. Understanding which groups of parameters and activations are more sensitive to quantization than others is a critical stage in maximizing efficiency. For this purpose, we propose FIT. Motivated by an information geometric perspective, FIT combines the Fisher information with a model of quantization. We find that FIT can estimate the final performance of a network without retraining. FIT effectively fuses contributions from both parameter and activation quantization into a single metric.},

Past works have proposed common workarounds based on the pre-training of state representations, followed by policy training. In this work, we introduce a simple, yet effective approach for learning state representations. Our method, Behavior Prior Representation (BPR), learns state representations with an easy-to-integrate objective based on behavior cloning of the dataset: we first learn a state representation by mimicking actions from the dataset, and then train a policy on top of the fixed representation, using any off-the-shelf Offline RL algorithm. Theoretically, we prove that BPR carries out performance guarantees when integrated into algorithms that have either policy improvement guarantees (conservative algorithms) or produce lower bounds of the policy values (pessimistic algorithms). Empirically, we show that BPR combined with existing state-of-the-art Offline RL algorithms leads to significant improvements across several offline control benchmarks.},

Our approach optimizes over the polytope of permutation vectors, the so-called Permutahedron, to learn a topological ordering. Edges can be optimized jointly, or learned conditional on the ordering via a non-differentiable subroutine. Compared to existing continuous optimization approaches our formulation has a number of advantages including: 1. validity: optimizes over exact DAGs as opposed to other relaxations optimizing approximate DAGs; 2. modularity: accommodates any edge-optimization procedure, edge structural parameterization, and optimization loss; 3. end-to-end: either alternately iterates between node-ordering and edge-optimization, or optimizes them jointly. We demonstrate, on real-world data problems in protein-signaling and transcriptional network discovery, that our approach lies on the Pareto frontier of two key metrics, the SID and SHD.},

A verification mechanism is employed to filter out unreachable subgoals swiftly, allowing to focus on feasible further subgoals. In this way, AdaSubS benefits from the efficiency of planning with longer-term subgoals and the fine control with shorter-term ones, and thus scales well to difficult planning problems. We show that AdaSubS significantly surpasses hierarchical planning algorithms on three complex reasoning tasks: Sokoban, the Rubik's Cube, and the inequality-proving benchmark INT.},

As a result, these models store different forms of commonsense knowledge across different domains. In this work, we show that this diversity is symbiotic, and can be leveraged through Socratic Models (SMs): a modular framework in which multiple pretrained models may be composed zero-shot i.e., via multimodal-informed prompting, to exchange information with each other and capture new multimodal capabilities, without requiring finetuning. With minimal engineering, SMs are not only competitive with state-of-the-art zero-shot image captioning and video-to-text retrieval, but also enable new applications such as (i) answering free-form questions about egocentric video, (ii) engaging in multimodal assistive dialogue with people (e.g., for cooking recipes) by interfacing with external APIs and databases (e.g., web search), and (iii) robot perception and planning.},

How to learn representations that can preserve such structures among the classes remains an open problem. To approach this problem, given a tree of class hierarchy, we first define a tree metric between any pair of nodes in the tree to be the length of the shortest path connecting them. We then provide a method to learn the hierarchical relationship of class labels by approximately embedding the tree metric in the Euclidean space of features. More concretely, during supervised training, we propose to use the Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient (CPCC) as a regularizer for the cross-entropy loss to correlate the tree metric of classes and the Euclidean distance in the class-conditioned representations.},

We present an adversarial approach that overcomes this limitation, which we call competitive {PINNs} ({CPINNs}). {CPINNs} train a discriminator that is rewarded for predicting mistakes the {PINN} makes. The discriminator and {PINN} participate in a zero-sum game with the exact {PDE} solution as an optimal strategy. This approach avoids squaring the large condition numbers of {PDE} discretizations, which is the likely reason for failures of previous attempts to decrease {PINN} errors even on benign problems. Numerical experiments on a Poisson problem show that {CPINNs} achieve errors four orders of magnitude smaller than the best-performing {PINN}. We observe relative errors on the order of single-precision accuracy, consistently decreasing with each epoch. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time this level of accuracy and convergence behavior has been achieved. Additional experiments on the nonlinear Schrödinger, Burgers', and Allen--Cahn equation show that the benefits of {CPINNs} are not limited to linear problems.},

  abstract     = {A common assumption when training embodied agents is that the impact of taking an action is stable; for instance, executing the 'move ahead' action will always move the agent forward by a fixed distance, perhaps with some small amount of actuator-induced noise. This assumption is limiting; an agent may encounter settings that dramatically alter the impact of actions: a move ahead action on a wet floor may send the agent twice as far as it expects and using the same action with a broken wheel might transform the expected translation into a rotation. Instead of relying that the impact of an action stably reflects its pre-defined semantic meaning, we propose to model the impact of actions on-the-fly using latent embeddings. By combining these latent action embeddings with a novel, transformer-based, policy head, we design an Action Adaptive Policy (AAP).},

To reduce the communication cost, we propose SCoMoE, an MoE architecture with structured all-to-all communication, inspired by the hierarchical architecture of the communication topology. SCoMoE encourages data to be communicated across devices through fast intra-accelerator/node communication. To compensate the potential performance drop caused by the routing locality in SCoMoE, we further propose a token clustering approach to aggregating related tokens from different devices before the MoE layers. Experiments on bilingual and massively multilingual machine translation demonstrate that SCoMoE achieves a speedup of 1.44x over GShard with comparable performance, and substantially outperforms Gshard (2.8 BLEU) on OPUS-100 with a speedup of 1.25x.},

This results in datasets that contain both data variability and differing label styles. In this paper, we demonstrate that applying state-of-the-art segmentation uncertainty models on such datasets can lead to model bias caused by the different label styles. We present an updated modelling objective conditioning on labeling style for aleatoric uncertainty estimation, and modify two state-of-the-art-architectures for segmentation uncertainty accordingly.

However, despite significant progress in robustness verification for standard feed-forward architectures, the verification of high dimensional NODEs remains an open problem. We propose GAINS, an analysis framework for NODEs combining three key ideas: (i) a novel class of ODE solvers, based on variable but discrete time steps, (ii) an efficient graph representation of solver trajectories, and (iii) a novel abstraction algorithm operating on this graph representation. Together, these advances enable the efficient analysis and certified training of high-dimensional NODEs, by reducing the runtime from an intractable O(exp(d)+exp(T)) to O(d+T²log²T) in the dimensionality d and integration time T.},

But a line of recent work has empirically shown that these approaches do not significantly improve over ERM in real applications with distribution shift. The goal of this work is to obtain a comprehensive theoretical understanding of this intriguing phenomenon. We first posit the class of Generalized Reweighting (GRW) algorithms, as a broad category of approaches that iteratively update model parameters based on iterative reweighting of the training samples. We show that when overparameterized models are trained under GRW, the resulting models are close to that obtained by ERM.},

We develop a novel model-based algorithm for PSRs that can learn a near optimal policy in sample complexity scaling polynomially with respect to all the relevant parameters of the systems. Our algorithm naturally works with function approximation to extend to systems with potentially large state and observation spaces. We show that given a realizable model class, the sample complexity of learning the near optimal policy only scales polynomially with respect to the statistical complexity of the model class, without any explicit polynomial dependence on the size of the state and observation spaces.},

The contextual MIM and contrastive learning are synergetically performed in a loop to boost the best of two worlds: fast convergence and strong performance on downstream tasks without ad-hoc augmentations.},

In this paper, we study the case when calculations of explicit gradients are expensive or even infeasible, and only function values are accessible. Currently, there have two types of gradient-free (zeroth-order) methods based on random perturbation and negative curvature finding proposed to escape saddle points efficiently and converge to an ε-approximate second-order stationary point. Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent (AGD) method can escape saddle points faster than gradient descent (GD) which have been verified in first-order algorithms. However, whether AGD could accelerate the gradient-free methods is still unstudied. To unfold this mystery, in this paper, we propose two accelerated variants for the two types of gradient-free methods of escaping saddle points. Our algorithms can find an ε-approximate second-order stationary point with Õ(1/ε^{1.75}) iteration complexity and Õ(d/ε^{1.75}) oracle complexity, where d is the problem dimension. Our methods achieve a comparable convergence rate to their first-order counterparts and have fewer oracle complexity compared to prior derivative-free methods for finding second-order stationary points.},

We design a graph Transformer search space that includes both candidate architectures and various graph encodings. However, the joint optimization of graph encodings and architectures brings a new challenge: the structure-aware encoding-architecture correlation problem, i.e., a good architecture may fail with improper graph encodings, and vice versa. To solve this, we propose a novel encoding-aware performance estimation strategy by gradually training and splitting the supernets according to the correlations between graph encodings and architectures. This strategy can provide more consistent and fine-grained performance prediction when evaluating the jointly optimized graph encodings and architectures. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that AutoGT gains sufficient improvement over state-of-the-art hand-crafted baselines on all datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and wide applicability.},

However, existing methods have not uncovered a principled difficulty: the convoluted mixture distribution between clean and attacked data samples, which leads to sub-optimal model design and limits their frameworks' robustness.

The method includes a decoupling-based graph adversarial training where the component used to generate adversarial graphs is separated from the component used to update weights, and introduces graph diversity regularization to enable the model to learn diverse representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of GAME over state-of-the-art adversarial training methods across various datasets given different attacks.},

After learning the offline policy, we use it as one candidate policy in a policy set, and further learn another policy that will be responsible for further learning as an expansion to the policy set. The two policies will be composed in an adaptive manner for interacting with the environment. With this approach, the policy previously learned offline is fully retained during online learning, thus mitigating the potential issues such as destroying the useful behaviors of the offline policy in the initial stage of online learning while allowing the offline policy participate in the exploration naturally in an adaptive manner.},

To achieve this, we design a novel action space that allows flexible editing of the initial prompts covering a wide set of commonly-used components like instructions, few-shot exemplars, and verbalizers. At test-time, given a query, the agent adopts an attention-based policy to edit the instructions, in-context exemplars and verbalizers for T rounds. TEMPERA is gradient-free, the resulting prompt is interpretable and query-dependent. The proposed method achieves significant gains compared with recent SoTA approaches like prompt tuning, AutoPrompt, and RLPrompt, across a variety of tasks including sentiment analysis, topic classification, natural language inference, and reading comprehension.},

  abstract     = {The past few years have witnessed the great success of Diffusion models (DMs) in generating high-fidelity samples in generative modeling tasks. A major limitation of the DM is its notoriously slow sampling procedure which normally requires hundreds to thousands of time discretization steps of the learned diffusion process to reach the desired accuracy. Our goal is to develop a fast sampling method for DMs with a much less number of steps while retaining high sample quality. To this end, we systematically analyze the sampling procedure in DMs and identify key factors that affect the sample quality, among which the method of discretization is most crucial. By carefully examining the learned diffusion process, we propose Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS). It is based on the Exponential Integrator designed for discretizing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and leverages a semilinear structure of the learned diffusion process to reduce the discretization error. The proposed method can be applied to any DMs and can generate high-fidelity samples in as few as 10 steps. In our experiments, it takes about 3 minutes on one A6000 GPU to generate 50k images from CIFAR10. Moreover, by directly using pre-trained DMs, we achieve the state-of-art sampling performance when the number of score function evaluation (NFE) is limited, e.g., 4.17 FID with 10 NFEs, 3.37 FID, and 9.74 IS with only 15 NFEs on CIFAR10.},

  abstract     = {Fine-tuning large pre-trained language models on downstream tasks has become an important paradigm in NLP. However, common practice fine-tunes all of the parameters in a pre-trained model, which becomes prohibitive when a large number of downstream tasks are present. Therefore, many fine-tuning methods are proposed to learn incremental updates of pre-trained weights in a parameter efficient way, e.g., low-rank increments. These methods often evenly distribute the budget of incremental updates across all pre-trained weight matrices, and overlook the varying importance of different weight parameters. As a consequence, the fine-tuning performance is suboptimal. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaLoRA, which adaptively allocates the parameter budget among weight matrices according to their importance score. In particular, AdaLoRA parameterizes the incremental updates in the form of singular value decomposition. Such a novel approach allows us to effectively prune the singular values of unimportant updates, which is essentially to reduce their parameter budget but circumvent intensive exact SVD computations.},

In this work, we propose the adoption of latent variable policies within the MaxEnt framework, which we show can provably approximate any policy distribution, and additionally, naturally emerges under the use of world models with a latent belief state. We discuss why latent variable policies are difficult to train, how naive approaches can fail, then subsequently introduce a series of improvements centered around low-cost marginalization of the latent state, allowing us to make full use of the latent state at minimal additional cost. We instantiate our method under the actor-critic framework, marginalizing both the actor and critic. The resulting algorithm, referred to as Stochastic Marginal Actor-Critic (SMAC), is simple yet effective. We experimentally validate our method on continuous control tasks, showing that effective marginalization can lead to better exploration and more robust training.},

  abstract     = {Humans are remarkably good at understanding and reasoning about complex visual scenes. The capability of decomposing low-level observations into discrete objects allows us to build a grounded abstract representation and identify the compositional structure of the world. Thus it is a crucial step for machine learning models to be capable of inferring objects and their properties from visual scene without explicit supervision. However, existing works on object-centric representation learning are either relying on tailor-made neural network modules or assuming sophisticated models of underlying generative and inference processes. In this work, we present {EGO}, a conceptually simple and general approach to learning object-centric representation through energy-based model. By forming a permutation-invariant energy function using vanilla attention blocks that are readily available in {Transformers}, we can infer object-centric latent variables via gradient-based {MCMC} methods where permutation equivariance is automatically guaranteed. We show that {EGO} can be easily integrated into existing architectures, and can effectively extract high-quality object-centric representations, leading to better segmentation accuracy and competitive downstream task performance. We empirically evaluate the robustness of the learned representation from {EGO} against distribution shift. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of {EGO} in systematic compositional generalization, by recomposing learned energy functions for novel scene generation and manipulation.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge Distillation ({KD}) is a typical method for training a lightweight student model with the help of a well-trained teacher model. However, most {KD} methods require access to either the teacher's training data or model parameter, which is unrealistic. To tackle this problem, recent works study {KD} under data-free and black-box settings. Nevertheless, these works require a large number of queries to the teacher model, which incurs significant monetary and computational costs. To address these problems, we propose a novel method called query-efficient Data-free learning from black-box models ({IDEAL}), which aims to query-efficiently learn from black-box model {APIs} to train a good student without any real data. In detail, {IDEAL} trains the student model in two stages: data generation and model distillation. Note that {IDEAL} does not require any query in the data generation stage and queries the teacher only once for each sample in the distillation stage. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed {IDEAL}. For instance, {IDEAL} can improve the performance of the best baseline method {DFME} by 5.83\% on {CIFAR10} dataset with only 0.02x the query budget of {DFME}.},

  abstract     = {In silico prediction of the ligand binding pose to a given protein target is a crucial but challenging task in drug discovery. This work focuses on blind flexible self-docking, where we aim to predict the positions, orientations and conformations of docked molecules. Traditional physics-based methods usually suffer from inaccurate scoring functions and high inference cost. Recently, data-driven methods based on deep learning techniques are attracting growing interest thanks to their efficiency during inference and promising performance. These methods usually either adopt a two-stage approach by first predicting the distances between proteins and ligands and then generating the final coordinates based on the predicted distances, or directly predicting the global roto-translation of ligands. In this paper, we take a different route. Inspired by the resounding success of {AlphaFold2} for protein structure prediction, we propose {E3Bind}, an end-to-end equivariant network that iteratively updates the ligand pose. {E3Bind} models the protein-ligand interaction through careful consideration of the geometric constraints in docking and the local context of the binding site. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our end-to-end trainable model compared to traditional and recently-proposed deep learning methods.},

  abstract     = {Existing large language model-based code generation pipelines typically use beam search or sampling algorithms during the decoding process. Although the programs they generate achieve high token-matching-based scores, they often fail to compile or generate incorrect outputs. The main reason is that conventional {Transformer} decoding algorithms may not be the best choice for code generation. In this work, we propose a novel {Transformer} decoding algorithm, Planning-Guided {Transformer} Decoding ({PG-TD}), that uses a planning algorithm to do lookahead search and guide the {Transformer} to generate better programs. Specifically, instead of simply optimizing the likelihood of the generated sequences, the {Transformer} makes use of a planner that generates candidate programs and tests them on public test cases. The {Transformer} can therefore make more informed decisions and generate tokens that will eventually lead to higher-quality programs. We also design a mechanism that shares information between the {Transformer} and the planner to make our algorithm computationally efficient. We empirically evaluate our framework with several large language models as backbones on public coding challenge benchmarks, showing that 1) it can generate programs that consistently achieve higher performance compared with competing baseline methods; 2) it enables controllable code generation, such as concise codes and highly-commented codes by optimizing modified objective.},

Hence, it is of great difficulty to discriminate {OOD} data by directly adopting Softmax on output logits as the confidence score. Differently, we detect the {OOD} sample with {Hopfield} energy in a store-then-compare paradigm. In more detail, penultimate layer outputs on the training set are considered as the representations of in-distribution ({ID}) data. Thus they can be transformed into stored patterns that serve as anchors to measure the discrepancy of unseen data for {OOD} detection. Starting from the energy function defined in Modern {Hopfield} Network for the discrepancy score calculation, we derive a simplified version {SHE} with theoretical analysis. In {SHE}, we utilize only one stored pattern to present each class, and these patterns can be obtained by simply averaging the penultimate layer outputs of training samples within this class. {SHE} has the advantages of hyperparameter-free and high computational efficiency. The evaluations of nine widely-used {OOD} datasets show the promising performance of such a simple yet effective approach and its superiority over State-of-the-Art models.},

However, it is non-trivial to learn the optimal moment among many possible moments of starting translating, as the moments of starting translating always hide inside the model and can only be supervised with the observed target sequence. In this paper, we propose a Hidden {Markov} {Transformer} ({HMT}), which treats the moments of starting translating as hidden events and the target sequence as the corresponding observed events, thereby organizing them as a hidden {Markov} model. {HMT} explicitly models multiple moments of starting translating as the candidate hidden events, and then selects one to generate the target token. During training, by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the target sequence over multiple moments of starting translating, {HMT} learns to start translating at the moments that target tokens can be generated more accurately. Experiments on multiple {SiMT} benchmarks show that {HMT} outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

The problem becomes even more challenging when moving to category-level {6D} pose, which requires generalization to unseen instances. Current approaches are restricted by leveraging annotations from simulation or collected from humans. In this paper, we overcome this barrier by introducing a self-supervised learning approach trained directly on large-scale real-world object videos for category-level {6D} pose estimation in the wild. Our framework reconstructs the canonical {3D} shape of an object category and learns dense correspondences between input images and the canonical shape via surface embedding. For training, we propose novel geometrical cycle-consistency losses which construct cycles across {2D}-{3D} spaces, across different instances and different time steps. The learned correspondence can be applied for {6D} pose estimation and other downstream tasks such as keypoint transfer. Surprisingly, our method, without any human annotations or simulators, can achieve on-par or even better performance than previous supervised or semi-supervised methods on in-the-wild images.

The traditional process of diagnosing model behaviors in deployment settings involves labor-intensive data acquisition and annotation. Our proposed method can discover high-error data slices, identify influential attributes and further rectify undesirable model behaviors, without requiring any visual data. Through a combination of theoretical explanation and empirical verification, we present conditions under which classifiers trained on embeddings from one modality can be equivalently applied to embeddings from another modality.

  abstract     = {Learning high-quality representation is important and essential for visual recognition. Unfortunately, traditional representation learning suffers from fairness issues since the model may learn information of sensitive attributes. Recently, a series of studies have been proposed to improve fairness by explicitly decorrelating target labels and sensitive attributes. Most of these methods, however, rely on the assumption that fully annotated labels on target variable and sensitive attributes are available, which is unrealistic due to the expensive annotation cost. In this paper, we investigate a novel and practical problem of Fair Unsupervised Representation Learning with Partially annotated Sensitive labels ({FURL-PS}). {FURL-PS} has two key challenges: 1) how to make full use of the samples that are not annotated with sensitive attributes; 2) how to eliminate bias in the dataset without target labels. To address these challenges, we propose a general {Fairness-aware} Contrastive Learning ({FairCL}) framework consisting of two stages. Firstly, we generate contrastive sample pairs, which share the same visual information apart from sensitive attributes, for each instance in the original dataset. In this way, we construct a balanced and unbiased dataset. Then, we execute fair contrastive learning by closing the distance between representations of contrastive sample pairs. Besides, we also propose an unsupervised way to balance the utility and fairness of learned representations by feature reweighting. Extensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of fairness and utility, even with very limited sensitive attributes and serious data bias.},

In this paper, we propose {Batch-BALanCe}, a scalable batch-mode active learning algorithm, which combines insights from decision-theoretic active learning, combinatorial information measure, and diversity sampling. At its core, {Batch-BALanCe} relies on a novel decision-theoretic acquisition function that facilitates differentiation among different equivalence classes. Intuitively, each equivalence class consists of hypotheses (e.g., posterior samples of deep neural networks) with similar predictions, and {Batch-BALanCe} adaptively adjusts the size of the equivalence classes as learning progresses. To scale up the computation of queries to large batches, we further propose an efficient batch-mode acquisition procedure, which aims to maximize a novel combinatorial information measure defined through the acquisition function. We show that our algorithm can effectively handle realistic multi-class classification tasks, and achieves compelling performance on several benchmark datasets for active learning under both low- and large-batch regimes.},

While numerous approaches have been proposed to improve {GNN}s in terms of the {Weisfeiler-Lehman} ({WL}) test, generally there is still a lack of deep understanding of what additional power they can systematically and provably gain. We take a fundamentally different perspective to study the expressive power of {GNN}s beyond the {WL} test. Specifically, we introduce a novel class of expressivity metrics via graph biconnectivity and highlight their importance in both theory and practice. As biconnectivity can be easily calculated using simple algorithms that have linear computational costs, it is natural to expect that popular {GNN}s can learn it easily as well. However, we find that most {GNN} architectures are not expressive for biconnectivity metrics, with the only exception being the {ESAN} framework, for which we give a theoretical justification of its power. We proceed to introduce a principled and more efficient approach, called the {Generalized} {Distance} {Weisfeiler-Lehman} ({GD-WL}), which is provably expressive for all biconnectivity metrics. Practically, we show {GD-WL} can be implemented by a {Transformer-like} architecture that preserves expressiveness and enjoys full parallelizability. A set of experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that our approach can consistently outperform prior {GNN} architectures.},

Specifically, we propose a multilingual {PLM} called masked sentence model ({MSM}), which consists of a sentence encoder to generate the sentence representations, and a document encoder applied to a sequence of sentence vectors from a document. The document encoder is shared for all languages to model the universal sequential sentence relation across languages. To train the model, we propose a masked sentence prediction task, which masks and predicts the sentence vector via a hierarchical contrastive loss with sampled negatives. Comprehensive experiments on four cross-lingual retrieval tasks show {MSM} significantly outperforms existing advanced pre-training models, demonstrating the effectiveness and stronger cross-lingual retrieval capabilities of our approach.},

  abstract     = {Finding the best way to schedule operations in a computation graph is a classical {NP-hard} problem which is central to compiler optimization. However, evaluating the goodness of a schedule on the target hardware can be very time-consuming. Traditional approaches as well as previous machine learning ones typically optimize proxy metrics, which are fast to evaluate but can lead to bad schedules when tested on the target hardware. In this work, we propose a new approach to scheduling by sampling proportionally to the proxy metric using a novel {GFlowNet} method. We introduce a technique to control the trade-off between diversity and goodness of the proposed schedules at inference time and demonstrate empirically that the pure optimization baselines can lead to subpar performance with respect to our approach when tested on a target model. Furthermore, we show that conditioning the {GFlowNet} on the computation graph enables generalization to unseen scheduling problems for both synthetic and real-world compiler datasets.},

  abstract     = {Second-order optimization algorithms exhibit excellent convergence properties for training deep learning models, but often incur significant computation and memory overheads. This can result in lower training efficiency than the first-order counterparts such as stochastic gradient descent ({SGD}). In this work, we present a memory- and time-efficient second-order algorithm named {Eva} with two novel techniques: 1) we construct the second-order information with the {Kronecker} factorization of small stochastic vectors over a mini-batch of training data to reduce memory consumption, and 2) we derive an efficient update formula without explicitly computing the inverse of matrices using the {Sherman-Morrison} formula. We further provide a theoretical interpretation of {Eva} from a trust-region optimization point of view to understand how it works. Extensive experimental results on different models and datasets show that {Eva} reduces the end-to-end training time up to {$2.05\times$} and {$2.42\times$} compared to first-order {SGD} and second-order algorithms ({K-FAC} and {Shampoo}), respectively.},

  abstract     = {Time series modeling is a well-established problem, which often requires that methods (1) expressively represent complicated dependencies, (2) forecast long horizons, and (3) efficiently train over long sequences. State-space models ({SSM}s) are classical models for time series that can be combined with deep learning, but prior deep {SSM} approaches have had limitations. We introduce {SpaceTime}, a new state-space time series architecture that improves all three criteria. For expressivity, we provide a novel {SSM} parameterization based on the companion matrix---a canonical representation for discrete-time processes---which enables {SpaceTime}'s {SSM} layers to learn desirable autoregressive processes that prior approaches could not express. For long horizon forecasting, we introduce a ``closed-loop'' variation of the companion {SSM} that can predict many future time-steps by generating its own layer-wise inputs. For efficiency, we provide an algorithm that reduces the memory and compute of a forward pass with the companion matrix from {$\tilde{O}(d\ell)$} naively to {$\tilde{O}(d + \ell)$} with sequence length {$\ell$} and state-space size {$d$}. In experiments, our contributions lead to state-of-the-art results on extensive and diverse benchmarks, with best or second-best {AUROC} on 6/7 {ECG} and speech time series classification, and best {MSE} on 14/16 Informer forecasting tasks.},

  abstract     = {Invariant risk minimization ({IRM}) has received increasing attention as a way to acquire environment-agnostic data representations and predictions, and also a principled solution for preventing spurious correlations from being learned and improving models' out-of-distribution generalization. Yet, the real-world performance of {IRM} is mixed. In this paper, we identify and resolve three key issues that are critical for {IRM} training and evaluation. (1) On the optimization side, we observe that the optimization of {IRM} is unstable and sometimes fails to converge to the IRM solution, especially with large penalty weights. We develop a simple optimization remedy via \textrm{re-scaling} the penalty term in {ERM} updates. (2) On the evaluation side, we find that the choices of environments for training or testing can be sensitive for {IRM}. When there are multiple available environments, the selection of environments can affect the optimization and the solutions for invariant predictors. We propose to diversify training and out-of-distribution ({OOD}) test environments to evaluate model performance comprehensively. (3) Moreover, we discover that {IRM} can fail to find the optimal invariant predictor even when there is only one invariant predictor (e.g., with 2 training environments). We propose using multiple instances of the model induced by the same {IRM} objective but with different random initialization to find one that approximately matches the invariant predictor.},

  abstract     = {Multi-view image compression plays a critical role in 3D-related applications. Existing methods adopt a predictive coding architecture, which requires joint encoding to compress the corresponding disparity as well as residual information. This demands collaboration among cameras and enforces the epipolar geometric constraint between different views, which makes it challenging to deploy these methods in distributed camera systems with randomly overlapping fields of view. Meanwhile, distributed source coding theory indicates that efficient data compression of correlated sources can be achieved by independent encoding and joint decoding, which motivates us to design a learning-based distributed multi-view image coding ({LDMIC}) framework. With independent encoders, {LDMIC} introduces a simple yet effective joint context transfer module based on the cross-attention mechanism at the decoder to effectively capture the global inter-view correlations, which is insensitive to the geometric relationships between images. Experimental results show that {LDMIC} significantly outperforms both traditional and learning-based {MIC} methods while enjoying fast encoding speed.},

Instead of constructing a non-Markov noising process as in the original {DDIM}, we examine the mechanism of {DDIM} from a numerical perspective. We discover that the {DDIM} can be obtained by using some specific approximations of the score when solving the corresponding stochastic differential equation. We present an interpretation of the accelerating effects of {DDIM} that also explains the advantages of a deterministic sampling scheme over the stochastic one for fast sampling. Building on this insight, we extend {DDIM} to general {DMs}, coined generalized {DDIM} (g{DDIM}), with a small but delicate modification in parameterizing the score network. We validate g{DDIM} in two non-isotropic {DMs}: Blurring diffusion model ({BDM}) and Critically-damped Langevin diffusion model ({CLD}). We observe more than 20 times acceleration in {BDM}. In the {CLD}, a diffusion model by augmenting the diffusion process with velocity, our algorithm achieves an {FID} score of 2.26, on {CIFAR}10, with only 50 number of score function evaluations ({NFEs}) and an {FID} score of 2.86 with only 27 {NFEs}.},

We consider a ``Parallel {NN}'' variant of deep {ReLU} networks and show that the standard weight decay is equivalent to promoting the $\ell_p$-sparsity ($0<p<1$) of the coefficient vector of an end-to-end learned function bases, i.e., a dictionary. Using this equivalence, we further establish that by tuning only the weight decay, such Parallel {NN} achieves an estimation error arbitrarily close to the minimax rates for both the Besov and {BV} classes. Notably, it gets exponentially closer to minimax optimal as the {NN} gets deeper.},

Among various approaches, exploiting invariant features by Domain Adversarial Training ({DAT}) has received widespread attention. Despite its success, we observe training instability from {DAT}, mostly due to over-confident domain discriminator and environment label noise. To address this issue, we propose Environment Label Smoothing ({ELS}), which encourages the discriminator to output soft probability, which thus reduces the confidence of the discriminator and alleviates the impact of noisy environment labels. We demonstrate, both experimentally and theoretically, that {ELS} can improve training stability, local convergence, and robustness to noisy environment labels. Comprehensive experiments on image classification, image retrieval, neural language processing, genomics, graph, and sequential prediction tasks show that our method can significantly outperform existing domain adversarial training methods.},

Existing approaches usually pretrain protein language models on a large number of unlabeled amino acid sequences and then finetune the models with some labeled data in downstream tasks. However, despite the effectiveness of sequence-based approaches, the power of pretraining on known protein structures, which are available in smaller numbers only, has not been explored for protein property prediction, though protein structures are known to be determinants of protein function. In this paper, we propose to pretrain protein representations according to their {3D} structures. We first present a simple yet effective encoder, namely {GearNet}, to learn the geometric features of a protein. We then pretrain the protein graph encoder by leveraging multiview contrastive learning and different self-prediction tasks. Experimental results on both function prediction and fold classification tasks show that our proposed pretraining methods outperform or are on par with the state-of-the-art sequence-based methods, while using much less pretraining data.},

We strive to reformulate the conventional model inference pipeline into a graph matching policy that associates the extracted visual concepts of an image with the pre-computed scene impression, by analogy with human reasoning mechanism via impression matching. To this end, we devise an elaborated architecture, termed as {SchemaNet}, as a dedicated instantiation of the proposed schema inference concept, that models both the visual semantics of input instances and the learned abstract imaginations of target categories as topological relational graphs. Meanwhile, to capture and leverage the compositional contributions of visual semantics in a global view, we also introduce a universal {Feat2Graph} scheme in {SchemaNet} to establish the relational graphs that contain abundant interaction information. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed schema inference achieves encouraging performance and meanwhile yields a clear picture of the deductive process leading to the predictions.},

By solving it with dynamic programming, we learn a conservative value estimate that only considers transitions observed in the replay memory. Both value and policy regularizers based on this conservative estimate are developed and integrated with model-free learning algorithms.

To fill the gap, we propose Crossformer, a Transformer-based model utilizing cross-dimension dependency for {MTS} forecasting. In Crossformer, the input {MTS} is embedded into a {2D} vector array through the Dimension-Segment-Wise ({DSW}) embedding to preserve time and dimension information. Then the Two-Stage Attention ({TSA}) layer is proposed to efficiently capture the cross-time and cross-dimension dependency. Utilizing {DSW} embedding and {TSA} layer, Crossformer establishes a Hierarchical Encoder-Decoder ({HED}) to use the information at different scales for the final forecasting. Extensive experimental results on six real-world datasets show the effectiveness of Crossformer against previous state-of-the-arts.},

We perform reconstruction and backtracking on the model representations optimized by Bort and observe a clear improvement in model explainability. Based on Bort, we are able to synthesize explainable adversarial samples without additional parameters and training.

Through extensive experiments on 8 public datasets, {LMADA} achieved 74\% {F1}-Score improvement on average, outperforming other comparative {AAD} approaches. Besides, {LMADA} can also achieve significant performance boosting under any unsupervised detectors.},

To lower computational cost, existing works generally limit self-attention computation within non-overlapping windows. However, each group of tokens are always from a dense area of the image. This is considered as a dense attention strategy since the interactions of tokens are restrained in dense regions. Obviously, this strategy could result in restricted receptive fields. To address this issue, we propose Attention Retractable Transformer ({ART}) for image restoration, which presents both dense and sparse attention modules in the network. The sparse attention module allows tokens from sparse areas to interact and thus provides a wider receptive field.},

  abstract     = {Stabilization of the systems described by stochastic delay-differential equations ({SDDEs}) under preset conditions is a challenging task in the control community. Here, to achieve this task, we leverage neural networks to learn control policies using the information of the controlled systems in some prescribed regions. Specifically, two learned control policies, i.e., the neural deterministic controller ({NDC}) and the neural stochastic controller ({NSC}), work effectively in the learning procedures that rely on, respectively, the well-known {LaSalle}-type theorem and the newly-established theorem for guaranteeing the stochastic stability in {SDDEs}. We theoretically investigate the performance of the proposed controllers in terms of convergence time and energy cost. More practically and significantly, we improve our learned control policies through considering the situation where the controlled trajectories only evolve in some specific safety set. The practical validity of such control policies restricted in safety set is attributed to the theory that we further develop for safety and stability guarantees in {SDDEs} using the stochastic control barrier function and the spatial discretization. We call this control as {SYNC} (Safety-aware Neural Control). The efficacy of all the articulated control policies, including the {SYNC}, is demonstrated systematically by using representative control problems.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of various multi-agent environments has motivated powerful algorithms to explore agents' cooperation or competition. Even though this has greatly promoted the development of multi-agent reinforcement learning ({MARL}), it is still not enough to support further exploration on the behavior of swarm intelligence between multiple teams, and cooperation between multiple agents due to their limited scalability. To alleviate this, we introduce {GoBigger}, a scalable platform for cooperative-competition multi-agent interactive simulation. {GoBigger} is an enhanced environment for the {Agar}-like game, enabling the simulation of multiple scales of agent intra-team cooperation and inter-team competition. Compared with existing multi-agent simulation environments, our platform supports multi-team games with more than two teams simultaneously, which dramatically expands the diversity of agent cooperation and competition, and can more effectively simulate the swarm intelligent agent behavior. Besides, in {GoBigger}, the cooperation between the agents in a team can lead to much higher performance. We offer a diverse set of challenging scenarios, built-in bots, and visualization tools for best practices in benchmarking. We evaluate several state-of-the-art algorithms on {GoBigger} and demonstrate the potential of the environment. We believe this platform can inspire various emerging research directions in {MARL}, swarm intelligence, and large-scale agent interactive learning.},

  abstract     = {Fully test-time adaptation aims at adapting a pre-trained model to the test stream during real-time inference, which is urgently required when the test distribution differs from the training distribution. Several efforts have been devoted to improving adaptation performance. However, we find that two unfavorable defects are concealed in the prevalent adaptation methodologies like test-time batch normalization ({BN}) and self-learning. First, we reveal that the normalization statistics in test-time {BN} are completely affected by the currently received test samples, resulting in inaccurate estimates. Second, we show that during test-time adaptation, the parameter update is biased towards some dominant classes. In addition to the extensively studied test stream with independent and class-balanced samples, we further observe that the defects can be exacerbated in more complicated test environments, such as (time) dependent or class-imbalanced data. We observe that previous approaches work well in certain scenarios while show performance degradation in others due to their faults. In this paper, we provide a plug-in solution called {DELTA} for Degradation-freE fuLly Test-time Adaptation, which consists of two components: (i) Test-time Batch Renormalization ({TBR}), introduced to improve the estimated normalization statistics. (ii) Dynamic Online re-weighTing ({DOT}), designed to address the class bias within optimization. We investigate various test-time adaptation methods on three commonly used datasets with four scenarios, and a newly introduced real-world dataset. {DELTA} can help them deal with all scenarios simultaneously, leading to {SOTA} performance.},

Utilizing the gradients of detector targets flowing into the intermediate feature maps, {ODAM} produces heat maps that show the influence of regions on the detector's decision for each predicted attribute. Compared to previous works classification activation maps ({CAM}), {ODAM} generates instance-specific explanations rather than class-specific ones. We show that {ODAM} is applicable to both one-stage detectors and two-stage detectors with different types of detector backbones and heads, and produces higher-quality visual explanations than the state-of-the-art both effectively and efficiently. We next propose a training scheme, Odam-Train, to improve the explanation ability on object discrimination of the detector through encouraging consistency between explanations for detections on the same object, and distinct explanations for detections on different objects. Based on the heat maps produced by {ODAM} with Odam-Train, we propose Odam-{NMS}, which considers the information of the model's explanation for each prediction to distinguish the duplicate detected objects. We present a detailed analysis of the visualized explanations of detectors and carry out extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed {ODAM}.},

Empirical studies show that {SSL} can achieve promising performance in distribution shift scenarios, where the downstream and training distributions differ. However, the theoretical understanding of its transferability remains limited. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze the transferability of self-supervised contrastive learning, by investigating the impact of data augmentation on it. Our results reveal that the downstream performance of contrastive learning depends largely on the choice of data augmentation. Moreover, we show that contrastive learning fails to learn domain-invariant features, which limits its transferability. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose a novel method called Augmentation-robust Contrastive Learning ({ArCL}), which guarantees to learn domain-invariant features and can be easily integrated with existing contrastive learning algorithms. We conduct experiments on several datasets and show that {ArCL} significantly improves the transferability of contrastive learning.},

By mimicking the diagnosis process of radiologists, we attempt to tackle this problem by learning a tractable distribution of normal images and identify anomalies by differentiating the original image and the reconstructed normal image. More specifically, we propose a normalizing flow-based autoencoder for an efficient and tractable representation of normal medical images. The anomaly score consists of the likelihood originated from the normalizing flow and the reconstruction error of the autoencoder, which allows to identify the abnormality and provide an interpretability at both image and pixel levels. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed method outperformed other approaches by a large margin, which validated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.},

Yet, little is known about the theoretical origin of such valleys. We present a general framework for finding continuous symmetries in the parameter space, which carve out low-loss valleys. Our framework uses equivariances of the activation functions and can be applied to different layer architectures. To generalize this framework to nonlinear neural networks, we introduce a novel set of nonlinear, data-dependent symmetries. These symmetries can transform a trained model such that it performs similarly on new samples, which allows ensemble building that improves robustness under certain adversarial attacks. We then show that conserved quantities associated with linear symmetries can be used to define coordinates along low-loss valleys. The conserved quantities help reveal that using common initialization methods, gradient flow only explores a small part of the global minimum. By relating conserved quantities to convergence rate and sharpness of the minimum, we provide insights on how initialization impacts convergence and generalizability.},

However, {TransMix} is deficient in two aspects: 1) The image cropping method of {TransMix} may not be suitable for {ViTs}. 2) At the early stage of training, the model produces unreliable attention maps. {TransMix} uses unreliable attention maps to compute mixed attention labels that can affect the model. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose {MaskMix} and Progressive Attention Labeling ({PAL}) in image and label space, respectively. In detail, from the perspective of image space, we design {MaskMix}, which mixes two images based on a patch-like grid mask. In particular, the size of each mask patch is adjustable and is a multiple of the image patch size, which ensures each image patch comes from only one image and contains more global contents. From the perspective of label space, we design {PAL}, which utilizes a progressive factor to dynamically re-weight the attention weights of the mixed attention label. Finally, we combine {MaskMix} and Progressive Attention Labeling as our new data augmentation method, named {MixPro}. The experimental results show that our method can improve various {ViT}-based models at scales on {ImageNet} classification (73.8\% top-1 accuracy based on {DeiT}-T for 300 epochs). After being pre-trained with {MixPro} on {ImageNet}, the {ViT}-based models also demonstrate better transferability to semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Furthermore, compared to {TransMix}, {MixPro} also shows stronger robustness on several benchmarks.},

While {MLE} trained models assign high probability to plausible sequences given the context, the model probabilities often do not accurately rank-order generated sequences by quality. This has been empirically observed in beam search decoding as output quality degrading with large beam sizes, and decoding strategies benefiting from heuristics such as length normalization and repetition-blocking. In this work, we introduce sequence likelihood calibration ({SLiC}) where the likelihood of model generated sequences are calibrated to better align with reference sequences in the model's latent space. With {SLiC}, decoding heuristics become unnecessary and decoding candidates' quality significantly improves regardless of the decoding method. Furthermore, {SLiC} shows no sign of diminishing returns with model scale, and presents alternative ways to improve quality with limited training and inference budgets. With {SLiC}, we exceed or match {SOTA} results on a wide range of generation tasks spanning abstractive summarization, question generation, abstractive question answering and data-to-text generation, even with modest-sized models.},

In this work, we explore whether more layers are beneficial to graph transformers, and find that current graph transformers suffer from the bottleneck of improving performance by increasing depth. Our further analysis reveals the reason is that deep graph transformers are limited by the vanishing capacity of global attention, restricting the graph transformer from focusing on the critical substructure and obtaining expressive features. To this end, we propose a novel graph transformer model named {DeepGraph} that explicitly employs substructure tokens in the encoded representation, and applies local attention on related nodes to obtain substructure based attention encoding. Our model enhances the ability of the global attention to focus on substructures and promotes the expressiveness of the representations, addressing the limitation of self-attention as the graph transformer deepens. Experiments show that our method unblocks the depth limitation of graph transformers and results in state-of-the-art performance across various graph benchmarks with deeper models.},

While crucial for the deployment on resource-constraint hardware, oftentimes, compression comes with a severe drop in accuracy and lack of adversarial robustness. Despite recent advances, counteracting both aspects has only succeeded for moderate compression rates so far. We propose a novel method, {HARP}, that copes with aggressive pruning significantly better than prior work. For this, we consider the network holistically. We learn a global compression strategy that optimizes how many parameters (compression rate) and which parameters (scoring connections) to prune specific to each layer individually. Our method fine-tunes an existing model with dynamic regularization, that follows a step-wise incremental function balancing the different objectives. It starts by favoring robustness before shifting focus on reaching the target compression rate and only then handles the objectives equally. The learned compression strategies allow us to maintain the pre-trained model's natural accuracy and its adversarial robustness for a reduction by 99\% of the network's original size. Moreover, we observe a crucial influence of non-uniform compression across layers.},

We propose a faster and cheaper approach that adds noise not until the data become pure random noise, but until they reach a hidden noisy data distribution that we can confidently learn. Then, we use fewer reverse steps to generate data by starting from this hidden distribution that is made similar to the noisy data. We reveal that the proposed model can be cast as an adversarial auto-encoder empowered by both the diffusion process and a learnable implicit prior.

  abstract     = {One-shot coreset selection aims to select a representative subset of the training data, given a pruning rate, that can later be used to train future models while retaining high accuracy. State-of-the-art coreset selection methods pick the highest importance examples based on an importance metric and are found to perform well at low pruning rates. However, at high pruning rates, they suffer from a catastrophic accuracy drop, performing worse than even random sampling. This paper explores the reasons behind this accuracy drop both theoretically and empirically. We first propose a novel metric to measure the coverage of a dataset on a specific distribution by extending the classical geometric set cover problem to a distribution cover problem. This metric helps explain why coresets selected by SOTA methods at high pruning rates perform poorly compared to random sampling because of worse data coverage. We then propose a novel one-shot coreset selection method, Coverage-centric Coreset Selection (CCS), that jointly considers overall data coverage upon a distribution as well as the importance of each example. We evaluate CCS on five datasets and show that, at high pruning rates (e.g., 90%), it achieves significantly better accuracy than previous SOTA methods (e.g., at least 19.56% higher on CIFAR10) as well as random selection (e.g., 7.04% higher on CIFAR10) and comparable accuracy at low pruning rates.},

Existing work focuses on specific families of distributions (e.g., exponential families) and/or certain structures of graphs, and most of them can only handle variables of a single data type (continuous or discrete). In this work, we characterize the conditional independence structure in general distributions for all data types (i.e., continuous, discrete, and mixed-type) with a Generalized Precision Matrix (GPM). Besides, we also allow general functional relations among variables, thus giving rise to a Markov network structure learning algorithm in one of the most general settings. To deal with the computational challenge of the problem, especially for large graphs, we unify all cases under the same umbrella of a regularized score matching framework. We validate our method with extensive empirical experiments and show that our method achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a regularization loss based on kernel mean embeddings with rotation-invariant kernels on the hypersphere (also known as dot-product kernels) for self-supervised learning of image representations. Besides being fully competitive with the state of the art, our method significantly reduces time and memory complexity for self-supervised training, making it implementable for very large embedding dimensions on existing devices and more easily adjustable than previous methods to settings with limited resources. Our work follows the major paradigm where the model learns to be invariant to some predefined image transformations (cropping, blurring, color jittering, etc.), while avoiding a degenerate solution by regularizing the embedding distribution. Our particular contribution is to propose a loss family promoting the embedding distribution to be close to the uniform distribution on the hypersphere, with respect to the maximum mean discrepancy pseudometric. We demonstrate that this family encompasses several regularizers of former methods, including uniformity-based and information-maximization methods, which are variants of our flexible regularization loss with different kernels. Beyond its practical consequences for state-of-the-art self-supervised learning with limited resources, the proposed generic regularization approach opens perspectives to leverage more widely the literature on kernel methods in order to improve self-supervised learning methods.},

  abstract     = {The conventional few-shot classification aims at learning a model on a large labeled base dataset and rapidly adapting to a target dataset that is from the same distribution as the base dataset. However, in practice, the base and the target datasets of few-shot classification are usually from different domains, which is the problem of cross-domain few-shot classification. We tackle this problem by making a small proportion of unlabeled images in the target domain accessible in the training stage. In this setup, even though the base data are sufficient and labeled, the large domain shift still makes transferring the knowledge from the base dataset difficult. We meticulously design a cross-level knowledge distillation method, which can strengthen the ability of the model to extract more discriminative features in the target dataset by guiding the network's shallow layers to learn higher-level information. Furthermore, in order to alleviate the overfitting in the evaluation stage, we propose a feature denoising operation which can reduce the feature redundancy and mitigate overfitting. Our approach can surpass the previous state-of-the-art method, Dynamic-Distillation, by 5.44\% on 1-shot and 1.37\% on 5-shot classification tasks on average in the BSCD-FSL benchmark.},

In this paper, we provide both practical and theoretical insights on the empirical success of the probabilistic dynamics model ensemble through the lens of Lipschitz continuity. We find that, for a value function, the stronger the Lipschitz condition is, the smaller the gap between the true dynamics- and learned dynamics-induced Bellman operators is, thus enabling the converged value function to be closer to the optimal value function. Hence, we hypothesize that the key functionality of the probabilistic dynamics model ensemble is to regularize the Lipschitz condition of the value function using generated samples. To validate this hypothesis, we devise two practical robust training mechanisms through computing the adversarial noise and regularizing the value network's spectral norm to directly regularize the Lipschitz condition of the value functions. Empirical results show that combined with our mechanisms, model-based RL algorithms with a single dynamics model outperform those with ensemble of the probabilistic dynamics models. These findings not only support the theoretical insight, but also provide a practical solution for developing computationally efficient model-based RL algorithms.},

This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate, and allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.},

It allows hospitals/institutions to train models with sufficient data while the data is kept private. To make sure the {FL} model is robust when facing heterogeneous data among {FL} clients, most efforts focus on personalizing models for clients. However, the latent relationships between clients' data are ignored. In this work, we focus on a special non-iid {FL} problem, called Domain-mixed {FL}, where each client's data distribution is assumed to be a mixture of several predefined domains. Recognizing the diversity of domains and the similarity within domains, we propose a novel method, {FedDAR}, which learns a domain shared representation and domain-wise personalized prediction heads in a decoupled manner. For simplified linear regression settings, we have theoretically proved that {FedDAR} enjoys a linear convergence rate. For general settings, we have performed intensive empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world medical datasets which demonstrate its superiority over prior {FL} methods.

Inspired by the classical perspective of the bias-variance tradeoff, we propose regularized deep generative model ({Reg-DGM}), which leverages a nontransferable pre-trained model to reduce the variance of generative modeling with limited data. Formally, {Reg-DGM} optimizes a weighted sum of a certain divergence and the expectation of an energy function, where the divergence is between the data and the model distributions, and the energy function is defined by the pre-trained model w.r.t. the model distribution. We analyze a simple yet representative {Gaussian}-fitting case to demonstrate how the weighting hyperparameter trades off the bias and the variance. Theoretically, we characterize the existence and the uniqueness of the global minimum of {Reg-DGM} in a non-parametric setting and prove its convergence with neural networks trained by gradient-based methods. Empirically, with various pre-trained feature extractors and a data-dependent energy function, {Reg-DGM} consistently improves the generation performance of strong {DGMs} with limited data and achieves competitive results to the state-of-the-art methods.

This makes it impossible for models of code to keep current with all available {APIs} by simply training these models on existing code repositories. Thus, existing models inherently cannot generalize to using unseen functions and libraries, because these would never appear in the training data. In contrast, when human programmers use functions and libraries for the first time, they frequently refer to textual resources such as code manuals and documentation, to explore and understand the available functionality. Inspired by this observation, we introduce {DocPrompting}: a natural-language-to-code generation approach that explicitly leverages documentation by (1) retrieving the relevant documentation pieces given an {NL} intent, and (2) generating code based on the {NL} intent and the retrieved documentation. {DocPrompting} is general: it can be applied to any programming language and is agnostic to the underlying neural model. We demonstrate that {DocPrompting} consistently improves {NL}-to-code models: {DocPrompting} improves strong base models such as {CodeT5} by 2.85\% in pass@1 (52\% relative gain) and 4.39\% in pass@10 (30\% relative gain) in execution-based evaluation on the popular {Python} {CoNaLa} benchmark; on a new {Bash} dataset tldr, {DocPrompting} improves {CodeT5} and {GPT-Neo1}.3{B} by up to absolute 6.9\% exact match.},

  abstract     = {A central theme in federated learning ({FL}) is the fact that client data distributions are often not independent and identically distributed ({IID}), which has strong implications on the training process. While most existing {FL} algorithms focus on the conventional non-{IID} setting of class imbalance or missing classes across clients, in practice, the distribution differences could be more complex, e.g., changes in class conditional (domain) distributions. In this paper, we consider this complex case in {FL} wherein each client has access to only one domain distribution. For tasks such as domain generalization, most existing learning algorithms require access to data from multiple clients (i.e., from multiple domains) during training, which is prohibitive in {FL}. To address this challenge, we propose a federated domain translation method that generates pseudodata for each client which could be useful for multiple downstream learning tasks. We empirically demonstrate that our translation model is more resource-efficient (in terms of both communication and computation) and easier to train in an {FL} setting than standard domain translation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the learned translation model enables use of state-of-the-art domain generalization methods in a federated setting, which enhances accuracy and robustness to increases in the synchronization period compared to existing methodology.},

One can apply multiple algorithms to produce $N$ potentially different clustersings of the same objects, that is, partitions of the $n$ objects into $K$ groups. Even a single randomized algorithm can output different clusterings. This often happens when one samples from the posterior of a Bayesian model, or runs multiple {MCMC} chains from random initializations. A natural task is then to form a consensus among these different clusterings. The challenge in an unsupervised setting is that the optimal matching between clusters of different inputs is unknown. We model this problem as finding a barycenter (also known as Fr{\'e}chet mean) relative to the misclassification rate. We show that by lifting the problem to the space of association matrices, one can derive aggregation algorithms that circumvent the knowledge of the optimal matchings. We analyze the statistical performance of aggregation algorithms under a stochastic label perturbation model, and show that a $K$-means type algorithm followed by a local refinement step can achieve near optimal performance, with a rate that decays exponentially fast in $N$. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

To mitigate this, we propose Knowledge-exploited Auto-encoder for Protein ({KeAP}), which performs token-level knowledge graph exploration for protein representation learning. In practice, non-masked amino acids iteratively query the associated knowledge tokens to extract and integrate helpful information for restoring masked amino acids via attention. We show that {KeAP} can consistently outperform the previous counterpart on 9 representative downstream applications, sometimes surpassing it by large margins.

Uni-Mol contains two pretrained models with the same SE(3) Transformer architecture: a molecular model pretrained by 209M molecular conformations; a pocket model pretrained by 3M candidate protein pocket data. Besides, Uni-Mol contains several finetuning strategies to apply the pretrained models to various downstream tasks. Uni-Mol outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 14/15 molecular property prediction tasks and achieves superior performance in 3D spatial tasks, including protein-ligand binding pose prediction and molecular conformation generation.},

Regressions on dynamic graphs often contribute to diverse critical tasks, such as climate early-warning and traffic controlling. Existing homophily Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) adopt physical connections or feature similarity as adjacent matrix to perform node-level aggregations. However, on dynamic graphs with diverse node-wise relations, exploiting a pre-defined fixed topology for message passing inevitably leads to the aggregations of target-deviated neighbors. We designate such phenomenon as the topology-task discordance, which naturally challenges the homophily assumption. In this work, we revisit node-wise relationships and explore novel homophily measurements on dynamic graphs with both signs and distances, capturing multiple node-level spatial relations and temporal evolutions. We discover that advancing homophily aggregations to signed target-oriented message passing can effectively resolve the discordance and promote aggregation capacity. Therefore, a GReTo is proposed, which performs signed message passing in immediate neighborhood, and exploits both local environments and target awareness to realize high-order message propagation. Empirically, our solution achieves significant improvements against best baselines, notably improving 24.79\% on KnowAir and 3.60\% on Metr-LA.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning is a distributed paradigm that allows multiple parties to collaboratively train deep models without exchanging the raw data. However, the data distribution among clients is naturally non-i.i.d., which leads to severe degradation of the learnt model. The primary goal of this paper is to develop a robust federated learning algorithm to address feature shift in clients' samples, which can be caused by various factors, e.g., acquisition differences in medical imaging. To reach this goal, we propose {FedFA} to tackle federated learning from a distinct perspective of federated feature augmentation. {FedFA} is based on a major insight that each client's data distribution can be characterized by statistics (i.e., mean and standard deviation) of latent features; and it is likely to manipulate these local statistics globally, i.e., based on information in the entire federation, to let clients have a better sense of the underlying distribution and therefore alleviate local data bias. Based on this insight, we propose to augment each local feature statistic probabilistically based on a normal distribution, whose mean is the original statistic and variance quantifies the augmentation scope. Key to our approach is the determination of a meaningful Gaussian variance, which is accomplished by taking into account not only biased data of each individual client, but also underlying feature statistics characterized by all participating clients. We offer both theoretical and empirical justifications to verify the effectiveness of {FedFA}.},

In practice, MRM reconstructs masked image patches and masked report tokens following a multi-task scheme to learn knowledge-enhanced semantic representations. With MRM pre-training, we obtain pre-trained models that can be well transferred to various radiography tasks. Specifically, we find that MRM offers superior performance in label-efficient fine-tuning. For instance, MRM achieves 88.5\% mean AUC on CheXpert using 1\% labeled data, outperforming previous R$^2$L methods with 100\% labels. On NIH ChestX-ray, MRM outperforms the best performing counterpart by about 3\% under small labeling ratios. Besides, MRM surpasses self- and report-supervised pre-training in identifying the pneumonia type and the pneumothorax area, sometimes by large margins.},

  abstract     = {It's a meaningful and attractive topic to build a general and inclusive segmentation model that can recognize more categories in various scenarios. A straightforward way is to combine the existing fragmented segmentation datasets and train a multi-dataset network. However, there are two major issues with multi-dataset segmentation: (i) the inconsistent taxonomy demands manual reconciliation to construct a unified taxonomy; (ii) the inflexible one-hot common taxonomy causes time-consuming model retraining and defective supervision of unlabeled categories. In this paper, we investigate the multi-dataset segmentation and propose a scalable Language-guided Multi-dataset Segmentation framework, dubbed {LMSeg}, which supports both semantic and panoptic segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a pretrained text encoder to map the category names to a text embedding space as a unified taxonomy, instead of using inflexible one-hot label. The model dynamically aligns the segment queries with the category embeddings. Instead of relabeling each dataset with the unified taxonomy, a category-guided decoding module is designed to dynamically guide predictions to each dataset's taxonomy. Furthermore, we adopt a dataset-aware augmentation strategy that assigns each dataset a specific image augmentation pipeline, which can suit the properties of images from different datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements on four segmentation datasets and three panoptic datasets, while the ablation study evaluates the effectiveness of each component.},

For the first time, we show that training on a small number of key tasks beats using all the training tasks, while removing these key tasks substantially hurts performance. We also find that these key tasks are mostly question answering (QA) tasks. These novel findings combined deepen our understanding about zero-shot generalization---training on certain tasks such as QA encodes general knowledge transferable to a wide range of tasks. In addition, to automate this procedure, we devise a method that (1) identifies key training tasks without observing the test tasks by examining the pairwise generalization results and (2) resamples training tasks for better data distribution.

  abstract     = {By conditioning on natural language instructions, large language models (LLMs) have displayed impressive capabilities as general-purpose computers. However, task performance depends significantly on the quality of the prompt used to steer the model, and most effective prompts have been handcrafted by humans. Motivated by the idea of programming languages, we introduce Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE), a framework for automatic instruction generation and selection. In APE, we treat the instruction as the ``program,'' optimized by searching over a pool of instruction candidates proposed by an LLM to maximize a chosen score function. To evaluate an instruction's quality, we follow the instruction to generate outputs on a set of training examples, then compute execution accuracy relative to a set of human-annotated few-shot examples. Experiments on 24 NLP tasks show that our automatically generated instructions outperform the prior LLM baseline by a large margin and achieve better or comparable performance to human-generated instructions on 21/24 tasks. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses to understand how APE approaches the problem, including an analysis of the generated instructions and their relationships to human-written ones. We show that APE-engineered prompts can be applied in other settings, such as steering models toward truthfulness and/or informativeness, as well as to improve few-shot learning performance by simply prepending them to standard in-context learning prompts.},

  abstract     = {Chain-of-thought prompting has demonstrated remarkable performance on various natural language reasoning tasks. However, it tends to perform poorly on tasks which requires solving problems harder than the exemplars shown in the prompts. To overcome this challenge of easy-to-hard generalization, we propose a novel prompting strategy, least-to-most prompting. The key idea in this strategy is to break down a complex problem into a series of simpler subproblems and then solve them in sequence. Solving each subproblem is facilitated by the answers to previously solved subproblems. Our experimental results on tasks related to symbolic manipulation, compositional generalization, and math reasoning reveal that least-to-most prompting is capable of generalizing to more difficult problems than those seen in the prompts. A notable finding is that when the GPT-3 code-davinci-002 model is used with least-to-most prompting, it can solve the compositional generalization benchmark SCAN in any split (including length split) with an accuracy of at least 99\% using just 14 exemplars, compared to only 16\% accuracy with chain-of-thought prompting. This is particularly noteworthy because neural-symbolic models in the literature that specialize in solving SCAN are trained on the entire training set containing over 15,000 examples.},

Taking AdamW and Adam as examples, per iteration, we construct a dynamical loss that combines the vanilla training loss and a dynamic regularizer inspired by proximal point method, and respectively minimize the first- and second-order Taylor approximations of dynamical loss to update variable. This yields our Win acceleration that uses a conservative step and an aggressive step to update, and linearly combines these two updates for acceleration. Next, we extend Win into Win2 which uses multiple aggressive update steps for faster convergence. We show that Win can accelerate AdamW/Adam/LAMB/SGD by 1.5$\times$ and addresses the computational challenges of training deep networks on large-scale datasets. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that Win enjoys better convergence properties compared to baseline optimizers.

The former offers an energy-efficient and event-driven paradigm for deep learning, while the latter has the ability to capture feature dependencies, enabling Transformer to achieve good performance. It is intuitively promising to explore the marriage between them. In this paper, we consider leveraging both self-attention capability and biological properties of SNNs, and propose a novel Spiking Self Attention (SSA) as well as a powerful framework, named Spiking Transformer (Spikformer). The SSA mechanism in Spikformer models the sparse visual feature by using spike-form Query, Key, and Value without softmax. Since its computation is sparse and avoids multiplication, SSA is efficient and has low computational energy consumption. It is shown that Spikformer with SSA can outperform the state-of-the-art SNNs-like frameworks in image classification on both neuromorphic and static datasets. Spikformer (66.3M parameters) with comparable size to SEW-ResNet-152 (60.2M, 69.26\%) can achieve 74.81\% top1 accuracy on ImageNet using 4 time steps, which is the state-of-the-art in directly trained SNNs models.},

A key desideratum in conditional synthesis is to achieve high correspondence between the conditioning input and generated output. Most existing methods learn such relationships implicitly, by incorporating the prior into the variational lower bound. In this work, we take a different route -- we explicitly enhance input-output connections by maximizing their mutual information. To this end, we introduce a Conditional Discrete Contrastive Diffusion (CDCD) loss and design two contrastive diffusion mechanisms to effectively incorporate it into the denoising process, combining the diffusion training and contrastive learning for the first time by connecting it with the conventional variational objectives. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in evaluations with diverse multimodal conditional synthesis tasks: dance-to-music generation, text-to-image synthesis, as well as class-conditioned image synthesis. On each, we enhance the input-output correspondence and achieve higher or competitive general synthesis quality. Furthermore, the proposed approach improves the convergence of diffusion models, reducing the number of required diffusion steps by more than 35\% on two benchmarks, significantly increasing the inference speed.},

In this work, we propose a new data-driven setup for offline MORL, where we wish to learn a preference-agnostic policy agent using only a finite dataset of offline demonstrations of other agents and their preferences. The key contributions of this work are two-fold. First, we introduce D4MORL, (D)atasets for MORL that are specifically designed for offline settings. It contains 1.8 million annotated demonstrations obtained by rolling out reference policies that optimize for randomly sampled preferences on 6 MuJoCo environments with 2-3 objectives each. Second, we propose Pareto-Efficient Decision Agents (PEDA), a family of offline MORL algorithms that builds and extends Decision Transformers via a novel preference-and-return-conditioned policy. Empirically, we show that PEDA closely approximates the behavioral policy on the D4MORL benchmark and provides an excellent approximation of the Pareto-front with appropriate conditioning, as measured by the hypervolume and sparsity metrics.},

In this paper, we notice that the class weights of categories that tend to share many adjacent boundary pixels lack discrimination, thereby limiting the performance. We call this issue Boundary-caused Class Weights Confusion (BCWC). We try to focus on this problem and propose a novel method named Embedded Conditional Random Field (E-CRF) to alleviate it. E-CRF innovatively fuses the CRF into the CNN network as an organic whole for more effective end-to-end optimization. The reasons are two folds. It utilizes CRF to guide the message passing between pixels in high-level features to purify the feature representation of boundary pixels, with the help of inner pixels belonging to the same object. More importantly, it enables optimizing class weights from both scale and direction during backpropagation. We make detailed theoretical analysis to prove it. Besides, superpixel is integrated into E-CRF and served as an auxiliary to exploit the local object prior for more reliable message passing. Finally, our proposed method yields impressive results on ADE20K, Cityscapes, and Pascal Context datasets.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods are typically applied directly in environments to learn policies. In some complex environments with continuous state-action spaces, sparse rewards, and/or long temporal horizons, learning a good policy in the original environments can be difficult. Focusing on the offline RL setting, we aim to build a simple and discrete world model that abstracts the original environment. RL methods are applied to our world model instead of the environment data for simplified policy learning. Our world model, dubbed Value Memory Graph (VMG), is designed as a directed-graph-based Markov decision process (MDP) of which vertices and directed edges represent graph states and graph actions, separately. As state-action spaces of VMG are finite and relatively small compared to the original environment, we can directly apply the value iteration algorithm on VMG to estimate graph state values and figure out the best graph actions. VMG is trained from and built on the offline RL dataset. Together with an action translator that converts the abstract graph actions in VMG to real actions in the original environment, VMG controls agents to maximize episode returns. Our experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that VMG can outperform state-of-the-art offline RL methods in several tasks, especially when environments have sparse rewards and long temporal horizons.},

  abstract     = {As graph data size increases, the vast latency and memory consumption during inference pose a significant challenge to the real-world deployment of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While quantization is a powerful approach to reducing GNNs complexity, most previous works on GNNs quantization fail to exploit the unique characteristics of GNNs, suffering from severe accuracy degradation. Through an in-depth analysis of the topology of GNNs, we observe that the topology of the graph leads to significant differences between nodes, and most of the nodes in a graph appear to have a small aggregation value. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose the Aggregation-Aware mixed-precision Quantization (A²Q) for GNNs, where an appropriate bitwidth is automatically learned and assigned to each node in the graph. To mitigate the vanishing gradient problem caused by sparse connections between nodes, we propose a Local Gradient method to serve the quantization error of the node features as the supervision during training. We also develop a Nearest Neighbor Strategy to deal with the generalization on unseen graphs. Extensive experiments on eight public node-level and graph-level datasets demonstrate the generality and robustness of our proposed method. Compared to the FP32 models, our method can achieve up to 18.8× (i.e., 1.70bits) compression ratio with negligible accuracy degradation. Moreover, compared to the state-of-the-art quantization method, our method can achieve up to 11.4\% and 9.5\% accuracy improvements on the node-level and graph-level tasks, respectively, and up to 2× speedup on a dedicated hardware accelerator.},

  abstract     = {By properly utilizing the learned environment model, model-based reinforcement learning methods can improve the sample efficiency for decision-making problems. Beyond using the learned environment model to train a policy, the success of MCTS-based methods shows that directly incorporating the learned environment model as a planner to make decisions might be more effective. However, when action space is of high dimension and continuous, directly planning according to the learned model is costly and non-trivial. Because of two challenges: (1) the infinite number of candidate actions and (2) the temporal dependency between actions in different timesteps. To address these challenges, inspired by Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) in optimal control theory, we design a novel Policy Optimization with Model Planning (POMP) algorithm, which incorporates a carefully designed Deep Differential Dynamic Programming (D3P) planner into the model-based RL framework. In D3P planner, (1) to effectively plan in the continuous action space, we construct a locally quadratic programming problem that uses a gradient-based optimization process to replace search. (2) To take the temporal dependency of actions at different timesteps into account, we leverage the updated and latest actions of previous timesteps (i.e., step $1, \cdots, h-1$) to update the action of the current step (i.e., step $h$), instead of updating all actions simultaneously. We theoretically prove the convergence rate for our D3P planner and analyze the effect of the feedback term. In practice, to effectively apply the neural network based D3P planner in reinforcement learning, we leverage the policy network to initialize the action sequence and keep the action update conservative in the planning process. Experiments demonstrate that POMP consistently improves sample efficiency on widely used continuous control tasks.},

Empirically, 𝒪-GNN shows good performance on 11 public datasets, achieving state-of-the-art validation result on the PCQM4Mv1 benchmark (outperforming the previous KDDCup champion solution) and drug-drug interaction prediction task on DrugBank.

To deal with this problem, we propose a novel framework called Slack Federated Adversarial Training (SFAT), assigning the client-wise slack during aggregation to combat the intensified heterogeneity. Theoretically, we analyze the convergence of the proposed method to properly relax the objective when combining federated learning and adversarial training. Empirically, we verify the rationality and effectiveness of SFAT on various benchmarked and real-world datasets with different adversarial training and federated optimization methods.},

The multi-source setting further prevents the transfer task as excessive domain gap introduced from all the source domains. To tackle this problem, we newly propose a progressive mix-up (P-Mixup) mechanism to introduce an intermediate mix-up domain, pushing both the source domains and the few-shot target domain aligned to this mix-up domain. Further by enforcing the mix-up domain to progressively move towards the source domains, we achieve the domain transfer from multi-source domains to the single one-shot target domain.},

We extend the formulation of diffusion probabilistic models to deal with this field parametrization in an explicit way, enabling us to define and end-to-end learning algorithm that side-steps the requirement of representing fields with latent vectors as in previous approaches.},

  abstract     = {Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is a challenging setting where existing off-policy actor-critic methods perform poorly due to overestimating of out-of-distribution state-action pairs. Thus, various additional augmentations are proposed to keep the learned policy close to the offline dataset (or the behavior policy). Starting from the analysis of offline monotonic policy improvement, we reach a surprising conclusion that online on-policy algorithms are naturally able to solve offline RL. Specifically, the inherent conservatism of these on-policy algorithms is exactly what the offline RL method needs to overcome the overestimation. Based on this, we propose Behavior Proximal Policy Optimization (BPPO), which solves offline RL without any extra constraint or regularization introduced compared to PPO. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark empirically show this extremely succinct method outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a variety of methods under the name of non-contrastive learning (like BYOL, SimSiam, SwAV, DINO) show that when equipped with some asymmetric architectural designs, aligning positive pairs alone is sufficient to attain good performance in self-supervised visual learning. Despite some understandings of some specific modules (like the predictor in BYOL), there is yet no unified theoretical understanding of how these seemingly different asymmetric designs can all avoid feature collapse, particularly considering methods that also work without the predictor (like DINO). In this paper, we introduce a general theoretical framework called Rank Differential Mechanism (RDM) that can provide a unified understanding of existing non-contrastive learning methods. The RDM theory shows that all these asymmetric designs create a consistent rank difference in their dual-branch output features. Different from previous theories, the RDM theory is applicable to different asymmetric designs (with and without the predictor), and thus can serve as a unified understanding of existing non-contrastive learning methods. The RDM theory also provides practical guidelines for designing many new non-contrastive variants. These variants indeed achieve comparable performance to existing methods on benchmark datasets, and some of them even outperform the baselines.},

(2020) and Le & Hua (2021) demonstrated the importance of learning rate schedules during retraining for Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP). We show that the retraining phase can be massively shortened using a simple linear learning rate schedule and propose a method to adaptively select the initial value of this linear schedule. Additionally, we show that imposing a budget on the initial dense training phase results in a simple method that can outperform more complex state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings challenge the belief that one should avoid retraining and question approaches that incorporate sparsification into standard training.},

  abstract     = {Self-supervised learning methods map different augmentations of the same image to the same feature representation, where data augmentations are crucial for the quality of learned features. We analyze how traditional color jitter used in data augmentation negatively impacts the quality of color features in learned representations. To address this problem, we propose a more realistic, physics-based color data augmentation called Planckian Jitter that creates realistic variations in chromaticity and produces a model robust to illumination changes commonly observed in real life, while maintaining the ability to discriminate image content based on color information. The key difference is that Planckian jitter transforms colors along chromaticity lines that occur in nature when changing the illuminant, whereas default color jitter transfers colors throughout the whole chromaticity plane. Experiments confirm that representations learned with Planckian Jitter are complementary to those learned with current color jitter augmentation, and simple concatenation leads to significant performance gains on a wide range of downstream datasets. We also present a color sensitivity analysis documenting the impact of different training methods on model neurons and show that learned features are robust with respect to illuminant variations.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge distillation (KD) has shown very promising capabilities in transferring learning representations from large models (teachers) to small models (students). However, as the capacity gap between students and teachers becomes larger, existing KD methods fail to achieve better results. We show that the 'prior knowledge' is vital to KD, especially when applying large teachers. Particularly, we propose the dynamic prior knowledge (DPK), which integrates part of teacher's features as the prior knowledge before the feature distillation. This means our method also takes the teacher's feature as 'input', not just 'target'. Besides, we dynamically adjust the ratio of the prior knowledge during the training phase according to the feature gap, thus guiding the student in an appropriate difficulty. To evaluate the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on two image classification benchmarks (i.e. CIFAR100 and ImageNet) and an object detection benchmark (i.e. MS COCO).},

  abstract     = {A multitude of work has shown that machine learning-based medical diagnosis systems can be biased against certain subgroups of people. This has motivated a growing number of bias mitigation algorithms that aim to address fairness issues in machine learning. However, it is difficult to compare their effectiveness in medical imaging for two reasons. First, there is little consensus on the criteria to assess fairness. Second, existing bias mitigation algorithms are developed under different settings, e.g., datasets, model selection strategies, backbones, and fairness metrics, making a direct comparison and evaluation based on existing results impossible. In this work, we introduce MEDFAIR, a framework to benchmark the fairness of machine learning models for medical imaging. MEDFAIR covers eleven algorithms from various categories, nine datasets from different imaging modalities, and three model selection criteria. Through extensive experiments, we find that the under-studied issue of model selection criterion can have a significant impact on fairness outcomes; while in contrast, state-of-the-art bias mitigation algorithms do not significantly improve fairness outcomes over empirical risk minimization (ERM) in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. We evaluate fairness from various perspectives and make recommendations for different medical application scenarios that require different ethical principles. Our framework provides a reproducible and easy-to-use entry point for the development and evaluation of future bias mitigation algorithms in deep learning.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive gradient methods such as Adam have gained increasing popularity in deep learning optimization. However, it has been observed that compared with (stochastic) gradient descent, Adam can converge to a different solution with a significantly worse test error in many deep learning applications such as image classification, even with a fine-tuned regularization. In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon: we show that in the nonconvex setting of learning over-parameterized two-layer convolutional neural networks starting from the same random initialization, for a class of data distributions (inspired from image data), Adam and gradient descent (GD) can converge to different global solutions of the training objective with provably different generalization errors, even with weight decay regularization. In contrast, we show that if the training objective is convex, and the weight decay regularization is employed, any optimization algorithms including Adam and GD will converge to the same solution if the training is successful. This suggests that the generalization gap between Adam and SGD in the presence of weight decay regularization is closely tied to the nonconvex landscape of deep learning optimization, which cannot be covered by the recent neural tangent kernel (NTK) based analysis.},

In many recent works such as NeRF, the scene geometry is parameterized using neural implicit representations (i.e., MLPs). Implicit neural representations have achieved impressive visual quality but have drawbacks in computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a new approach that performs view synthesis using point clouds. It is the first point-based method that achieves better visual quality than NeRF while being 100x faster in rendering speed. Our approach builds on existing works on differentiable point-based rendering but introduces a novel technique we call Sculpted Neural Points (SNP), which significantly improves the robustness to errors and holes in the reconstructed point cloud.},

  abstract     = {The goal of meta-learning is to learn a good prior model from a collection of tasks such that the learned prior is able to adapt quickly to new tasks without accessing many data from the new tasks. A common practice in meta-learning is to perform a train-validation split on each task, where the training set is used for adapting the model parameter to that specific task and the validation set is used for learning a prior model that is shared across all tasks. Despite its success and popularity in multitask learning and few-shot learning, the understanding of the train-validation split is still limited, especially when the neural network models are used. In this paper, we study the benefit of train-validation split for classification problems with neural network models trained by gradient descent. We prove that the train-validation split is necessary to learn a good prior model when the noise in the training sample is large, while the train-train method fails. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work towards the theoretical understanding of train-validation split in meta-learning with neural networks.},
