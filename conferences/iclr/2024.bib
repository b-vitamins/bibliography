  abstract     = {Adversarial training improves the robustness of neural networks against adversarial attacks, albeit at the expense of the trade-off between standard and robust generalization. To unveil the underlying factors driving this phenomenon, we examine the layer-wise learning capabilities of neural networks during the transition from a standard to an adversarial setting. Our analysis reveals that during adversarial training, the learning in the lower layers is limited due to the upper layers' fast adaptation to adversarial perturbations, resulting in a seesaw effect that inhibits the model from learning robust and generalizable features. To address this limitation, we introduce Conserve-Update-Revise ({CUR}), a training framework that enables robust and generalizable feature learning in adversarially trained models. {CUR} divides adversarial training into three distinct phases: conserve to preserve critical features, update to selectively enhance robustness, and revise to improve generalization. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate {CUR}'s effectiveness in mitigating the robustness-generalization trade-off while simultaneously reducing robust overfitting.},

  abstract = {Machine unlearning aims to remove information derived from forgotten data while preserving that of the remaining dataset in a well-trained model. With the increasing emphasis on data privacy, several approaches to machine unlearning have emerged. However, these methods typically rely on complete supervision throughout the unlearning process. Unfortunately, obtaining such supervision, whether for the forgetting or remaining data, can be impractical due to the substantial cost associated with annotating real-world datasets. In this work, we propose a supervision-free unlearning approach that operates without the need for labels during the unlearning process. We introduce a variational approach to approximate the distribution of representations for the remaining data. Leveraging this approximation, we adapt the original model to eliminate information from the forgotten data at the representation level. To further address the issue of lacking supervision information, we introduce a contrastive loss to facilitate the matching of representations between the remaining data and those of the original model, thus preserving predictive performance. Experimental results across various unlearning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method without using any labels, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods that rely on full supervision information.},

  abstract = {Multi-agent path finding ({MAPF}) is the combinatorial problem of planning optimal collision-avoiding paths for multiple agents, with application to robotics, logistics, and transportation. Though many recent learning-based works have focused on large-scale combinatorial problems by guiding their decomposition into sequences of smaller subproblems, the combined spatiotemporal and time-restricted nature of {MAPF} poses a particular challenge for learning-based guidance of iterative approaches like large neighborhood search ({LNS}), which is already a state-of-the-art approach for {MAPF} even without learning. We address this challenge of neural-guided {LNS} for {MAPF} by designing an architecture which interleaves convolution and attention to efficiently represent {MAPF} subproblems, enabling practical guidance of {LNS} in benchmark settings. We demonstrate the speedup of our method over existing state-of-the-art {LNS}-based methods for {MAPF} as well as the robustness of our method to unseen settings. Our proposed method expands the horizon of effective deep learning-guided {LNS} methods into multi-path planning problems, and our proposed representation may be more broadly applicable for representing path-wise interactions.},

@inproceedings{chen2024less,
  abstract = {Image attribution algorithms aim to identify important regions that are highly relevant to model decisions. Although existing attribution solutions can effectively assign importance to target elements, they still face the following challenges: 1) existing attribution methods generate inaccurate small regions thus misleading the direction of correct attribution, and 2) the model cannot produce good attribution results for samples with wrong predictions. In this work, we model the image attribution problem as a submodular subset selection problem. We propose a novel submodular function that can discover accurate small interpretation regions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to model attribution as a submodular optimization problem. Furthermore, we impose four constraints that consider the effectiveness, confidence, consistency, and collaboration scores of sub-regions to select interpretable regions. This paper provides theoretical analysis to substantiate that our formulation is indeed submodular. Extensive experiments and comparisons with existing attribution algorithms demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.},

However, these models often exhibit biases across different demographic groups, which can lead to disparities in medical diagnosis and treatment. Currently, no fairness datasets are available for medical image segmentation, which limits the development and evaluation of fair medical {AI} algorithms. To address this gap, we propose {Harvard-FairSeg}, the first fairness dataset for medical segmentation with 10,000 subject samples. We utilize the segment anything model ({SAM}) to generate initial segmentation masks and employ a fair error-bound scaling approach to reweight the loss function, using the upper error-bound in each identity group. We evaluate our approach across multiple segmentation metrics and propose equity-scaled segmentation performance metrics for fair comparisons. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our fair error-bound scaling approach either has superior or comparable fairness performance to the state-of-the-art fairness learning models.},

However, such over-specialized model designs incur redundant parameters, thus limiting the broader applicability of {3D} {SOT} task. This paper first introduces unified models that can simultaneously track objects across all categories using a single network with shared model parameters. Specifically, we propose to explicitly encode distinct attributes associated to different object categories, enabling the model to adapt to cross-category data. We develop {A}da{F}ormer, a novel point set representation learning network that adaptively encodes the dynamically varying shape and size information from cross-category data in a unified manner. Additionally, we incorporate the size and shape prior derived from the known template targets into the model's inputs and learning objective, facilitating the learning of unified representation. Equipped with such designs, we construct two category-unified models {S}iam{CUT} and {M}o{CUT}. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our models exhibit strong generalization and training stability.

Previous dynamic scene reconstruction works either attempt to model the motion of {3D} points in space, or assume knowledge of the object priors and only track the deformation parameters, which limits them to handle a single articulated object or require depth maps as input. By contrast, we propose to directly estimate the change of the {S}igned {D}istance {F}unction ({SDF}), namely {SDF} flow, of the dynamic scene. We show that the {SDF} flow captures the evolution of the scene surface and derives the mathematical relation between the {SDF} flow and the scene flow, which allows us to compute the scene flow analytically from the {SDF} flow. Given multi-view images, we train a neural network to learn the {SDF} and the {SDF} flow of the dynamic scene. Our experiments on real-world multi-view video datasets show that our method can reconstruct dynamic scenes with higher quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

We revisit classic algorithms in this space and introduce a new {IRL} algorithm called {R}eceding {H}orizon {I}nverse {P}lanning ({RHIP}) that provides fine-grained control over performance trade-offs. The techniques we introduce are based on graph compression, spatial parallelization, and improved initialization conditions inspired by a connection to eigenvector algorithms. We test our approach on a real-world dataset of de-identified Google Maps driving trajectories. Our final {RHIP} policy achieves a 16--24\% relative improvement in global route match rate, i.e., the percentage of de-identified travelled routes that exactly match the suggested route. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the largest instance of {IRL} in a real world setting to date.},

A recent line of research exploits Bayesian inference with informative priors to handle the ill-posedness of such problems. Amongst such priors, score-based generative models (SGM) have recently been successfully applied to several different inverse problems. In this study, we exploit the particular structure of the prior defined by the SGM to define a sequence of intermediate linear inverse problems. As the noise level decreases, the posteriors of these inverse problems get closer to the target posterior of the original inverse problem. To sample from this sequence of posteriors, we propose the use of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods.},

One notable concern about MLM is that the special [MASK] symbol causes a discrepancy between pretraining data and downstream data as it is present only in pretraining but not in fine-tuning. The authors demonstrate that MLM pretraining allocates some model dimensions exclusively for representing [MASK] tokens, resulting in a representation deficiency for real tokens. They propose MAE-LM, which pretrains the Masked Autoencoder architecture with MLM where [MASK] tokens are excluded from the encoder.},

To achieve high-quality results with low computational cost, we present a novel pixel spread model (PSM) that iteratively employs decoupled probabilistic modeling, combining the optimization efficiency of GANs with the prediction tractability of probabilistic models. As a result, our model selectively spreads informative pixels throughout the image in a few iterations, largely enhancing the completion quality and efficiency.

The approach trains a parametrized prior learner given visual observations to approximate the visual posterior of inverse graphics, using a learned neural renderer to obtain particle states.

  abstract = {We study risk-sensitive Reinforcement Learning (RL), where we aim to maximize the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) with a fixed risk tolerance $\tau$. Prior theoretical work studying risk-sensitive RL focuses on the tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) setting. To extend CVaR RL to settings where state space is large, function approximation must be deployed. We study CVaR RL in low-rank MDPs with nonlinear function approximation. Low-rank MDPs assume the underlying transition kernel admits a low-rank decomposition, but unlike prior linear models, low-rank MDPs do not assume the feature or state-action representation is known. We propose a novel Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) bonus-driven algorithm to carefully balance the interplay between exploration, exploitation, and representation learning in CVaR RL. We prove that our algorithm achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{H^7 A^2 d^4}{\tau^2 \epsilon^2}\right)$ to yield an $\epsilon$-optimal CVaR, where $H$ is the length of each episode, $A$ is the capacity of action space, and $d$ is the dimension of representations. Computational-wise, we design a novel discretized Least-Squares Value Iteration (LSVI) algorithm for the CVaR objective as the planning oracle and show that we can find the near-optimal policy in a polynomial running time with a Maximum Likelihood Estimation oracle. To our knowledge, this is the first provably efficient CVaR RL algorithm in low-rank MDPs.},

  abstract = {Improving the alignment of language models with human preferences remains an active research challenge. Recently, offline methods such as Sequence Likelihood Calibration (SLiC) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have emerged as attractive alternatives, offering improvements in stability and scalability while maintaining competitive performance. SLiC refines its loss function using sequence pairs sampled from a supervised fine-tuned (SFT) policy, while DPO directly optimizes language models based on preference data, foregoing the need for a separate reward model. However, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the target optimal policy requires labeled preference pairs sampled from that policy. The absence of a reward model in DPO constrains its ability to sample preference pairs from the optimal policy. To address this limitation, we propose Statistical Rejection Sampling Optimization (RSO), which uses rejection sampling to collect preference data from the optimal policy. Our approach improves policy estimation over DPO and SLiC by ensuring that preference pairs are sampled from the estimated optimal policy rather than from unknown or suboptimal distributions.},

  abstract = {Table-based reasoning with large language models (LLMs) is a promising direction to tackle many table understanding tasks, such as table-based question answering and fact verification. Compared with generic reasoning, table-based reasoning requires the extraction of underlying semantics from both free-form questions and semi-structured tabular data. Chain-of-Thought and its similar approaches incorporate the reasoning chain in the form of textual context, but it is still an open question how to effectively leverage tabular data in the reasoning chain. We propose the Chain-of-Table framework, where tabular data is explicitly used in the reasoning chain as a proxy for intermediate thoughts. Specifically, we guide LLMs using in-context learning to iteratively generate operations and update the table to represent a tabular reasoning chain. LLMs can therefore dynamically plan the next operation based on the results of the previous ones. This continuous evolution of the table forms a chain, showing the reasoning process for a given tabular problem. The chain carries structured information of the intermediate results, enabling more accurate and reliable predictions. Chain-of-Table achieves new state-of-the-art performance on WikiTQ, FeTaQA, and TabFact benchmarks across multiple LLM choices.},

However, these approaches are either bounded by the policy planning capability of the frozen LLMs or hard to be transferred to new cases. In this work, we introduce a new dialogue policy planning paradigm to strategize LLMs for proactive dialogue problems with a tunable language model plug-in as a plug-and-play dialogue policy planner, named PPDPP. Specifically, we develop a novel training framework to facilitate supervised fine-tuning over available human-annotated data as well as reinforcement learning from goal-oriented AI feedback with dynamic interaction data collected by the LLM-based self-play simulation. The self-play paradigm prompts two LLMs to perform role-playing conversation that simulates the dynamic environment of multi-turn interactions between the dialogue agent and the real user. A third LLM acts as the reward model to provide goal-oriented verbal feedback for reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across three different applications of proactive dialogues demonstrate that PPDPP consistently and substantially outperforms existing approaches.},

  abstract = {The ever-increasing large language models (LLMs), though opening a potential path for the upcoming artificial general intelligence, sadly drops a daunting obstacle on the way towards their on-device deployment. As one of the most well-established pre-LLMs approaches in reducing model complexity, network pruning appears to lag behind in the era of LLMs, due mostly to its costly fine-tuning (or re-training) necessity under the massive volumes of model parameter and training data. To close this industry-academia gap, we introduce Dynamic Sparse No Training (DSNT), a training-free fine-tuning approach that slightly updates sparse LLMs without the expensive backpropagation and any weight updates. Inspired by the Dynamic Sparse Training, DSNT minimizes the reconstruction error between the dense and sparse LLMs, in the fashion of performing iterative weight pruning-and-growing on top of sparse LLMs. To accomplish this purpose, DSNT particularly takes into account the anticipated reduction in reconstruction error for pruning and growing, as well as the variance w.r.t. different input data for growing each weight. This practice can be executed efficiently in linear time since its obviates the need of backpropagation for fine-tuning LLMs. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-V1/V2, Vicuna, and OPT across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of DSNT in enhancing the performance of sparse LLMs, especially at high sparsity levels. For instance, DSNT is able to outperform the state-of-the-art Wanda by 26.79 perplexity at 70\% sparsity with LLaMA-7B.},

Existing approaches effectively constrained the representation difference by a margin to fit similarity supervision, but can hardly restrict the variation of representation difference, sometimes leading to overfitting results where the clusters are disordered by drastically changed differences. In this work, we propose a novel difference alignment regularization to encourage all representation differences between inter-class instances to be as close as possible, so that the learning algorithm can produce consistent differences to distinguish data points from each other. We construct a new cross-total-variation (CTV) norm to measure the divergence among representation differences, and convert it into an equivalent stochastic form for easy optimization. The regularizer is integrated into the empirical loss for difference-aligned similarity learning (DASL), shrinking the hypothesis space and alleviating overfitting. Theoretically, we prove that our regularizer tightens the error bound of the traditional similarity learning. Empirically, experiments demonstrate the superiority of DASL over existing approaches in both supervised metric learning and unsupervised contrastive learning tasks.},

However, COMBINER still has significant limitations: 1) it uses factorized priors and posterior approximations that lack flexibility; 2) it cannot effectively adapt to local deviations from global patterns in the data; and 3) its performance can be susceptible to modeling choices and the variational parameters' initializations. Our proposed method, Robust and Enhanced COMBINER (RECOMBINER), addresses these issues by 1) enriching the variational approximation while retaining a low computational cost via a linear reparameterization of the INR weights, 2) augmenting our INRs with learnable positional encodings that enable them to adapt to local details and 3) splitting high-resolution data into patches to increase robustness and utilizing expressive hierarchical priors to capture dependency across patches. We conduct extensive experiments across several data modalities, showcasing that RECOMBINER achieves competitive results with the best INR-based methods and even outperforms autoencoder-based codecs on low-resolution images at low bitrates.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in open-ended text generation tasks. However, the inherent open-ended nature of these tasks implies that there is always room for improvement in the quality of model responses. To address this challenge, various approaches have been proposed to enhance the performance of LLMs. There has been a growing focus on enabling LLMs to self-improve their response quality, thereby reducing the reliance on extensive human annotation efforts for collecting diverse and high-quality training data. Recently, prompting-based methods have been widely explored among self-improvement methods owing to their effectiveness, efficiency, and convenience. However, those methods usually require explicitly and thoroughly written rubrics as inputs to LLMs. It is expensive and challenging to manually derive and provide all necessary rubrics with a real-world complex goal for improvement (e.g., being more helpfulness and less harmful). To this end, we propose an imPlicit self-ImprovemenT (PIT) framework that implicitly learns the improvement goal from human preference data. PIT only requires preference data that are used to train reward models with no extra human efforts. Specifically, we reformulate the training objective of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- instead of maximizing response quality for a given input, we maximize the quality gap of the response conditioned on a reference response. In this way, PIT is implicitly trained with the improvement goal of better aligning with human preferences. Experiments on two real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset show that our method significantly outperforms prompting-based methods.},

As a consequence of posterior collapse, the latent variables extracted by the encoder in VAE preserve less information from the input data and thus fail to produce meaningful representations as input to the reconstruction process in the decoder. While this phenomenon has been an actively addressed topic related to VAE performance, the theory for posterior collapse remains underdeveloped, especially beyond the standard VAE. In this work, we advance the theoretical understanding of posterior collapse to two important and prevalent yet less studied classes of VAE: conditional VAE and hierarchical VAE. Specifically, via a non-trivial theoretical analysis of linear conditional VAE and hierarchical VAE with two levels of latent, we prove that the cause of posterior collapses in these models includes the correlation between the input and output of the conditional VAE and the effect of learnable encoder variance in the hierarchical VAE. We empirically validate our theoretical findings for linear conditional and hierarchical VAE and demonstrate that these results are also predictive for non-linear cases with extensive experiments.},

In this paper, we introduce Utility-based Perturbed Gradient Descent (UPGD) as a novel approach for the continual learning of representations. UPGD combines gradient updates with perturbations, where it applies smaller modifications to more useful units, protecting them from forgetting, and larger modifications to less useful units, rejuvenating their plasticity. We use a challenging streaming learning setup where continual learning problems have hundreds of non-stationarities and unknown task boundaries. We show that many existing methods suffer from at least one of the issues, predominantly manifested by their decreasing accuracy over tasks. On the other hand, UPGD continues to improve performance and surpasses or is competitive with all methods in all problems. Finally, in extended reinforcement learning experiments with PPO, we show that while Adam exhibits a performance drop after initial learning, UPGD avoids it by addressing both continual learning issues.},

In existing samplers, the coefficients of the ODE solvers are pre-determined by the ODE formulation, the reverse discrete timesteps, and the employed ODE methods. In this paper, we consider accelerating several popular ODE-based sampling processes (including EDM, DDIM, and DPM-Solver) by optimizing certain coefficients via improved integration approximation (IIA). We propose to minimize, for each time step, a mean squared error (MSE) function with respect to the selected coefficients. The MSE is constructed by applying the original ODE solver for a set of fine-grained timesteps, which in principle provides a more accurate integration approximation in predicting the next diffusion state. The proposed IIA technique does not require any change of a pre-trained model, and only introduces a very small computational overhead for solving a number of quadratic optimization problems. Extensive experiments show that considerably better FID scores can be achieved by using IIA-EDM, IIA-DDIM, and IIA-DPM-Solver than the original counterparts when the neural function evaluation (NFE) is small (i.e., less than 25).},

  abstract = {Transformers have become the standard in state-of-the-art vision architectures, achieving impressive performance on both image-level and dense pixelwise tasks. However, training vision transformers for high-resolution pixelwise tasks has a prohibitive cost. Typical solutions boil down to hierarchical architectures, fast and approximate attention, or training on low-resolution crops. This latter solution does not constrain architectural choices, but it leads to a clear performance drop when testing at resolutions significantly higher than that used for training, thus requiring ad-hoc and slow post-processing schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for efficient training and inference of high-resolution vision transformers. The key principle is to mask out most of the high-resolution inputs during training, keeping only N random windows. This allows the model to learn local interactions between tokens inside each window, and global interactions between tokens from different windows. As a result, the model can directly process the high-resolution input at test time without any special trick. We show that this strategy is effective when using relative positional embedding such as rotary embeddings. It is 4 times faster to train than a full-resolution network, and it is straightforward to use at test time compared to existing approaches. We apply this strategy to three dense prediction tasks with high-resolution data. First, we show on the task of semantic segmentation that a simple setting with 2 windows performs best, hence the name of our method: Win-Win. Second, we confirm this result on the task of monocular depth prediction. Third, we further extend it to the binocular task of optical flow, reaching state-of-the-art performance on the Spring benchmark that contains Full-HD images with an order of magnitude faster inference than the best competitor.},

@inproceedings{chen2024going,
  abstract = {The behavior of neural networks still remains opaque, and a recently widely noted phenomenon is that networks often achieve similar performance when initialized with different random parameters. This phenomenon has attracted significant attention in measuring the similarity between features learned by distinct networks. However, feature similarity could be vague in describing the same feature since equivalent features hardly exist. In this paper, we expand the concept of equivalent feature and provide the definition of what we call functionally equivalent features. These features produce equivalent output under certain transformations. Using this definition, we aim to derive a more intrinsic metric for the so-called feature complexity regarding the redundancy of features learned by a neural network at each layer. We offer a formal interpretation of our approach through the lens of category theory, a well-developed area in mathematics. To quantify the feature complexity, we further propose an efficient algorithm named Iterative Feature Merging. Our experimental results validate our ideas and theories from various perspectives. We empirically demonstrate that the functionally equivalence widely exists among different features learned by the same neural network and we could reduce the number of parameters of the network without affecting the performance. The IFM shows great potential as a data-agnostic model prune method. We have also drawn several interesting empirical findings regarding the defined feature complexity.},

  abstract = {Matching cross-modality features between images and point clouds is a fundamental problem for image-to-point cloud registration. However, due to the modality difference between images and points, it is difficult to learn robust and discriminative cross-modality features by existing metric learning methods for feature matching. Instead of applying metric learning on cross-modality data, we propose to unify the modality between images and point clouds by pretrained large-scale models first, and then establish robust correspondence within the same modality. We show that the intermediate features, called diffusion features, extracted by depth-to-image diffusion models are semantically consistent between images and point clouds, which enables the building of coarse but robust cross-modality correspondences. We further extract geometric features on depth maps produced by the monocular depth estimator. By matching such geometric features, we significantly improve the accuracy of the coarse correspondences produced by diffusion features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that without any task-specific training, direct utilization of both features produces accurate image-to-point cloud registration. On three public indoor and outdoor benchmarks, the proposed method averagely achieves a 20.6 percent improvement in Inlier Ratio, a three-fold higher Inlier Number, and a 48.6 percent improvement in Registration Recall than existing state-of-the-arts.},

Existing approaches often suffer from excessive forgetting and imbalance of the scores assigned to classes that have not been seen together during training. In this study, we introduce a novel approach, Prediction Error-based Classification (PEC), which differs from traditional discriminative and generative classification paradigms. PEC computes a class score by measuring the prediction error of a model trained to replicate the outputs of a frozen random neural network on data from that class. The method can be interpreted as approximating a classification rule based on Gaussian Process posterior variance. PEC offers several practical advantages, including sample efficiency, ease of tuning, and effectiveness even when data are presented one class at a time. Our empirical results show that PEC performs strongly in single-pass-through-data CIL, outperforming other rehearsal-free baselines in all cases and rehearsal-based methods with moderate replay buffer size in most cases across multiple benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Time-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.},

To better understand this phenomenon, we investigate whether there are benefits of DG algorithms over ERM through the lens of label noise. Specifically, our finite-sample analysis reveals that label noise exacerbates the effect of spurious correlations for ERM, undermining generalization. Conversely, we illustrate that DG algorithms exhibit implicit label-noise robustness during finite-sample training even when spurious correlation is present. Such desirable property helps mitigate spurious correlations and improve generalization in synthetic experiments. However, additional comprehensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets indicate that label-noise robustness does not necessarily translate to better performance compared to ERM. We conjecture that the failure mode of ERM arising from spurious correlations may be less pronounced in practice.},

@inproceedings{zhang2024when,
  abstract = {While large language models (LLMs) often adopt finetuning to unlock their capabilities for downstream applications, our understanding on the inductive biases (especially the scaling properties) of different finetuning methods is still limited. To fill this gap, we conduct systematic experiments studying whether and how different scaling factors, including LLM model size, pretraining data size, new finetuning parameter size and finetuning data size, affect the finetuning performance. We consider two types of finetuning -- full-model tuning (FMT) and parameter efficient tuning (PET, including prompt tuning and LoRA), and explore their scaling behaviors in the data-limited regime where the LLM model size substantially outweighs the finetuning data size. Based on two sets of pretrained bilingual LLMs from 1B to 16B and experiments on bilingual machine translation and multilingual summarization benchmarks, we find that 1) LLM finetuning follows a power-based multiplicative joint scaling law between finetuning data size and each other scaling factor; 2) LLM finetuning benefits more from LLM model scaling than pretraining data scaling, and PET parameter scaling is generally ineffective; and 3) the optimal finetuning method is highly task- and finetuning data-dependent. We hope our findings could shed light on understanding, selecting and developing LLM finetuning methods.},

However, this image-captioning based training objective inherently biases the VPG to concentrate solely on the primary visual contents sufficient for caption generation, often neglecting other visual details. This shortcoming results in MLLMs' underperformance in comprehending demonstrative instructions consisting of multiple, interleaved, and multimodal instructions that demonstrate the required context to complete a task. The paper proposes VPG-C (Visual Prompt Generator Complete) to address these limitations. Further, we propose a synthetic discriminative training strategy to fine-tune VPG-C, eliminating the need for supervised demonstrative instructions. As for evaluation, we build DEMON, a comprehensive benchmark for demonstrative instruction understanding. Synthetically trained with the proposed strategy, VPG-C achieves significantly stronger zero-shot performance across all tasks of DEMON. Further evaluation on the MME and OwlEval benchmarks also demonstrate the superiority of VPG-C.},

  abstract = {GNN-to-MLP distillation aims to utilize knowledge distillation (KD) to learn computationally-efficient multi-layer perceptron (student MLP) on graph data by mimicking the output representations of teacher GNN. Existing methods mainly make the MLP to mimic the GNN predictions over a few class labels. However, the class space may not be expressive enough for covering numerous diverse local graph structures, thus limiting the performance of knowledge transfer from GNN to MLP. To address this issue, we propose to learn a new powerful graph representation space by directly labeling nodes' diverse local structures for GNN-to-MLP distillation. Specifically, we propose a variant of VQ-VAE to learn a structure-aware tokenizer on graph data that can encode each node's local substructure as a discrete code. The discrete codes constitute a codebook as a new graph representation space that is able to identify different local graph structures of nodes with the corresponding code indices. Then, based on the learned codebook, we propose a new distillation target, namely soft code assignments, to directly transfer the structural knowledge of each node from GNN to MLP. The resulting framework VQGraph achieves new state-of-the-art performance on GNN-to-MLP distillation in both transductive and inductive settings across seven graph datasets. We show that VQGraph with better performance infers faster than GNNs by 828×, and also achieves accuracy improvement over GNNs and stand-alone MLPs by 3.90% and 28.05% on average, respectively.},

However, this ability is hindered by distribution shifts between the training and testing data. Previous test time adaptation (TTA) methods for VLMs in zero-shot classification rely on minimizing the entropy of model outputs and tend to be stuck in incorrect model predictions. In this work, we propose a novel approach for TTA where a CLIP model is adopted as the reward model and provides feedback for the VLM. Given a single test sample, the VLM is forced to maximize the CLIP reward between the input and sampled results from the VLM output distribution. We call this approach Reinforcement Learning with CLIP Feedback (RLCF). RLCF is highly flexible and universal, which can be easily extended to not only discrimination tasks like retrieval but also generalization tasks like image captioning.},

The natural questions are: i) Retrieval-augmentation versus long context window, which one is better for downstream tasks? ii) Can both methods be combined to get the best of both worlds? In this work, we answer these questions by studying both solutions using two state-of-the-art pretrained {LLMs}, i.e., a proprietary 43B {GPT} and Llama2-70B. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that {LLM} with 4K context window using simple retrieval-augmentation at generation can achieve comparable performance to finetuned {LLM} with 16K context window via positional interpolation on long context tasks, while taking much less computation. More importantly, we demonstrate that retrieval can significantly improve the performance of {LLMs} regardless of their extended context window sizes. Our best model, retrieval-augmented Llama2-70B with 32K context window, outperforms {GPT}-3.5-turbo-16k and Davinci003 in terms of average score on nine long context tasks including question answering, query-based summarization, and in-context few-shot learning tasks.},

Nevertheless, concerns persist regarding the accuracy and appropriateness of their generated content. A contemporary methodology, self-correction, has been proposed as a remedy to these issues. Building upon this premise, this paper critically examines the role and efficacy of self-correction within {LLMs}, shedding light on its true potential and limitations. Central to our investigation is the notion of intrinsic self-correction, whereby an {LLM} attempts to correct its initial responses based solely on its inherent capabilities, without the crutch of external feedback. In the context of reasoning, our research indicates that {LLMs} struggle to self-correct their responses without external feedback, and at times, their performance even degrades after self-correction. Drawing from these insights, we offer suggestions for future research and practical applications in this field.},

@inproceedings{yang2024objectaware,
  abstract = {By comparing the original and target prompts, we can obtain numerous editing pairs, each comprising an object and its corresponding editing target. To allow editability while maintaining fidelity to the input image, existing editing methods typically involve a fixed number of inversion steps that project the whole input image to its noisier latent representation, followed by a denoising process guided by the target prompt. However, we find that the optimal number of inversion steps for achieving ideal editing results varies significantly among different editing pairs, owing to varying editing difficulties. Therefore, the current literature, which relies on a fixed number of inversion steps, produces sub-optimal generation quality, especially when handling multiple editing pairs in a natural image. To this end, we propose a new image editing paradigm, dubbed Object-aware Inversion and Reassembly ({OIR}), to enable object-level fine-grained editing. Specifically, we design a new search metric, which determines the optimal inversion steps for each editing pair, by jointly considering the editability of the target and the fidelity of the non-editing region. We use our search metric to find the optimal inversion step for each editing pair when editing an image. We then edit these editing pairs separately to avoid concept mismatch. Subsequently, we propose an additional reassembly step to seamlessly integrate the respective editing results and the non-editing region to obtain the final edited image.},

However, datasets collected by humans in real-world environments are often noisy and may even be maliciously corrupted, which can significantly degrade the performance of offline {RL}. In this work, we first investigate the performance of current offline {RL} algorithms under comprehensive data corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics. Our extensive experiments reveal that implicit {Q}-learning ({IQL}) demonstrates remarkable resilience to data corruption among various offline {RL} algorithms. Furthermore, we conduct both empirical and theoretical analyses to understand {IQL}'s robust performance, identifying its supervised policy learning scheme as the key factor. Despite its relative robustness, {IQL} still suffers from heavy-tail targets of {Q} functions under dynamics corruption. To tackle this challenge, we draw inspiration from robust statistics to employ the {Huber} loss to handle the heavy-tailedness and utilize quantile estimators to balance penalization for corrupted data and learning stability. By incorporating these simple yet effective modifications into {IQL}, we propose a more robust offline {RL} approach named Robust {IQL} ({RIQL}). Extensive experiments demonstrate that {RIQL} exhibits highly robust performance when subjected to diverse data corruption scenarios.},

The purpose of fusion is to capitalize on the advantages of each modality while minimizing its weaknesses. Advanced deep neural network ({DNN})-based fusion techniques have demonstrated the exceptional and industry-leading performance. Due to the redundant information in multiple modalities, {MSF} is also recognized as a general defence strategy against adversarial attacks. In this paper, we attack fusion models from the camera modality that is considered to be of lesser importance in fusion but is more affordable for attackers. We argue that the weakest link of fusion models depends on their most vulnerable modality and propose an attack framework that targets advanced camera-{LiDAR} fusion-based {3D} object detection models through camera-only adversarial attacks. Our approach employs a two-stage optimization-based strategy that first thoroughly evaluates vulnerable image areas under adversarial attacks, and then applies dedicated attack strategies for different fusion models to generate deployable patches. The evaluations with six advanced camera-{LiDAR} fusion models and one camera-only model indicate that our attacks successfully compromise all of them. Our approach can either decrease the mean average precision ({mAP}) of detection performance from 0.824 to 0.353 or degrade the detection score of a target object from 0.728 to 0.156, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed attack framework.

Although several preventive measures have been developed to mitigate the potential risks associated with {LLMs}, they have primarily focused on English. In this work, we reveal the multilingual jailbreak challenges that exist in {LLMs} and investigate potential ways to mitigate such challenges. Specifically, we first investigate two scenarios of multilingual jailbreak: (1) replicating harmful content by translating unsafe English instructions into low-resource languages, and (2) unsafe {LLM} usage by triggering {LLMs} to respond to harmful content with multilingual prompts. We discover that low-resource languages suffer from the lack of safety alignment and have around 3\times higher rates of unsafe responses. More concerningly, we find that multilingual prompts can be used to successfully bypass the safety alignment of {LLMs}, increasing the unsafe response rates to 80.92\% for {ChatGPT} and 40.71\% for {GPT-4}. To mitigate such challenges, we propose a Self-Defense framework that leverages multilingual safety training data to enhance cross-lingual safety alignment. Experiment results on two safety benchmarks with human annotations show that our approach significantly improves multilingual safety alignment for both low-resource languages and multilingual settings while maintaining model performance.},

  abstract = {Deep graph clustering has recently received significant attention due to its ability to enhance the representation learning capabilities of models in unsupervised scenarios. Nevertheless, deep clustering for temporal graphs, which could capture crucial dynamic interaction information, has not been fully explored. It means that in many clustering-oriented real-world scenarios, temporal graphs can only be processed as static graphs. This not only causes the loss of dynamic information but also triggers huge computational consumption. To solve the problem, we propose a general framework for deep Temporal Graph Clustering called {TGC}, which introduces deep clustering techniques to suit the interaction sequence-based batch-processing pattern of temporal graphs. Concretely, we build our {TGC} model with a powerful temporal graph encoder and a joint clustering framework which could incorporate deep embedding clustering and community detection clustering. To assess the performance of {TGC}, we construct multiple temporal graph clustering datasets and conduct experiments with typical deep graph clustering methods and temporal graph learning models. The results show the effectiveness of our {TGC} and its flexibility to balance the requirements for time and space.},

@inproceedings{chen2024recursive,
  abstract = {Transformer architectures have exhibited remarkable performance in image super-resolution ({SR}). Since the quadratic computational complexity of the self-attention ({SA}) in Transformer, existing methods tend to adopt {SA} in a local region to reduce overheads. However, the local design restricts the global context exploitation, which is crucial for accurate image reconstruction. In this work, we propose the Recursive Generalization Transformer ({RGT}) for image {SR}, which can capture global spatial information and is suitable for high-resolution images. Specifically, we propose the recursive-generalization self-attention ({RG-SA}). It recursively aggregates input features into representative feature maps, and then utilizes cross-attention to extract global information. Meanwhile, the channel dimensions of attention matrices (query, key, and value) are further scaled to mitigate the redundancy in the channel domain. Furthermore, we combine the {RG-SA} with local self-attention to enhance the exploitation of the global context, and propose the hybrid adaptive integration ({HAI}) for module integration. The {HAI} allows the direct and effective fusion between features at different levels (local or global). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our {RGT} outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.},

  abstract = {We aim at exploiting additional auxiliary labels from an independent (auxiliary) task to boost the primary task performance which we focus on, while preserving a single task inference cost of the primary task. While most existing auxiliary learning methods are optimization-based relying on loss weights/gradients manipulation, our method is architecture-based with a flexible asymmetric structure for the primary and auxiliary tasks, which produces different networks for training and inference. Specifically, starting from two single task networks/branches (each representing a task), we propose a novel method with evolving networks where only primary-to-auxiliary links exist as the cross-task connections after convergence. These connections can be removed during the primary task inference, resulting in a single-task inference cost. We achieve this by formulating a Neural Architecture Search ({NAS}) problem, where we initialize bi-directional connections in the search space and guide the {NAS} optimization converging to an architecture with only the single-side primary-to-auxiliary connections. Moreover, our method can be incorporated with optimization-based auxiliary learning approaches. Extensive experiments with six tasks on {NYU} v2, {CityScapes}, and {Taskonomy} datasets using {VGG}, {ResNet}, and {ViT} backbones validate the promising performance.},

Self-supervised learning ({SSL}) emerges as a promising approach that leverages inherent patterns within data through diverse augmentations to train models without explicit labels. However, {SSL}'s high computation costs remain a significant impediment, particularly for resource-constrained platforms. To address this challenge, we introduce {SimWnW}, a similarity-based efficient self-supervised learning framework. {SimWnW} works by strategically removing less important regions in augmented images and feature maps, which not only reduces computation costs but also eliminates irrelevant features that might slow down the learning process, thereby accelerating model convergence. Our experimental results demonstrate that {SimWnW} effectively reduces computation costs in self-supervised model training without compromising accuracy. Specifically, {SimWnW} yields up to 54\% and 51\% computation savings in training from scratch and transfer learning tasks, respectively. The framework provides a generic solution that can be applied to various self-supervised learning methods, making it broadly applicable for efficient representation learning.},

@inproceedings{chen2024decentralized,
  abstract = {The conjugate gradient method is a crucial first-order optimization method that generally converges faster than the steepest descent method, and its computational cost is much lower than that of second-order methods. However, while various types of conjugate gradient methods have been studied in Euclidean spaces and on Riemannian manifolds, there is little study for those in distributed scenarios. This paper proposes a decentralized Riemannian conjugate gradient descent (DRCGD) method that aims at minimizing a global function over the Stiefel manifold. The optimization problem is distributed among a network of agents, where each agent is associated with a local function, and the communication between agents occurs over an undirected connected graph. Since the Stiefel manifold is a non-convex set, a global function is represented as a finite sum of possibly non-convex (but smooth) local functions. The proposed method is free from expensive Riemannian geometric operations such as retractions, exponential maps, and vector transports, thereby reducing the computational complexity required by each agent. To the best of our knowledge, DRCGD is the first decentralized Riemannian conjugate gradient algorithm to achieve global convergence over the Stiefel manifold.},

  abstract = {The approach of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is widely used for enhancing pre-trained Language Models (LM), enabling them to better align with human preferences. Existing RLHF-based LMs however require complete retraining whenever new queries or feedback are introduced, as human preferences may differ across different domains or topics. LM retraining is often impracticable in most real-world scenarios, due to the substantial time and computational costs involved, as well as data privacy concerns. To address this limitation, we propose Continual Proximal Policy Optimization (CPPO), a novel method that is able to continually align LM with dynamic human preferences. Specifically, CPPO adopts a weighting strategy to decide which samples should be utilized for enhancing policy learning and which should be used for solidifying past experiences. This seeks a good trade-off between policy learning and knowledge retention. Our experimental results show that CPPO outperforms strong Continuous learning (CL) baselines when it comes to consistently aligning with human preferences. Furthermore, compared to PPO, CPPO offers more efficient and stable learning in non-continual scenarios.},

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel generative pre-training framework, GPD, for spatio-temporal few-shot learning with urban knowledge transfer. Unlike conventional approaches that heavily rely on common feature extraction or intricate few-shot learning designs, our solution takes a novel approach by performing generative pre-training on a collection of neural network parameters optimized with data from source cities. We recast spatio-temporal few-shot learning as pre-training a generative diffusion model, which generates tailored neural networks guided by prompts, allowing for adaptability to diverse data distributions and city-specific characteristics. GPD employs a Transformer-based denoising diffusion model, which is model-agnostic to integrate with powerful spatio-temporal neural networks. By addressing challenges arising from data gaps and the complexity of generalizing knowledge across cities, our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multiple real-world datasets for tasks such as traffic speed prediction and crowd flow prediction.},

In this work, we investigate the diffusion (physics) in diffusion (machine learning) properties and propose our Cyclic One-Way Diffusion (COW) method to control the direction of diffusion phenomenon given a pre-trained frozen diffusion model for versatile customization application scenarios, where the low-level pixel information from the conditioning needs to be preserved. Notably, unlike most current methods that incorporate additional conditions by fine-tuning the base text-to-image diffusion model or learning auxiliary networks, our method provides a novel perspective to understand the task needs and is applicable to a wider range of customization scenarios in a learning-free manner. Extensive experiment results show that our proposed COW can achieve more flexible customization based on strict visual conditions in different application settings.},

FL claims that the data privacy of local participants is preserved well because local data will not be shared with either the server-side or other training participants. However, this paper discovers a pioneering finding that a model inversion (MI) attacker, who acts as a benign participant, can invert the shared global model and obtain the data belonging to other participants. Therefore, it is important to evaluate such data-leakage risks of an FL system before using it. To alleviate this issue, we propose FedInverse to evaluate whether the FL global model can be inverted by MI attackers. In particular, FedInverse can be optimized by leveraging the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) as a regularizer to adjust the diversity of the MI attack generator. We test FedInverse with three typical MI attackers, GMI, KED-MI, and VMI, and the experiments show our FedInverse method can successfully obtain the data belonging to other participants.},

  abstract = {Designing a single model to address multiple tasks has been a long-standing objective in artificial intelligence. Recently, large language models have demonstrated exceptional capability in solving different tasks within the language domain. However, a unified model for various graph tasks remains underexplored, primarily due to the challenges unique to the graph learning domain. First, graph data from different areas carry distinct attributes and follow different distributions. Such discrepancy makes it hard to represent graphs in a single representation space. Second, tasks on graphs diversify into node, link, and graph tasks, requiring distinct embedding strategies. Finally, an appropriate graph prompting paradigm for in-context learning is unclear. To address these challenges, we propose One For All (OFA), the first general-purpose graph foundation model that can solve graph problems across diverse domains and tasks. Specifically, OFA proposes text-attributed graphs to unify different graph data by describing nodes and edges with natural language and uses language models to encode the diverse and possibly cross-domain text attributes to feature vectors in the same embedding space. Furthermore, OFA introduces the concept of nodes-of-interest to standardize different tasks with a single task representation. For in-context learning on graphs, OFA introduces a novel graph prompting paradigm that appends prompting substructures to the input graph, which enables it to address varied tasks without fine-tuning. We train the OFA model using graph data from multiple domains (including citation networks, molecular graphs, knowledge graphs, etc.) simultaneously and evaluate its ability in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot learning scenarios. OFA performs well across different tasks, making it the first general-purpose across-domains classification model on graphs.},

Specifically, the implicit reconstruction process is based on the knowledge from the previous old domain, aiming to convert the domain-related knowledge into domain-invariant representations, e.g., 3D scene-level meshes. Besides, the point clouds simulation process of multiple new domains is conditioned on the above reconstructed 3D meshes, where the target-domain-like simulation samples can be obtained, thus reducing the cost of collecting and annotating new-domain data for the subsequent perception process. For experiments, we consider different cross-domain situations such as Waymo-to-KITTI, Waymo-to-nuScenes, etc, to verify the zero-shot target-domain perception using ReSimAD.

Specifically, an LLM is utilized to carry out a direct mapping from the N-best hypotheses list generated by an ASR system to the predicted output transcription. However, despite its effectiveness, GER introduces extra data uncertainty since the LLM is trained without taking into account acoustic information available in the speech signal. In this work, we aim to overcome such a limitation by infusing acoustic information before generating the predicted transcription through a novel late fusion solution termed Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Fusion (UADF). UADF is a multimodal fusion approach implemented into an auto-regressive decoding process and works in two stages: (i) It first analyzes and calibrates the token-level LLM decision, and (ii) it then dynamically assimilates the information from the acoustic modality. Experimental evidence collected from various ASR tasks shows that UADF surpasses existing fusion mechanisms in several ways. It yields significant improvements in word error rate (WER) while mitigating data uncertainty issues in LLM and addressing the poor generalization relied with sole modality during fusion. We also demonstrate that UADF seamlessly adapts to audio-visual speech recognition.},

  abstract = {Vanilla image completion approaches exhibit sensitivity to large missing regions, attributed to the limited availability of reference information for plausible generation. To mitigate this, existing methods incorporate the extra cue as a guidance for image completion. Despite improvements, these approaches are often restricted to employing a single modality (e.g., segmentation or sketch maps), which lacks scalability in leveraging multi-modality for more plausible completion. In this paper, we propose a novel, simple yet effective method for Multi-modal Guided Image Completion, dubbed {MaGIC}, which not only supports a wide range of single modality as the guidance (e.g., text, canny edge, sketch, segmentation, depth, and pose), but also adapts to arbitrarily customized combination of these modalities (i.e., arbitrary multi-modality) for image completion. For building {MaGIC}, we first introduce a modality-specific conditional {U-Net} ({MCU-Net}) that injects single-modal signal into a {U-Net} denoiser for single-modal guided image completion. Then, we devise a consistent modality blending ({CMB}) method to leverage modality signals encoded in multiple learned {MCU-Nets} through gradient guidance in latent space. Our {CMB} is training-free, thereby avoids the cumbersome joint re-training of different modalities, which is the secret of {MaGIC} to achieve exceptional flexibility in accommodating new modalities for completion. Experiments show the superiority of {MaGIC} over state-of-the-art methods and its generalization to various completion tasks.},

  abstract = {Pre-training on large-scale datasets and then fine-tuning on downstream tasks have become a standard practice in deep learning. However, pre-training data often contain label noise that may adversely affect the generalization of the model. This paper aims to understand the nature of noise in pre-training datasets and to mitigate its impact on downstream tasks. Through extensive experiments on synthetic noisy datasets, we discover that while slight noise in pre-training can benefit in-domain ({ID}) transfer performance, where the training and testing data share the same distribution, it always deteriorates out-of-domain ({OOD}) performance, where training and testing data distribution are different. The reason is that noise in pre-training shapes the feature space differently, which affects model generalization capabilities. To mitigate the malignant effect of noise and improve generalization on both {ID} and {OOD} tasks, we propose a light-weight black-box tuning method ({NMTune}) to affine the feature space, considering one may not be able to fully fine-tune or even access the pre-trained models. Practical experiments on popular vision and language models that are pre-trained on noisy data show the effectiveness of our approach.},

Two popular strategies are per-sample clipping, which clips the mini-batch gradient, and per-update clipping, which clips each user's model update. However, there has not been a thorough theoretical analysis of these two clipping methods. In this work, we rigorously analyze the impact of these two clipping techniques on the convergence of a popular federated learning algorithm {FedAvg} under standard stochastic noise and gradient dissimilarity assumptions. Our analysis provides convergence guarantees for both clipping methods given any arbitrary clipping threshold. Specifically, we show that per-sample clipping is guaranteed to converge to the neighborhood of the stationary point, with the size dependent on the stochastic noise, gradient dissimilarity, and clipping threshold. For per-update clipping, we show that convergence to the stationary point can be guaranteed with a sufficiently small stepsize, at the cost of more communication rounds. Our theoretical results provide new insights into understanding the effect of the two clipping methods on federated learning and their implications for differential privacy.},

  abstract = {Instruction tuning is a standard technique employed to align large language models to end tasks and user preferences after the initial pretraining phase. Recent research indicates the critical role of data engineering in instruction tuning -- when appropriately selected, only limited data is necessary to achieve superior performance. However, we still lack a principled understanding of what makes good instruction tuning data for alignment, and how we should select data automatically and effectively. In this work, we delve deeply into automatic data selection strategies for alignment. We start with controlled studies to measure data across three dimensions: complexity, quality, and diversity, along which we examine existing methods and introduce novel techniques for enhanced data measurement. Subsequently, we propose a simple strategy to select data samples based on the measurement. We present {Deita} (short for Data-Efficient Instruction Tuning for Alignment), a series of models fine-tuned from {LLaMA} models using data samples automatically selected with our proposed approach. When assessed through both automatic metrics and human evaluation, {Deita} performs better or on par with the state-of-the-art open-source alignment models such as {Vicuna} and {WizardLM} with only {6K} training data samples -- 10x less than the data used in the baselines. We anticipate this work to provide clear guidelines and tools on automatic data selection, aiding researchers and practitioners in achieving data-efficient alignment.},

@inproceedings{wang2024topological,
  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks ({GNNs}) have shown great promise in learning node embeddings for link prediction ({LP}). While numerous studies improve the overall {GNNs}' {LP} performance, none have explored their varying performance across different nodes and the underlying reasons. To this end, we demystify which nodes perform better from the perspective of their local topology. Despite the widespread belief that low-degree nodes exhibit worse {LP} performance, we surprisingly observe an inconsistent performance trend. This prompts us to propose a node-level metric, Topological Concentration ({TC}), based on the intersection of the local subgraph of each node with the ones of its neighbors. We empirically demonstrate that {TC} correlates with {LP} performance more than other node-level topological metrics, better identifying low-performing nodes than using degree. With {TC}, we discover a novel topological distribution shift issue in which nodes' newly joined neighbors tend to become less interactive with their existing neighbors, compromising the generalizability of node embeddings for {LP} at testing time. To make the computation of {TC} scalable, we further propose Approximated Topological Concentration ({ATC}) and justify its efficacy in approximating {TC} with reduced computation complexity. Given the positive correlation between node {TC} and its {LP} performance, we explore the potential of boosting {LP} performance via enhancing {TC} by re-weighting edges in the message-passing and discuss its effectiveness with limitations.},

@inproceedings{eli2024efficient,
  abstract = {Catastrophic overfitting ({CO}) in single-step adversarial training ({AT}) results in abrupt drops in the adversarial test accuracy (even down to 0\%). For models trained with multi-step {AT}, it has been observed that the loss function behaves locally linearly with respect to the input, this is however lost in single-step {AT}. To address {CO} in single-step {AT}, several methods have been proposed to enforce local linearity of the loss via regularization. However, these regularization terms considerably slow down training due to Double Backpropagation. Instead, in this work, we introduce a regularization term, called {ELLE}, to mitigate {CO} effectively and efficiently in classical {AT} evaluations, as well as some more difficult regimes, e.g., large adversarial perturbations and long training schedules. Our regularization term can be theoretically linked to curvature of the loss function and is computationally cheaper than previous methods by avoiding Double Backpropagation. Our thorough experimental validation demonstrates that our work does not suffer from {CO}, even in challenging settings where previous works suffer from it. We also notice that adapting our regularization parameter during training ({ELLE-A}) greatly improves the performance, specially in large ε setups.},

If models are averaged at the end of training, this can only lead to a good performing model if the loss surface of interest is very particular, i.e., the loss in the midpoint between the two models needs to be sufficiently low. This is impossible to guarantee for the non-convex losses of state-of-the-art networks. For averaging models trained on vastly different datasets, it was proposed to average only the parameters of particular layers or combinations of layers, resulting in better performing models. To get a better understanding of the effect of layer-wise averaging, we analyse the performance of the models that result from averaging single layers, or groups of layers. Based on our empirical and theoretical investigation, we introduce a novel notion of the layer-wise linear connectivity, and show that deep networks do not have layer-wise barriers between them.},

However, such unidirectional generation is highly prone to motion drifting over time, generating unrealistic human animation with significant artifacts such as appearance distortion. We claim that bidirectional temporal modeling enforces temporal coherence on a generative network by largely suppressing the appearance ambiguity. To prove our claim, we design a novel human animation framework using a denoising diffusion model: a neural network learns to generate the image of a person by denoising temporal Gaussian noises whose intermediate results are cross-conditioned bidirectionally between consecutive frames. In the experiments, our method demonstrates strong performance compared to existing unidirectional approaches with realistic temporal coherence.},

However, current KD methods for auto-regressive sequence models suffer from distribution mismatch between output sequences seen during training and those generated by the student during inference. To address this issue, we introduce Generalized Knowledge Distillation (GKD). Instead of solely relying on a fixed set of output sequences, GKD trains the student on its self-generated output sequences by leveraging feedback from the teacher on such sequences. Unlike supervised KD approaches, GKD also offers the flexibility to employ alternative loss functions between the student and teacher, which can be useful when the student lacks the expressivity to mimic the teacher's distribution. Furthermore, GKD facilitates the seamless integration of distillation with RL fine-tuning (RLHF). We demonstrate the efficacy of GKD for distilling auto-regressive language models on summarization, translation, and arithmetic reasoning tasks, and task-agnostic distillation for instruction-tuning.},

  abstract = {Estimating individual treatment effects in clinical data is essential for understanding how different patients uniquely respond to treatments and identifying the most effective interventions for specific patient subgroups, thereby enhancing the precision and personalization of healthcare. However, counterfactual data are not accessible, and the true calculation of causal effects cannot be performed at the individual level. This paper proposes a linear algebraic framework to generate counterfactual longitudinal data that exactly matches pre-treatment factual data. Using simulated LDL cholesterol datasets, the authors show that their method significantly outperforms the most cited methods of counterfactual generation. They also provide a formula that can estimate the time-varying variance of individual treatment effects, interpreted as a confidence level in the generated counterfactuals compared to true values.},

@inproceedings{alabdulmohsin2024clip,
  abstract = {We study data-balancing for mitigating biases in contrastive language-image pretraining ({CLIP}), identifying areas of strength and limitation. First, we reaffirm prior conclusions that {CLIP} can inadvertently absorb stereotypes. To counter this, we present a novel algorithm, called Multi-Modal Moment Matching ({M4}), designed to reduce both representation and association biases in multimodal data. We use {M4} to conduct an in-depth analysis taking into account various factors, such as the model, representation, and data size. Our study also explores the dynamic nature of how {CLIP} learns/unlearns biases. In particular, we find that fine-tuning is effective in countering representation biases, though its impact diminishes for association biases. Also, data balancing has a mixed impact on quality: it tends to improve classification but can hurt retrieval. Interestingly, data and architectural improvements seem to mitigate the negative impact of data balancing on performance; e.g. applying {M4} to {SigLIP}-{B}/16 with data quality filters improves {COCO} image-to-text retrieval @5 from 86\% (without data balancing) to 87\% and {ImageNet} 0-shot classification from 77\% to 77.5\%! Finally, we conclude with recommendations for improving the efficacy of data balancing in multimodal systems.},

  abstract = {Given a set of {K} probability densities, we consider the multimarginal generative modeling problem of learning a joint distribution that recovers these densities as marginals. The structure of this joint distribution should identify multi-way correspondences among the prescribed marginals. We formalize an approach to this task within a generalization of the stochastic interpolant framework, leading to efficient learning algorithms built upon dynamical transport of measure. Our generative models are defined by velocity and score fields that can be characterized as the minimizers of simple quadratic objectives, and they are defined on a simplex that generalizes the time variable in the usual dynamical transport framework. The resulting transport on the simplex is influenced by all marginals, and we show that multi-way correspondences can be extracted. The identification of such correspondences has applications to style transfer, algorithmic fairness, and data decorruption. In addition, the multimarginal perspective enables an efficient algorithm for optimizing the dynamical transport cost in the ordinary two-marginal setting. We demonstrate these capacities with several numerical examples.},

We conduct a thorough analytical and empirical analysis using state-of-the-art generative image models of three families of autophagous loops that differ in how fixed or fresh real training data is available through the generations of training and whether the samples from previous-generation models have been biased to trade off data quality versus diversity. Our primary conclusion across all scenarios is that \emph{without enough fresh real data in each generation of an autophagous loop, future generative models are doomed to have their quality (precision) or diversity (recall) progressively decrease.} We term this condition Model Autophagy Disorder ({MAD}), by analogy to mad cow disease, and show that appreciable {MAD}ness arises in just a few generations.},

@inproceedings{alikhasi2024unveiling,
  abstract = {In reinforcement learning, agents often learn policies for specific tasks without the ability to generalize this knowledge to related tasks. This paper introduces an algorithm that attempts to address this limitation by decomposing neural networks encoding policies for {M}arkov {D}ecision {P}rocesses into reusable sub-policies, which are used to synthesize temporally extended actions, or options. We consider neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions, so that they can be mapped to an equivalent tree that is similar to oblique decision trees. Since each node in such a tree serves as a function of the input of the tree, each sub-tree is a sub-policy of the main policy. We turn each of these sub-policies into options by wrapping it with while-loops of varied number of iterations. Given the large number of options, we propose a selection mechanism based on minimizing the {L}evin loss for a uniform policy on these options. Empirical results in two grid-world domains where exploration can be difficult confirm that our method can identify useful options, thereby accelerating the learning process on similar but different tasks.},

@inproceedings{alleman2024task,
  abstract = {The utility of a learned neural representation depends on how well its geometry supports performance in downstream tasks. This geometry depends on the structure of the inputs, the structure of the target outputs, and on the architecture of the network. By studying the learning dynamics of networks with one hidden layer, we discovered that the network's activation function has an unexpectedly strong impact on the representational geometry: {T}anh networks tend to learn representations that reflect the structure of the target outputs, while {ReLU} networks retain more information about the structure of the raw inputs. This difference is consistently observed across a broad class of parameterized tasks in which we modulated the degree of alignment between the geometry of the task inputs and that of the task labels. We analyzed the learning dynamics in weight space and show how the differences between the networks with {T}anh and {ReLU} nonlinearities arise from the asymmetric saturation of {ReLU}, which leads feature neurons to specialize for different regions of input space. Feature neurons in {T}anh networks, by contrast, tend to inherit the task label structure. Consequently, when the target outputs are low dimensional, {T}anh networks generate neural representations that are more disentangled than those obtained with a {ReLU} nonlinearity. Our findings shed light on the interplay between input-output geometry, nonlinearity, and learned representations in neural networks.},

  abstract = {Modern {ML} applications increasingly rely on complex deep learning models and large datasets. There has been an exponential growth in the amount of computation needed to train the largest models. Therefore, to scale computation and data, these models are inevitably trained in a distributed manner in clusters of nodes, and their updates are aggregated before being applied to the model. However, a distributed setup is prone to {B}yzantine failures of individual nodes, components, and software. With data augmentation added to these settings, there is a critical need for robust and efficient aggregation systems. We define the quality of workers as reconstruction ratios $\in (0,1]$, and formulate aggregation as a {M}aximum {L}ikelihood {E}stimation procedure using {B}eta densities. We show that the {R}egularized form of log-likelihood wrt subspace can be approximately solved using iterative least squares solver, and provide convergence guarantees using recent {C}onvex {O}ptimization landscape results. Our empirical findings demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of state-of-the-art {B}yzantine resilient aggregators.

We study the sample complexity of contrastive learning, i.e. the minimum number of labeled tuples sufficient for getting high generalization accuracy. We give tight bounds on the sample complexity in a variety of settings, focusing on arbitrary distance functions, $\ell_p$-distances, and tree metrics. Our main result is an (almost) optimal bound on the sample complexity of learning $\ell_p$-distances for integer $p$. For any $p \geq 1$, we show that $\tilde{\Theta}(nd)$ labeled tuples are necessary and sufficient for learning $d$-dimensional representations of $n$-point datasets. Our results hold for an arbitrary distribution of the input samples and are based on giving the corresponding bounds on the {V}apnik-{C}hervonenkis/{N}atarajan dimension of the associated problems.

  abstract = {The theories of offline and online reinforcement learning, despite having evolved in parallel, have begun to show signs of the possibility for a unification, with algorithms and analysis techniques for one setting often having natural counterparts in the other. However, the notion of \emph{density ratio modeling}, an emerging paradigm in offline RL, has been largely absent from online RL, perhaps for good reason: the very existence and boundedness of density ratios relies on access to an exploratory dataset with good coverage, but the core challenge in online RL is to collect such a dataset without having one to start. In this work we show---perhaps surprisingly---that density ratio-based algorithms have online counterparts. Assuming only the existence of an exploratory distribution with good coverage, a structural condition known as \emph{coverability} (Xie et al., 2023), we give a new algorithm (GLOW) that uses density ratio realizability and value function realizability to perform sample-efficient online exploration. GLOW addresses unbounded density ratios via careful use of truncation, and combines this with optimism to guide exploration. GLOW is computationally inefficient; we complement it with a more efficient counterpart, HyGLOW, for the Hybrid RL setting (Song et al., 2023) wherein online RL is augmented with additional offline data. HyGLOW is derived as a special case of a more general meta-algorithm that provides a provable black-box reduction from hybrid RL to offline RL, which may be of independent interest.},

@inproceedings{amos2024never,
  abstract = {Modeling long-range dependencies across sequences is a longstanding goal in machine learning and has led to architectures, such as state space models, that dramatically outperform Transformers on long sequences. However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, *using only the downstream task data*, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.},

  abstract = {Existing NAS methods suffer from either an excessive amount of time for repetitive sampling and training of many task-irrelevant architectures. To tackle such limitations of existing NAS methods, we propose a paradigm shift from NAS to a novel conditional Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) framework based on diffusion models, dubbed DiffusionNAG. Specifically, we consider the neural architectures as directed graphs and propose a graph diffusion model for generating them. Moreover, with the guidance of parameterized predictors, DiffusionNAG can flexibly generate task-optimal architectures with the desired properties for diverse tasks, by sampling from a region that is more likely to satisfy the properties. This conditional NAG scheme is significantly more efficient than previous NAS schemes which sample the architectures and filter them using the property predictors. We validate the effectiveness of DiffusionNAG through extensive experiments in two predictor-based NAS scenarios: Transferable NAS and Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based NAS. DiffusionNAG achieves superior performance with speedups of up to 35 times when compared to the baselines on Transferable NAS benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into a BO-based algorithm, DiffusionNAG outperforms existing BO-based NAS approaches, particularly in the large MobileNetV3 search space on the ImageNet 1K dataset.},

However, the equivariant operations in each layer can impose excessive constraints on the function form and network flexibility. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel network called the Hybrid Directional Graph Neural Network (HDGNN), which effectively combines strictly equivariant operations with learnable modules. We evaluate the performance of HDGNN on the QM9 dataset and the IS2RE dataset of OC20, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance on several tasks and competitive performance on others.},

  abstract = {Vision-language models like CLIP are widely used in zero-shot image classification due to their ability to understand various visual concepts and natural language descriptions. However, how to fully leverage CLIP's unprecedented human-like understanding capabilities to achieve better performance is still an open question. This paper draws inspiration from the human visual perception process: when classifying an object, humans first infer contextual attributes (e.g., background and orientation) which help separate the foreground object from the background, and then classify the object based on this information. Inspired by it, we observe that providing CLIP with contextual attributes improves zero-shot image classification and mitigates reliance on spurious features. We also observe that CLIP itself can reasonably infer the attributes from an image. With these observations, we propose a training-free, two-step zero-shot classification method PerceptionCLIP. Given an image, it first infers contextual attributes (e.g., background) and then performs object classification conditioning on them. Our experiments show that PerceptionCLIP achieves better generalization, group robustness, and interpretability.},

@inproceedings{anciukeviius2024denoising,
  abstract = {Generating 3D scenes is a challenging open problem, which requires synthesizing plausible content that is fully consistent in 3D space. While recent methods such as neural radiance fields excel at view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, they cannot synthesize plausible details in unobserved regions since they lack a generative capability. Conversely, existing generative methods are typically not capable of reconstructing detailed, large-scale scenes in the wild, as they use limited-capacity 3D scene representations, require aligned camera poses, or rely on additional regularizers. In this work, we introduce the first diffusion model able to perform fast, detailed reconstruction and generation of real-world 3D scenes. To achieve this, we make three contributions. First, we introduce a new neural scene representation, IB-planes, that can efficiently and accurately represent large 3D scenes, dynamically allocating more capacity as needed to capture details visible in each image. Second, we propose a denoising-diffusion framework to learn a prior over this novel 3D scene representation, using only 2D images without the need for any additional supervision signal such as masks or depths. This supports 3D reconstruction and generation in a unified architecture. Third, we develop a principled approach to avoid trivial 3D solutions when integrating the image-based rendering with the diffusion model, by dropping out representations of some images. We evaluate the model on several challenging datasets of real and synthetic images, and demonstrate superior results on generation, novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction.},

@inproceedings{andrade2024sparsistency,
  abstract = {Optimal Transport is a useful metric to compare probability distributions and to compute a pairing given a ground cost. Its entropic regularization variant (eOT) is crucial to have fast algorithms and reflect fuzzy/noisy matchings. This work focuses on Inverse Optimal Transport (iOT), the problem of inferring the ground cost from samples drawn from a coupling that solves an eOT problem. It is a relevant problem that can be used to infer unobserved/missing links, and to obtain meaningful information about the structure of the ground cost yielding the pairing. On one side, iOT benefits from convexity, but on the other side, being ill-posed, it requires regularization to handle the sampling noise. This work presents an in-depth theoretical study of the $\ell_1$ regularization to model for instance Euclidean costs with sparse interactions between features. Specifically, we derive a sufficient condition for the robust recovery of the sparsity of the ground cost that can be seen as a far reaching generalization of the Lasso's celebrated ``Irrepresentability Condition''. To provide additional insight into this condition (consequently on the types of recoverable costs) we work out in detail the Gaussian case. Surprisingly, varying the entropic regularizer provides evidence that the Gaussian iOT interpolates between a graphical Lasso and a classical Lasso, thereby establishing a connection between iOT and graph estimation, an important problem in ML.},

@inproceedings{andrew2024oneshot,
  abstract = {Privacy estimation techniques for differentially private (DP) algorithms are useful for comparing against analytical bounds, or to empirically measure privacy loss in settings where known analytical bounds are not tight. However, existing privacy auditing techniques usually make strong assumptions on the adversary (e.g., knowledge of intermediate model iterates or the training data distribution), are tailored to specific tasks, model architectures, or DP algorithm, and/or require retraining the model many times (typically on the order of thousands). These shortcomings make deploying such techniques at scale difficult in practice, especially in federated settings where model training can take days or weeks. In this work, we present a novel "one-shot" approach that can systematically address these challenges, allowing efficient auditing or estimation of the privacy loss of a model during the same, single training run used to fit model parameters, and without requiring any a priori knowledge about the model architecture, task, or DP algorithm. We show that our method provides provably correct estimates for the privacy loss under the Gaussian mechanism, and we demonstrate its performance on a well-established FL benchmark dataset under several adversarial threat models.},

Inspired by the success of large pretrained models in vision and language domains, we reframe the analysis of large-scale, cellular-resolution neuronal spiking data into an autoregressive spatiotemporal generation problem. Neuroformer is a multimodal, multitask generative pretrained transformer (GPT) model that is specifically designed to handle the intricacies of data in systems neuroscience. It scales linearly with feature size, can process an arbitrary number of modalities, and is adaptable to downstream tasks, such as predicting behavior. We first trained Neuroformer on simulated datasets, and found that it both accurately predicted simulated neuronal circuit activity, and also intrinsically inferred the underlying neural circuit connectivity, including direction. When pretrained to decode neural responses, the model predicted the behavior of a mouse with only few-shot fine-tuning, suggesting that the model begins learning how to do so directly from the neural representations themselves, without any explicit supervision. We used an ablation study to show that joint training on neuronal responses and behavior boosted performance, highlighting the model's ability to associate behavioral and neural representations in an unsupervised manner. These findings show that Neuroformer can analyze neural datasets and their emergent properties, informing the development of models and hypotheses associated with the brain.},

  abstract = {Attention-free language models that combine gating and convolutions are growing in popularity due to their efficiency and increasingly competitive performance. To better understand these architectures, we pretrain a suite of 17 attention and gated-convolution language models, finding that SoTA gated-convolution architectures still underperform attention by up to 2.1 perplexity points on the Pile. In fine-grained analysis, we find 82\% of the gap is explained by each model's ability to recall information that is previously mentioned in-context, e.g. ``Hakuna Matata means no worries Hakuna Matata it means no'' $\rightarrow$ ??. On this task, termed ``associative recall'', we find that attention outperforms gated-convolutions by a large margin: a 70M parameter attention model outperforms a 1.4 billion parameter gated-convolution model on associative recall. This is surprising because prior work shows gated convolutions can perfectly solve synthetic tests for AR capability. To close the gap between synthetics and real language, we develop a new formalization of the task called multi-query associative recall (MQAR) that better reflects actual language. We perform an empirical and theoretical study of MQAR that elucidates differences in the parameter-efficiency of attention and gated-convolution recall. Informed by our analysis, we evaluate simple convolution-attention hybrids and show that hybrids with input-dependent sparse attention patterns can close 97.4\% of the gap to attention, while maintaining sub-quadratic scaling.},

However, model scores are often not aligned with the true positivity rate. This is especially true when the training involves a differential sampling across classes or there is distributional drift between train and test settings. In this paper, we provide theoretical analysis and empirical evidence of the dependence of model score estimation bias on both uncertainty and score itself. Further, we formulate the decision boundary selection in terms of both model score and uncertainty, prove that it is NP-hard, and present algorithms based on dynamic programming and isotonic regression.

  abstract = {Despite their remarkable capabilities, large language models (LLMs) often produce responses containing factual inaccuracies due to their sole reliance on the parametric knowledge they encapsulate. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an ad hoc approach that augments LMs with retrieval of relevant knowledge, decreases such issues. However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number of retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are relevant, diminishes LM versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation. We introduce a new framework called Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Self-RAG) that enhances an LM's quality and factuality through retrieval and self-reflection. Our framework trains a single arbitrary LM that adaptively retrieves passages on-demand, and generates and reflects on retrieved passages and its own generations using special tokens, called reflection tokens. Generating reflection tokens makes the LM controllable during the inference phase, enabling it to tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments show that Self-RAG (7B and 13B parameters) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs and retrieval-augmented models on a diverse set of tasks. Specifically, Self-RAG outperforms ChatGPT and retrieval-augmented Llama2-chat on Open-domain QA, reasoning and fact verification tasks, and it shows significant gains in improving factuality and citation accuracy for long-form generations relative to these models.},

The dimensionality of the strokes is a design choice that allows the model to adapt to a range of complexities.

Sparsification provides a solution to alleviate these resource constraints, and recent works have shown that trained models can be sparsified post-hoc. Existing sparsification techniques face challenges as they need additional data structures and offer constrained speedup with current hardware. In this paper we present SliceGPT, a new post-training sparsification scheme which replaces each weight matrix with a smaller (dense) matrix, reducing the embedding dimension of the network. Through extensive experimentation we show that SliceGPT can remove up to 25\% of the model parameters (including embeddings) for LLAMA-2 70B, OPT 66B and Phi-2 models while maintaining 99\%, 99\% and 90\% zero-shot task performance of the dense model respectively. Our sliced models run on fewer GPUs and run faster without any additional code optimization: on 24GB consumer GPUs we reduce the total compute for inference on LLAMA-2 70B to 64\% of that of the dense model; on 40GB A100 GPUs we reduce it to 66\%. We offer a new insight, computational invariance in transformer networks, which enables SliceGPT and we hope it will inspire and enable future avenues to reduce memory and computation demands for pre-trained models.},

  abstract = {Integrating a notion of symmetry into point cloud neural networks is a provably effective way to improve their generalization capability. Of particular interest are E(3) equivariant point cloud networks where Euclidean transformations applied to the inputs are preserved in the outputs. Recent efforts aim to extend networks that are E(3) equivariant, to accommodate inputs made of multiple parts, each of which exhibits local E(3) symmetry. In practical settings, however, the partitioning into individually transforming regions is unknown a priori. Errors in the partition prediction would unavoidably map to errors in respecting the true input symmetry. To this end, we introduce APEN: a general framework for constructing approximate piecewise-E(3) equivariant point networks. Our framework offers an adaptable design to guaranteed bounds on the resulting piecewise E(3) equivariance approximation errors. Our primary insight is that functions which are equivariant with respect to a finer partition (compared to the unknown true partition) will also maintain equivariance in relation to the true partition. As a result, the equivariance approximation error can be bounded solely in terms of (i) uncertainty quantification of the partition prediction, and (ii) bounds on the probability of failing to suggest a proper subpartition of the ground truth one. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of APEN using two data types exemplifying part-based symmetry: (i) real-world scans of room scenes containing multiple furniture-type objects; and, (ii) human motions, characterized by articulated parts exhibiting rigid movement. Our empirical results demonstrate the advantage of integrating piecewise E(3) symmetry into network design, showing a distinct improvement in generalization accuracy compared to prior works for both classification and segmentation tasks.},

  abstract = {Convex relaxations are a key component of training and certifying provably safe neural networks. However, despite substantial progress, a wide and poorly understood accuracy gap to standard networks remains, raising the question of whether this is due to fundamental limitations of convex relaxations. Initial work investigating this question focused on the simple and widely used {IBP} relaxation. It revealed that some univariate, convex, continuous piecewise linear ({CPWL}) functions cannot be encoded by any {ReLU} network such that its {IBP}-analysis is precise. To explore whether this limitation is shared by more advanced convex relaxations, we conduct the first in-depth study on the expressive power of {ReLU} networks across all commonly used convex relaxations. We show that: (i) more advanced relaxations allow a larger class of univariate functions to be expressed as precisely analyzable {ReLU} networks, (ii) more precise relaxations can allow exponentially larger solution spaces of {ReLU} networks encoding the same functions, and (iii) even using the most precise single-neuron relaxations, it is impossible to construct precisely analyzable {ReLU} networks that express multivariate, convex, monotone {CPWL} functions.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in depthwise-separable convolutional neural networks ({DS-CNNs}) have led to novel architectures, that surpass the performance of classical {CNNs}, by a considerable scalability and accuracy margin. This paper reveals another striking property of {DS-CNN} architectures: discernible and explainable patterns emerge in their trained depthwise convolutional kernels in all layers. Through an extensive analysis of millions of trained filters, with different sizes and from various models, we employed unsupervised clustering with autoencoders, to categorize these filters. Astonishingly, the patterns converged into a few main clusters, each resembling the difference of {Gaussian} ({DoG}) functions, and their first and second-order derivatives. Notably, we were able to classify over 95\% and 90\% of the filters from state-of-the-art {ConvNextV2} and {ConvNeXt} models, respectively. This finding is not merely a technological curiosity; it echoes the foundational models neuroscientists have long proposed for the vision systems of mammals. Our results thus deepen our understanding of the emergent properties of trained {DS-CNNs} and provide a bridge between artificial and biological visual processing systems. More broadly, they pave the way for more interpretable and biologically-inspired neural network designs in the future.},

We consider a generalization of the classical (single-round) version of the problem in which the principal interacts with the agent by committing to contracts over multiple rounds. The principal has no information about the agent, and they have to learn an optimal contract by only observing the outcome realized at each round. We focus on settings where the size of the agent's action space is small, and we design an algorithm that learns an approximately-optimal contract with high probability in a number of rounds polynomial in the size of the outcome space, when the number of actions is constant. The algorithm solves an open problem by Zhu et al. (2022), and it can also provide a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{4/5})$ in the related online learning setting.},

We abstract out this common subroutine and study the following fundamental algorithmic problem: Given a similarity function $f$ and a large high-dimensional private dataset $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, output a differentially private ({DP}) data structure which approximates $\sum_{x \in X} f(x,y)$ for any query $y$. We consider the cases where $f$ is a kernel function, such as $f(x,y) = e^{-\|x-y\|_2^2/\sigma^2}$ (also known as {DP} kernel density estimation), or a distance function such as $f(x,y) = \|x-y\|_2$, among others. Our theoretical results improve upon prior work and give better privacy-utility trade-offs as well as faster query times for a wide range of kernels and distance functions. The unifying approach behind our results is leveraging `low-dimensional structures' present in the specific functions $f$ that we study, using tools such as provable dimensionality reduction, approximation theory, and one-dimensional decomposition of the functions. Our algorithms empirically exhibit improved query times and accuracy over prior state of the art. We also present an application to {DP} classification. Our experiments demonstrate that the simple methodology of classifying based on average similarity is orders of magnitude faster than prior {DP-SGD} based approaches for comparable accuracy.},

We propose good utilization of the transition matrix is crucial and suggest a new utilization method based on resampling, coined {RENT}. Specifically, we first demonstrate current utilizations can have potential limitations for implementation. As an extension to Reweighting, we suggest the {Dirichlet} distribution-based per-sample Weight Sampling ({DWS}) framework, and compare reweighting and resampling under {DWS} framework. With the analyses from {DWS}, we propose {RENT}, a REsampling method with Noise Transition matrix.

  abstract = {Sharpness-Aware Minimization ({SAM}) is most known for achieving state-of-the-art performances on natural image and language tasks. However, its most pronounced improvements (of tens of percent) is rather in the presence of label noise. Understanding {SAM}'s label noise robustness requires a departure from characterizing the robustness of minimas lying in ``flatter'' regions of the loss landscape. In particular, the peak performance under label noise occurs with early stopping, far before the loss converges. We decompose {SAM}'s robustness into two effects: one induced by changes to the logit term and the other induced by changes to the network Jacobian. The first can be observed in linear logistic regression where {SAM} provably up-weights the gradient contribution from clean examples. Although this explicit up-weighting is also observable in neural networks, when we intervene and modify {SAM} to remove this effect, surprisingly, we see no visible degradation in performance. This suggests that the network Jacobian effect is the major driver of {SAM}'s robustness.},

  abstract = {Training and deploying machine learning models that meet fairness criteria for protected groups are fundamental in modern artificial intelligence. While numerous constraints and regularization terms have been proposed in the literature to promote fairness in machine learning tasks, most of these methods are not amenable to stochastic optimization due to the complex and nonlinear structure of constraints and regularizers. Here, the term ``stochastic'' refers to the ability of the algorithm to work with small mini-batches of data. Motivated by the limitation of existing literature, this paper presents a unified stochastic optimization framework for fair empirical risk minimization based on f-divergence measures (f-{FERM}). The proposed stochastic algorithm enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees. In addition, our experiments demonstrate the superiority of fairness-accuracy tradeoffs offered by f-{FERM} for almost all batch sizes (ranging from full-batch to batch size of one). Moreover, we show that our framework can be extended to the case where there is a distribution shift from training to the test data. Our extension is based on a distributionally robust optimization reformulation of f-{FERM} objective under $L_p$ norms as uncertainty sets. Again, in this distributionally robust setting, f-{FERM} not only enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees but also outperforms other baselines in the literature in the tasks involving distribution shifts.},

However, {RLHF} is an unstable and data-hungry process that continually requires new high-quality {LM}-generated data for finetuning. We introduce Advantage-Leftover Lunch {RL} ({A-LoL}), a new class of offline policy gradient algorithms that enable {RL} training on any pre-existing data. By assuming the entire {LM} output sequence as a single action, {A-LoL} allows incorporating sequence-level classifiers or human-designed scoring functions as rewards. Subsequently, by using {LM}'s value estimate, {A-LoL} only trains on positive advantage (leftover) data points, making it resilient to noise. {A-LoL} is very easy to implement over standard cross entropy loss using two key improvements: (1) sequence-level advantage and (2) importance weight (ratio of target {LM}'s and initial reference {LM} probabilities). On the commonly-used {RLHF} benchmark, Helpful and Harmless Assistant ({HHA}), {LMs} trained with {A-LoL} methods achieve the highest diversity while also being rated more safe and helpful than the baselines according to humans.

In particular, our hyperspherical learning algorithm is guided by intra-class variation and inter-class separation principles -- ensuring that features from the same class (across different training domains) are closely aligned with their class prototypes, while different class prototypes are maximally separated.

  abstract = {Composed image retrieval ({CIR}) is the task of retrieving specific images by using a query that involves both a reference image and a relative caption. Most existing {CIR} models adopt the late-fusion strategy to combine visual and language features. Besides, several approaches have also been suggested to generate a pseudo-word token from the reference image, which is further integrated into the relative caption for {CIR}. However, these pseudo-word-based prompting methods have limitations when target image encompasses complex changes on reference image, e.g., object removal and attribute modification. In this work, we demonstrate that learning an appropriate sentence-level prompt for the relative caption ({SPRC}) is sufficient for achieving effective composed image retrieval. Instead of relying on pseudo-word-based prompts, we propose to leverage pretrained {V-L} models, e.g., {BLIP-2}, to generate sentence-level prompts. By concatenating the learned sentence-level prompt with the relative caption, one can readily use existing text-based image retrieval models to enhance {CIR} performance. Furthermore, we introduce both image-text contrastive loss and text prompt alignment loss to enforce the learning of suitable sentence-level prompts. Experiments show that our proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art {CIR} methods on the Fashion-IQ and {CIRR} datasets.},

Most existing methods devote the referring head to localize the referred object directly, causing failure in complex scenarios. In addition, it does not illustrate how and why the network reaches the final decision. In this paper, we address this question ``Can we design an interpretable {3D} visual grounding framework that has the potential to mimic the human perception system?''. To this end, we formulate the {3D} visual grounding problem as a sequence-to-sequence ({Seq2Seq}) task by first predicting a chain of anchors and then the final target. Interpretability not only improves the overall performance but also helps us identify failure cases. Following the chain of thoughts approach enables us to decompose the referring task into interpretable intermediate steps, boosting the performance and making our framework extremely data-efficient. Moreover, our proposed framework can be easily integrated into any existing architecture. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on the Nr3D, Sr3D, and Scanrefer benchmarks and show consistent performance gains compared to existing methods without requiring manually annotated data. Furthermore, our proposed framework, dubbed {CoT3DRef}, is significantly data-efficient, whereas on the Sr3D dataset, when trained only on 10\% of the data, we match the {SOTA} performance that trained on the entire data.},

@inproceedings{balachandar2024domain,
  abstract = {Machine learning models are often trained to predict the outcome resulting from a human decision. For example, if a doctor decides to test a patient for disease, will the patient test positive? A challenge is that historical decision-making determines whether the outcome is observed: we only observe test outcomes for patients doctors historically tested. Untested patients, for whom outcomes are unobserved, may differ from tested patients along observed and unobserved dimensions. We propose a Bayesian model class which captures this setting. The purpose of the model is to accurately estimate risk for both tested and untested patients. Estimating this model is challenging due to the wide range of possibilities for untested patients. To address this, we propose two domain constraints which are plausible in health settings: a prevalence constraint, where the overall disease prevalence is known, and an expertise constraint, where the human decision-maker deviates from purely risk-based decision-making only along a constrained feature set. We show theoretically and on synthetic data that domain constraints improve parameter inference. We apply our model to a case study of cancer risk prediction, showing that the model's inferred risk predicts cancer diagnoses, its inferred testing policy captures known public health policies, and it can identify suboptimalities in test allocation. Though our case study is in healthcare, our analysis reveals a general class of domain constraints which can improve model estimation in many settings.},

However, designing optimization layers requires careful consideration as the underlying optimization problems might be infeasible during training. Motivated by applications in learning, control and robotics, this work focuses on convex quadratic programming ({QP}) layers. The specific structure of this type of optimization layer can be efficiently exploited for faster computations while still allowing rich modeling capabilities. We leverage primal-dual augmented Lagrangian techniques for computing derivatives of both feasible and infeasible {QP} solutions. More precisely, we propose a unified approach which tackles the differentiability of the closest feasible {QP} solutions in a classical $\ell_2$ sense. We then harness this approach to enrich the expressive capabilities of existing {QP} layers. More precisely, we show how differentiating through infeasible {QPs} during training enables to drive towards feasibility at test time a new range of {QP} layers. These layers notably demonstrate superior predictive performance in some conventional learning tasks. Additionally, we present alternative formulations that enhance numerical robustness, speed, and accuracy for training such layers. Along with these contributions, we provide an open-source {C++} software package called {QPLayer} for differentiating feasible and infeasible convex {QPs} and which can be interfaced with modern learning frameworks.},

  abstract = {We study both stream-based and pool-based active learning with neural network approximations. A recent line of works proposed bandit-based approaches that transformed active learning into a bandit problem, achieving both theoretical and empirical success. However, the performance and computational costs of these methods may be susceptible to the number of classes, denoted as $K$, due to this transformation. Therefore, this paper seeks to answer the question: ``How can we mitigate the adverse impacts of $K$ while retaining the advantages of principled exploration and provable performance guarantees in active learning?'' To tackle this challenge, we propose two algorithms based on the newly designed exploitation and exploration neural networks for stream-based and pool-based active learning. Subsequently, we provide theoretical performance guarantees for both algorithms in a non-parametric setting, demonstrating a slower error-growth rate concerning $K$ for the proposed approaches. We use extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithms, which consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract = {In recent years numerous methods have been developed to formally verify the robustness of deep neural networks ({DNNs}). Though the proposed techniques are effective in providing mathematical guarantees about the {DNNs}' behavior, it is not clear whether the proofs generated by these methods are human-understandable. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing new concepts, algorithms, and representations to generate human understandable insights into the internal workings of {DNN} robustness proofs. Leveraging the proposed method, we show that the robustness proofs of standard {DNNs} rely more on spurious input features as compared to the proofs of {DNNs} trained to be robust. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the robustness proofs of provably robust {DNNs} filter out more spurious input features compared to adversarially trained {DNNs}, sometimes even leading to pruning of semantically meaningful input features. Finally, we show that the proofs for {DNNs} combining adversarial and provably robust training tend to achieve a middle ground between the two approaches.},

In this paper, we introduce the concept of conditional probability curvature to elucidate discrepancies in word choices between LLMs and humans within a given context. Utilizing this curvature as a foundational metric, we present Fast-DetectGPT, an optimized zero-shot detector, which substitutes DetectGPT's perturbation step with a more efficient sampling step.

We focus on two self-attention mechanisms: (1) {UHAT} (Unique Hard Attention Transformers) and (2) {AHAT} (Average Hard Attention Transformers). {UHAT} encoders are known to recognize only languages inside the circuit complexity class {$\mathsf{AC}^0$}, i.e., accepted by a family of poly-sized and depth-bounded boolean circuits with unbounded fan-ins. On the other hand, {AHAT} encoders can recognize languages outside {$\mathsf{AC}^0$}, but their expressive power still lies within the bigger circuit complexity class {$\mathsf{TC}^0$}, i.e., {$\mathsf{AC}^0$}-circuits extended by majority gates. We first show a negative result that there is an {$\mathsf{AC}^0$}-language that cannot be recognized by an {UHAT} encoder. On the positive side, we show that {UHAT} encoders can recognize a rich fragment of {$\mathsf{AC}^0$}-languages, namely, all languages definable in first-order logic with arbitrary unary numerical predicates. This logic, includes, for example, all regular languages from {$\mathsf{AC}^0$}. We then show that {AHAT} encoders can recognize all languages of our logic even when we enrich it with counting terms. Using these results, we obtain a characterization of which counting properties are expressible by {UHAT} and {AHAT}, in relation to regular languages.},

  abstract = {Text-to-Image Diffusion Models such as Stable-Diffusion and Imagen have achieved unprecedented quality of photorealism with state-of-the-art {FID} scores on {MS-COCO} and other generation benchmarks. Given a caption, image generation requires fine-grained knowledge about attributes such as object structure, style, and viewpoint amongst others. Where does this information reside in text-to-image generative models? In our paper, we tackle this question and understand how knowledge corresponding to distinct visual attributes is stored in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. We adapt Causal Mediation Analysis for text-to-image models and trace knowledge about distinct visual attributes to various (causal) components in the (i) {UNet} and (ii) text-encoder of the diffusion model. In particular, we show that unlike large-language models, knowledge about different attributes is not localized in isolated components, but is instead distributed amongst a set of components in the conditional {UNet}. These sets of components are often distinct for different visual attributes (e.g., style / objects). Remarkably, we find that the text-encoder in public text-to-image models such as Stable-Diffusion contains only one causal state across different visual attributes, and this is the first self-attention layer corresponding to the last subject token of the attribute in the caption. This is in stark contrast to the causal states in other language models which are often the mid-{MLP} layers. Based on this observation of only one causal state in the text-encoder, we introduce a fast, data-free model editing method {DiffQuickFix} which can effectively edit concepts (remove or update knowledge) in text-to-image models. {DiffQuickFix} can edit (ablate) concepts in under a second with a closed-form update, providing a significant 1000x speedup and comparable editing performance to existing fine-tuning based editing methods.},

However, {MPNNs} face challenges when modeling non-local interactions in systems such as large conjugated molecules, metals, or amorphous materials due to oversmoothing and oversquashing. Although Spectral {GNNs} and traditional neural networks such as recurrent neural networks and transformers mitigate these challenges, they often lack extensivity, adaptability, generalizability, computational efficiency, or fail to capture detailed structural relationships or symmetries in the data. This paper introduces Matrix Function Neural Networks ({MFNs}) as a novel approach that parameterizes non-local interactions through analytic matrix equivariant functions. Employing resolvent expansions offers a straightforward implementation and the potential for linear scaling with system size. The {MFN} architecture operates on equivariant matrix operators of graphs to capture non-local interactions effectively and achieves state-of-the-art performance in standard graph benchmarks, such as the {ZINC} and {TU} datasets, and is able to capture intricate non-local interactions in quantum systems, paving the way to new state-of-the-art force fields.},

This work presents seven novel datasets categorized by size into three distinct categories: {ToyMix}, {LargeMix} and {UltraLarge}, pushing the boundaries in both the scale and the diversity of supervised labels for molecular learning. The datasets cover nearly 100 million molecules and over 3000 sparsely defined tasks, totaling more than 13 billion individual labels of both quantum and biological nature. In comparison, these datasets contain 300 times more data points than the widely used {OGB-LSC} {PCQM4Mv2} dataset, and 13 times more than the quantum-only {QM1B} dataset. The authors also created the Graphium graph machine learning library to support multi-task learning on their proposed datasets.},

  abstract = {Stability guarantees are crucial when ensuring a fully autonomous robot does not take undesirable or potentially harmful actions. Unfortunately, global stability guarantees are hard to provide in dynamical systems learned from data, especially when the learned dynamics are governed by neural networks. This paper proposes a novel methodology to learn neural contractive dynamical systems, where their neural architecture ensures contraction, and hence, global stability. The paper introduces the Neural Contractive Dynamical System ({NCDS}), providing a flexible and stable approach for learning contractive dynamics. To efficiently scale the method to high-dimensional dynamical systems, the authors develop a variant of the variational autoencoder that learns dynamics in a low-dimensional latent representation space while retaining contractive stability after decoding. The approach extends to high-dimensional systems with obstacle avoidance capabilities.},

  abstract = {Based on the theory of homogeneous spaces, this paper derives geometrically optimal edge attributes to be used within the flexible message-passing framework and formalizes the notion of weight sharing in convolutional networks as the sharing of message functions over point-pairs that should be treated equally. The theory of homogeneous spaces tells us how to do group convolutions with feature maps over the homogeneous space of positions, position and orientations, and the group {SE}(3) itself. Among these, ℝ³×S² is an optimal choice due to the ability to represent directional information, which ℝ³ methods cannot, and it significantly enhances computational efficiency compared to indexing features on the full {SE}(3) group. As an application of the theory, the authors develop {PONITA}, an efficient equivariant group convolutional network for processing 3D point clouds with state-of-the-art results in accuracy and speed on five different benchmarks. {PONITA} is an equivariant model that does not require working with steerable/Clebsch-Gordan methods, but has the same capabilities in that it can handle scalars and vectors equally well, and is much faster than typical steerable/tensor field networks.},

The authors introduce {UnStereoEval} ({USE}), a novel framework tailored for investigating gender bias in stereotype-free scenarios. {USE} defines a sentence-level score based on pretraining data statistics to determine if sentences contain minimal word-gender associations. To systematically benchmark the fairness of popular language models in stereotype-free scenarios, they utilize {USE} to automatically generate benchmarks without any gender-related language. The results show that models demonstrate fair behavior in only 9--41\% of stereotype-free sentences, suggesting that bias does not solely stem from the presence of gender-related words. By leveraging {USE}'s sentence-level score, they also repurposed prior gender bias benchmarks (Winobias and Winogender) for non-stereotypical evaluation, revealing low fairness across all 28 evaluated models.},

Given that vector graphics are typically encoded using low-level graphics primitives, generating them directly is difficult. To address this, we propose the use of {TikZ}, a well-known abstract graphics language that can be compiled to vector graphics, as an intermediate representation of scientific figures. {TikZ} offers human-oriented, high-level commands, thereby facilitating conditional language modeling with any large language model. To this end, we introduce {DaTikZ} the first large-scale {TikZ} dataset, consisting of 120k {TikZ} drawings aligned with captions. We fine-tune {LLaMA} on {DaTikZ}, as well as our new model {CLiMA}, which augments {LLaMA} with multimodal {CLIP} embeddings. In both human and automatic evaluation, {CLiMA} and {LLaMA} outperform commercial {GPT-4} and {Claude} 2 in terms of similarity to human-created figures, with {CLiMA} additionally improving text-image alignment. Our detailed analysis shows that all models generalize well and are not susceptible to memorization. {GPT-4} and {Claude} 2, however, tend to generate more simplistic figures compared to both humans and our models.

Visual perception, in particular, can now be decoded from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({fMRI}) with remarkable fidelity. This neuroimaging technique, however, suffers from a limited temporal resolution ($\approx$0.5 {Hz}) and thus fundamentally constrains its real-time usage. Here, we propose an alternative approach based on magnetoencephalography ({MEG}), a neuroimaging device capable of measuring brain activity with high temporal resolution ($\approx$5,000 {Hz}). For this, we develop an {MEG} decoding model trained with both contrastive and regression objectives and consisting of three modules: i) pretrained embeddings obtained from the image, ii) an {MEG} module trained end-to-end and iii) a pretrained image generator. Our {MEG} decoder shows a 7X improvement of image-retrieval over classic linear decoders. Second, late brain responses to images are best decoded with {DINOv2}, a recent foundational image model. Third, image retrievals and generations both suggest that high-level visual features can be decoded from {MEG} signals, although the same approach applied to 7T {fMRI} also recovers better low-level features. Overall, these results, while preliminary, provide an important step towards the decoding -- in real-time -- of the visual processes continuously unfolding within the human brain.},

Hence, our model can effectively synthesize an unlimited speech duration while preserving high-fidelity synthesis and temporal coherence. {DiffAR} is an end-to-end model that directly works on the raw waveform without any intermediate representation such as the Mel-spectrogram. Specifically, it allows the creation of local acoustic behaviors, like vocal fry, which makes the overall waveform sounds more natural. Furthermore, the proposed diffusion model is stochastic and not deterministic; therefore, each inference generates a slightly different waveform variation, enabling abundance of valid realizations. It can operate in an unconditional mode, where no text is provided, or in a conditional mode, where text and other linguistic parameters are used as input. Experiments show that the proposed model generates speech with superior quality compared with other state-of-the-art neural speech generation systems.},

@inproceedings{benoit2024unraveling,
  abstract = {Supervised learning datasets may contain multiple cues that explain the training set equally well, i.e., learning any of them would lead to the correct predictions on the training data. However, many of them can be spurious, i.e., lose their predictive power under a distribution shift and consequently fail to generalize to out-of-distribution ({OOD}) data. Recently developed ``diversification'' methods approach this problem by finding multiple diverse hypotheses that rely on different features. In this paper, we study this class of methods and identify the key components contributing to their {OOD} generalization abilities. We show that diversification methods are highly sensitive to the distribution of the unlabeled data used for diversification and can underperform significantly when away from a method-specific sweet spot. We distill the critical design factors of current state-of-the-art methods and show that diversification alone is insufficient for {OOD} generalization. The choice of the used learning algorithm, e.g., the model's architecture and pretraining, is crucial. In standard experiments, using the second-best choice leads to an up to 20\% absolute drop in accuracy. Moreover, the optimal choice of learning algorithm depends on the unlabeled data and vice versa, i.e., they are co-dependent. The above pitfalls cannot be alleviated by increasing the number of diverse hypotheses, the major feature of diversification methods.},

We provide the first convergence bounds which are linear in the data dimension (up to logarithmic factors) assuming only finite second moments of the data distribution. We show that diffusion models require at most $\tilde{O}(\frac{d \log^2(1/\delta)}{\varepsilon^2})$ steps to approximate an arbitrary distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ corrupted with Gaussian noise of variance $\delta$ to within $\varepsilon^2$ in {KL} divergence.

If a model is trained on a sentence of the form ``A is B'', it will not automatically generalize to the reverse direction ``B is A''. This is the Reversal Curse. For instance, if a model is trained on ``Valentina Tereshkova was the first woman to travel to space'', it will not automatically be able to answer the question, ``Who was the first woman to travel to space?''. Moreover, the likelihood of the correct answer (``Valentina Tereshkova'') will not be higher than for a random name. We provide evidence for the Reversal Curse by finetuning {GPT-3} and {Llama-1} on fictitious statements such as ``Uriah Hawthorne is the composer of Abyssal Melodies'' and showing that they fail to correctly answer ``Who composed Abyssal Melodies?''. The Reversal Curse is robust across model sizes and model families and is not alleviated by data augmentation.

To overcome these issues, we introduce a method that generates a graph by progressively expanding a single node to a target graph. In each step, nodes and edges are added in a localized manner through denoising diffusion, building first the global structure, and then refining the local details. The local generation avoids modeling the entire joint distribution over all node pairs, achieving substantial computational savings with subquadratic runtime relative to node count while maintaining high expressivity. Drawing inspiration from natural growth patterns, we model graph generation as a progressive expansion process, starting from a single node and iteratively growing it to a complete graph. We present a new neural network architecture, Local {PPGN}, tailored to our approach to graph generation.},

Undeniably, a key driver of this success is enabled by the massive amounts of web-scale data consumed by these models. Due to these models' striking performance and ease of availability, the web will inevitably be increasingly populated with synthetic content. Such a fact directly implies that future iterations of generative models will be trained on both clean and artificially generated data from past models. In this paper, we develop a framework to rigorously study the impact of training generative models on mixed datasets -- from classical training on real data to self-consuming generative models trained on purely synthetic data. We first prove the stability of iterative training under the condition that the initial generative models approximate the data distribution well enough and the proportion of clean training data (w.r.t. synthetic data) is large enough. We empirically validate our theory on both synthetic and natural images by iteratively training normalizing flows and state-of-the-art diffusion models on {CIFAR-10} and {FFHQ}.},

This clipping process not only biases the direction of gradients but also proves costly both in memory consumption and in computation. To provide sensitivity bounds and bypass the drawbacks of the clipping process, we propose to rely on {L}ipschitz constrained networks. Our theoretical analysis reveals an unexplored link between the {L}ipschitz constant with respect to their input and the one with respect to their parameters. By bounding the {L}ipschitz constant of each layer with respect to its parameters, we prove that we can train these networks with privacy guarantees. Our analysis not only allows the computation of the aforementioned sensitivities at scale, but also provides guidance on how to maximize the gradient-to-noise ratio for fixed privacy guarantees. To facilitate the application of {L}ipschitz networks and foster robust and certifiable learning under privacy guarantees, we provide a Python package that implements building blocks allowing the construction and private training of such networks.},

However, existing methods still fall short in tasks like causal or compositional spatiotemporal reasoning over actions, in which model predictions need to be grounded in fine-grained low-level details, such as object motions and object interactions. In this work, we propose training an {LM} end-to-end on low-level surrogate tasks, including object detection, re-identification, and tracking, to endow the model with the required low-level visual capabilities. We show that a two-stream video encoder with spatiotemporal attention is effective at capturing the required static and motion-based cues in the video. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on four challenging video reasoning benchmarks: {ACRE}, {CATER}, Something-Else and {STAR}. Our method outperforms the prior state-of-the-art, that is based on highly task-specific architectures, by a large margin---highlighting how our general-purpose model can perform varied and complex spatiotemporal reasoning tasks in videos including causal, compositional and situated reasoning.},

  abstract = {In order to understand the in-context learning phenomenon, recent works have adopted a stylized experimental framework and demonstrated that Transformers can match the performance of gradient-based learning algorithms for various classes of real-valued functions. However, the limitations of Transformers in implementing learning algorithms, and their ability to learn other forms of algorithms are not well understood. Additionally, the degree to which these capabilities are confined to attention-based models is unclear. Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether the insights derived from these stylized settings can be extrapolated to pretrained Large Language Models ({LLM}s). In this work, we take a step towards answering these questions by demonstrating the following: (a) On a test-bed with a variety of Boolean function classes, we find that Transformers can nearly match the optimal learning algorithm for 'simpler' tasks, while their performance deteriorates on more 'complex' tasks. Additionally, we find that certain attention-free models perform (almost) identically to Transformers on a range of tasks. (b) When provided a *teaching sequence*, i.e. a set of examples that uniquely identifies a function in a class, we show that Transformers learn more sample-efficiently. Interestingly, our results show that Transformers can learn to implement *two distinct* algorithms to solve a *single* task, and can adaptively select the more sample-efficient algorithm depending on the sequence of in-context examples.},

  abstract = {Neural surface reconstruction is sensitive to the camera pose noise, even if state-of-the-art pose estimators like {COLMAP} or {ARK}it are used. More importantly, existing Pose-{NeRF} joint optimisation methods have struggled to improve pose accuracy in challenging real-world scenarios. To overcome the challenges, we introduce the pose residual field ({P}o{RF}), a novel implicit representation that uses an {MLP} for regressing pose updates. Compared with the conventional per-frame pose parameter optimisation, this new representation is more robust due to parameter sharing that leverages global information over the entire sequence. Furthermore, we propose an epipolar geometry loss to enhance the supervision that leverages the correspondences exported from {COLMAP} results without the extra computational overhead. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets show that our method significantly improves pose accuracy and surface reconstruction quality compared to previous joint optimisation methods.},

Yet, at the same time, these models often show unhuman-like characteristics. In the present paper, we address this gap and ask whether large language models can be turned into cognitive models. After finetuning them on data from psychological experiments, these models offer accurate representations of human behavior, even outperforming traditional cognitive models in two decision-making domains. Their representations contain the information necessary to model behavior on the level of individual subjects, and finetuning on multiple tasks enables large language models to predict human behavior in a previously unseen task. This suggests that large, pre-trained models can be adapted to become generalist cognitive models, thereby opening up new research directions that could transform cognitive psychology and the behavioral sciences as a whole.},

We then use the same robot data to train a low-level goal-conditioned policy to reach a given image observation. We find that when these components are combined, the resulting system exhibits robust generalization capabilities. The high-level planner utilizes its Internet-scale pre-training and visual understanding to guide the low-level goal-conditioned policy, achieving significantly better generalization than conventional language-conditioned policies.

We prove that with a careful choice of bandwidth, this method yields a calibration measure that is well-behaved in the sense of a consistent calibration measure. We call this measure the {SmoothECE}. Moreover, the reliability diagram obtained from this smoothed function visually encodes the {SmoothECE}, just as binned reliability diagrams encode the {BinnedECE}.

Our first result is a generalization bound for this class of predictors that depends on the regularity of the time series data. In a second time, we leverage the continuity of the flow of {CDEs} to provide a detailed analysis of both the sampling-induced bias and the approximation bias. Regarding this last result, we show how classical approximation results on neural nets may transfer to {NCDEs}.

We observe that minibatch {SGD} updates to the policy network during training result in sharp oscillations in long-horizon rewards, despite negligibly affecting the behavior cloning loss. We empirically disentangle the statistical and computational causes of these oscillations, and find them to stem from the chaotic propagation of minibatch {SGD} noise through unstable closed-loop dynamics. While {SGD} noise is benign in the single-step action prediction objective, it results in catastrophic error accumulation over long horizons, an effect we term gradient variance amplification ({GVA}). We demonstrate that many standard mitigation techniques do not alleviate {GVA}, but that taking an exponential moving average ({EMA}) of iterates is surprisingly effective at doing so. Furthermore, we illustrate the generality of the phenomenon by showing both the existence of {GVA} and its amelioration by {EMA} in autoregressive contexts, demonstrating that small fluctuations from minibatch {SGD} noise are amplified catastrophically in unstable feedback loops.},

We prove that for any relational reasoning task in a large family of tasks, transformers learn the abstract relations and generalize to the test set when trained by gradient descent on sufficiently large quantities of training data. For regression tasks, we prove that transformers generalize when trained, but require astonishingly large quantities of training data. For next-token-prediction tasks with symbolic labels, we show an inverse scaling law: transformers fail to generalize as their embedding dimension increases. We demonstrate that classical {MLP} architectures trained by {SGD} or {Adam} will not generalize in template tasks on symbols unseen during training, even in the regression setting, regardless of training data size. For both settings, we propose subtle transformer modifications which can reduce the amount of data needed by adding two trainable parameters per head.},

This is achieved with an efficient multi-scale function-space architecture that operates directly on raw sparse coordinates, coupled with a mollified diffusion process that smooths out irregularities. Through experiments on high-resolution datasets, we found that even at an $8\times$ subsampling rate, our model retains high-quality diffusion.

Therefore, we present {J}umanji, a suite of diverse {RL} environments specifically designed to be fast, flexible, and scalable. {J}umanji provides a suite of environments focusing on combinatorial problems frequently encountered in industry, as well as challenging general decision-making tasks. By leveraging the efficiency of {JAX} and hardware accelerators like {GPU}s and {TPU}s, {J}umanji enables rapid iteration of research ideas and large-scale experimentation, ultimately empowering more capable agents. Unlike existing {RL} environment suites, {J}umanji is highly customizable, allowing users to tailor the initial state distribution and problem complexity to their needs. Furthermore, we provide actor-critic baselines for each environment, accompanied by preliminary findings on scaling and generalization scenarios. {J}umanji aims to set a new standard for speed, adaptability, and scalability of {RL} environments.},

  abstract = {Most recent work in goal oriented visual navigation resorts to large-scale machine learning in simulated environments. The main challenge lies in learning compact representations generalizable to unseen environments and in learning high-capacity perception modules capable of reasoning on high-dimensional input. The latter is particularly difficult when the goal is not given as a category ('{O}bject{N}av') but as an exemplar image ('{I}mage{N}av'), as the perception module needs to learn a comparison strategy requiring to solve an underlying visual correspondence problem. This has been shown to be difficult from reward alone or with standard auxiliary tasks. We address this problem through a sequence of two pretext tasks, which serve as a prior for what we argue is one of the main bottleneck in perception, extremely wide-baseline relative pose estimation and visibility prediction in complex scenes. The first pretext task, cross-view completion is a proxy for the underlying visual correspondence problem, while the second task addresses goal detection and finding directly. We propose a new dual encoder with a large-capacity binocular {V}i{T} model and show that correspondence solutions naturally emerge from the training signals. Experiments show significant improvements and {SOTA} performance on the two benchmarks, {I}mage{N}av and the Instance-{I}mage{N}av variant, where camera intrinsics and height differ between observation and goal.},

@inproceedings{bono2024learning,
  abstract = {Agents navigating in 3{D} environments require some form of memory, which should hold a compact and actionable representation of the history of observations useful for decision taking and planning. In most end-to-end learning approaches the representation is latent and usually does not have a clearly defined interpretation, whereas classical robotics addresses this with scene reconstruction resulting in some form of map, usually estimated with geometry and sensor models and/or learning. In this work we propose to learn an actionable representation of the scene independently of the targeted downstream task and without explicitly optimizing reconstruction. The learned representation is optimized by a blind auxiliary agent trained to navigate with it on multiple short sub episodes branching out from a waypoint and, most importantly, without any direct visual observation. We argue and show that the blindness property is important and forces the (trained) latent representation to be the only means for planning. With probing experiments we show that the learned representation optimizes navigability and not reconstruction. On downstream tasks we show that it is robust to changes in distribution, in particular the sim2real gap, which we evaluate with a real physical robot in a real office building, significantly improving performance.},

Latent graph inference relies on latent geometric representations to dynamically rewire or infer a {GNN}'s graph to maximize the {GNN}'s predictive downstream performance, but it lacks solid theoretical foundations in terms of embedding-based representation guarantees. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a trainable deep learning architecture, coined neural snowflake, that can adaptively implement fractal-like metrics on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove that any given finite weights graph can be isometrically embedded by a standard {MLP} encoder. Furthermore, when the latent graph can be represented in the feature space of a sufficiently regular kernel, we show that the combined neural snowflake and {MLP} encoder do not succumb to the curse of dimensionality by using only a low-degree polynomial number of parameters in the number of nodes.},

Toward this goal, we introduce {F}old{F}low, a series of novel generative models of increasing modeling power based on the flow-matching paradigm over 3{D} rigid motions -- i.e. the group {SE}(3) -- enabling accurate modeling of protein backbones. We first introduce {F}old{F}low-Base, a simulation-free approach to learning deterministic continuous-time dynamics and matching invariant target distributions on {SE}(3). We next accelerate training by incorporating {R}iemannian optimal transport to create {F}old{F}low-{OT}, leading to the construction of both more simple and stable flows. Finally, we design {F}old{F}low-{SFM}, coupling both {R}iemannian {OT} and simulation-free training to learn stochastic continuous-time dynamics over {SE}(3). Our family of {F}old{F}low, generative models offers several key advantages over previous approaches to the generative modeling of proteins: they are more stable and faster to train than diffusion-based approaches, and our models enjoy the ability to map any invariant source distribution to any invariant target distribution over {SE}(3). Empirically, we validate {F}old{F}low, on protein backbone generation of up to 300 amino acids leading to high-quality designable, diverse, and novel samples.},

@inproceedings{bradley2024qualitydiversity,
  abstract = {In many text-generation problems, users may prefer not only a single response, but a diverse range of high-quality outputs from which to choose. Quality-diversity (QD) search algorithms aim at continually improving and diversifying a population of candidates. However, the applicability of QD to qualitative domains, like creative writing, has been limited by the difficulty of algorithmically specifying measures of quality and diversity. Leveraging recent developments in language models (LMs), we introduce Quality-Diversity through AI Feedback (QDAIF), wherein an evolutionary algorithm applies LMs to both generate variation and evaluate the quality and diversity of candidate text. Through experiments on creative writing domains, we demonstrate that QDAIF can effectively search for text that is both high-quality and diverse. Further, we show that techniques from the QD literature, such as archive-based search and illumination algorithms, can improve the effectiveness of search in creative domains. Our results suggest that QDAIF represents a step towards AI systems that can independently search, diversify, evaluate, and improve, which are traditionally human-driven processes.},

@inproceedings{brahman2024plasma,
  abstract = {Procedural planning, which entails decomposing a high-level goal into a sequence of temporally ordered steps, is an important yet intricate task for machines. It involves integrating common-sense knowledge to reason about complex and often contextualized situations, e.g. "scheduling a doctor's appointment without a phone". While current approaches show encouraging results using large language models ({LLM}s), they are hindered by drawbacks such as costly {API} calls and reproducibility issues. In this paper, we advocate planning using smaller language models. We present {PlaSma}, a novel two-pronged approach to endow small language models with procedural knowledge and (constrained) language planning capabilities. More concretely, we develop symbolic procedural knowledge distillation to enhance the commonsense knowledge in small language models and an inference-time algorithm to facilitate more structured and accurate reasoning. In addition, we introduce a new related task, Replanning, that requires a revision of a plan to cope with a constrained situation. In both the planning and replanning settings, we show that orders-of-magnitude smaller models (770{M}-11{B} parameters) can compete and often surpass their larger teacher models' capabilities. Finally, we showcase successful application of {PlaSma} in an embodied environment, {VirtualHome}.},

  abstract = {Temporal Difference ({TD}) algorithms are widely used in Deep Reinforcement Learning ({RL}). Their performance is heavily influenced by the size of the neural network. While in supervised learning, the regime of over-parameterization and its benefits are well understood, the situation in {RL} is much less clear. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of the influence of network size and $l_2$-regularization on performance. We identify the ratio between the number of parameters and the number of visited states as a crucial factor and define over-parameterization as the regime when it is larger than one. Furthermore, we observe a double descent phenomenon, i.e., a sudden drop in performance around the parameter/state ratio of one. Leveraging random features and the lazy training regime, we study the regularized Least-Square Temporal Difference ({LSTD}) algorithm in an asymptotic regime, as both the number of parameters and states go to infinity, maintaining a constant ratio. We derive deterministic limits of both the empirical and the true Mean-Squared Bellman Error ({MSBE}) that feature correction terms responsible for the double descent. Correction terms vanish when the $l_2$-regularization is increased or the number of unvisited states goes to zero. Numerical experiments with synthetic and small real-world environments closely match the theoretical predictions.},

  abstract = {We study a strategic variant of the multi-armed bandit problem, which we coin the strategic click-bandit. This model is motivated by applications in online recommendation where the choice of recommended items depends on both the click-through rates and the post-click rewards. Like in classical bandits, rewards follow a fixed unknown distribution. However, we assume that the click-rate of each arm is chosen strategically by the arm (e.g., a host on Airbnb) in order to maximize the number of times it gets clicked. The algorithm designer does not know the post-click rewards nor the arms' actions (i.e., strategically chosen click-rates) in advance, and must learn both values over time. To solve this problem, we design an incentive-aware learning algorithm, {UCB-S}, which achieves two goals simultaneously: (a) incentivizing desirable arm behavior under uncertainty; (b) minimizing regret by learning unknown parameters. We approximately characterize all Nash equilibria of the arms under {UCB-S} and show a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{KT})$ regret bound uniformly in every equilibrium. We also show that incentive-unaware algorithms generally fail to achieve low regret in the strategic click-bandit. Finally, we support our theoretical results by simulations of strategic arm behavior which confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed incentive design.},

  abstract = {Identifying cell types and understanding their functional properties is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms underlying perception and cognition. In the retina, functional types can be identified by carefully selected stimuli, but this requires expert domain knowledge and biases the procedure towards previously known cell types. In the visual cortex, it is still unknown what functional types exist and how to identify them. Thus, for unbiased identification of the functional cell types in retina and visual cortex, new approaches are needed. Here we propose an optimization-based clustering approach using deep predictive models to obtain functional clusters of neurons using Most Discriminative Stimuli ({MDS}). Our approach alternates between stimulus optimization with cluster reassignment akin to an expectation-maximization algorithm. The algorithm recovers functional clusters in mouse retina, marmoset retina and macaque visual area {V}4. This demonstrates that our approach can successfully find discriminative stimuli across species, stages of the visual system and recording techniques. The resulting most discriminative stimuli can be used to assign functional cell types fast and on the fly, without the need to train complex predictive models or show a large natural scene dataset, paving the way for experiments that were previously limited by experimental time. Crucially, {MDS} are interpretable: they visualize the distinctive stimulus patterns that most unambiguously identify a specific type of neuron.},

Its essence lies in tracking the dynamics of two mutual information ({MI}) values: between the hidden layer output and the {DNN} input/target. According to the hypothesis put forth by Shwartz-Ziv \& Tishby (2017), the training process consists of two distinct phases: fitting and compression. The latter phase is believed to account for the good generalization performance exhibited by {DNNs}. Due to the challenging nature of estimating {MI} between high-dimensional random vectors, this hypothesis was only partially verified for {NNs} of tiny sizes or specific types, such as quantized {NNs}. The paper addresses the key challenge of mutual information estimation in high-dimensional settings and proposes and justifies a lossy compression step to overcome the obstacles associated with high dimensionality in the information-theoretic approach to {DNNs}.},

Nonetheless, these architectures falter on tail labels with few representative samples. This phenomenon has been attributed to factors such as classifier over-fitting and missing label bias, and solutions involving regularization and loss re-calibration have been developed. This paper explores the impact of label variance -- a previously unexamined factor -- on the tail performance in extreme classifiers. It also develops a method to systematically reduce label variance in {XC} by transferring the knowledge from a specialized tail-robust teacher model to the {OvA} classifiers. We propose a principled knowledge distillation framework, {LEVER}, which enhances the tail performance in extreme classifiers with formal guarantees on generalization.},

@inproceedings{cacciamani2024online,
  abstract = {We investigate the mechanism design problem faced by a principal who hires multiple agents to gather and report costly information. Then, the principal exploits the information to make an informed decision. We model this problem as a game, where the principal announces a mechanism consisting in action recommendations and a payment function, a.k.a. scoring rule. Then, each agent chooses an effort level and receives partial information about an underlying state of nature based on the effort. Finally, the agents report the information (possibly non-truthfully), the principal takes a decision based on this information, and the agents are paid according to the scoring rule. While previous work focuses on single-agent problems, we consider multi-agents settings. The key challenges include coordinating agents' efforts and aggregating correlated information. The authors develop a polynomial-time algorithm to find an optimal incentive-compatible mechanism and design a no-regret algorithm with $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret.},

@inproceedings{cai2024large,
  abstract = {Recent research has highlighted the potential of large language models ({LLMs}) to improve their problem-solving capabilities with the aid of suitable external tools. In our work, we further advance this concept by introducing a closed-loop framework, referred to as {LLMs} As Tool Makers ({LATM}), where {LLMs} create their own reusable tools for problem-solving. Our approach consists of two phases: 1) tool making: an {LLM} acts as the tool maker that crafts tools for a set of tasks. 2) tool using: another {LLM} acts as the tool user, which applies the tool built by the tool maker for problem-solving. Recognizing that tool-making requires more sophisticated capabilities, we assign this task to a powerful, albeit resource-intensive, model. Conversely, the simpler tool-using phase is delegated to a lightweight model. This strategic division of labor allows the once-off cost of tool-making to be spread over multiple instances of tool-using, significantly reducing average costs while maintaining strong performance. We evaluate our approach across various complex reasoning tasks, including Big-Bench tasks. With {GPT}-4 as the tool maker and {GPT}-3.5 as the tool user, {LATM} demonstrates performance equivalent to using {GPT}-4 for both roles, but with a significantly reduced inference cost.},

Of particular relevance to these applications are methods targeting finite-sum structure, which generically arises in empirical variants of learning problems in these contexts. We study finite-sum monotone inclusion problems, which model broad classes of equilibrium problems. Such tasks are neatly unified under the umbrella of monotone inclusion, which has a rich history within optimization theory and operations research. The main contribution of this work is variants of the classical Halpern iteration that employ variance reduction to obtain improved complexity guarantees, specifically targeting scenarios where component operators are either cocoercive or Lipschitz continuous and monotone. We obtain the first variance-reduced complexity results for standard classes of monotone inclusion problems that can lead to a $\sqrt{n}$ improvement compared to methods without variance reduction.},

@inproceedings{cai2024independentset,
  abstract = {Interference is ubiquitous when conducting causal experiments over networks. Except for certain network structures, causal inference on the network in the presence of interference is difficult due to the entanglement between the treatment assignments and the interference levels. In this article, we conduct causal inference under interference on an observed, sparse, but connected network, and we propose a novel design of experiments based on an independent set. The independent-set design focuses on an independent subset of data and controls their interference exposures through the assignments to the rest (auxiliary set), which differs from conventional designs. We provide a lower bound on the size of the independent set from a greedy algorithm and justify the theoretical performance of estimators under the proposed design. The approach is capable of estimating both spillover effects and treatment effects. We justify its superiority over conventional methods and illustrate the empirical performance through simulations. Unlike most previous studies which require {SUTVA} assumptions and no interference between units, this approach does not require {SUTVA} and could be implemented in arbitrary networks.},

From a geometric perspective, identifying the classes of transformations and the related invariances that connect these representations is fundamental to unlocking applications, such as merging, stitching, and reusing different neural modules. We introduce a versatile method to directly incorporate a set of invariances into the representations, constructing a product space of invariant components on top of the latent representations without requiring prior knowledge about the optimal invariance to infuse. Using different similarity functions for each subspace, the method can infuse invariances to specific transformations into each component of the product space. We validate our solution on classification and reconstruction tasks, observing consistent latent similarity and downstream performance improvements in a zero-shot stitching setting. The experimental analysis comprises three modalities (vision, text, and graphs), twelve pretrained foundational models, nine benchmarks, and several architectures trained from scratch.},

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. We restrict phrases to contiguous sequences of words that correspond to constituent units in syntactic parse trees, ensuring that each phrase possesses a relatively complete and well-defined meaning. Experimental results show significant improvements: compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47\% to 36.27\% on {OpenbookQA}, and improves the {MAUVE} score from 42.61\% to 81.58\% in open-ended text generation. Our model also achieves the best performance and the lowest latency among several retrieval-augmented baselines, demonstrating that retrieval is more accurate generation.},

Leveraging the {ToM} for understanding others' mental states, our approach facilitates effective collaboration. We employ logic rules derived from observational data to infer human goals and guide human-like agents. These rules are treated as latent variables, and a rule encoder is trained alongside a multi-agent system in the robot's mind. We assess the posterior distribution of latent rules using learned embeddings, representing entities and relations, with confidence scores for each rule indicating their consistency with observed data. Finally, we employ a hierarchical reinforcement learning model with {ToM} to plan robot actions for assisting humans. The approach diverges from previous works by focusing on activity understanding that infers mental states (e.g., intentions, desires) from behaviors, aligning closely with computational Theory of Mind. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing human-{AI} collaboration across diverse collaborative scenarios.},

Despite its promise, existing entity segmentation methods like Segment Anything Model ({SAM}) rely heavily on costly expert annotators. To address this limitation, we introduce {SOHES}, a novel approach that eliminates the need for human annotations. {SOHES} operates in three phases: self-exploration, self-instruction, and self-correction. In the self-exploration phase, we cluster visual features from pre-trained {DINO} to generate initial pseudo-labels on unlabeled images. Then in the self-instruction phase, a segmentation model learns from the initial pseudo-labels. Finally, in the self-correction phase, we adopt a teacher-student framework to further refine the segmentation model. Beyond segmenting entities, {SOHES} also captures their constituent parts, providing a hierarchical understanding of visual entities. Using raw images as the sole training data, {SOHES} achieves unprecedented performance in self-supervised open-world segmentation. We evaluate {SOHES} on a variety of datasets, including {MS-COCO}, {LVIS}, {ADE20K}, {EntitySeg}, and {SA-1B}, demonstrating that {SOHES} significantly reduces the gap between self-supervised methods and the supervised Segment Anything Model.},

It is intriguing to explore whether {GPT}-type architectures can be effective for time series, capturing the intrinsic dynamic attributes and leading to significant accuracy improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, {TEMPO}, that can effectively learn time series representations.

To address limitations of basic resampling methods, we propose implicit representation-driven image resampling ({IRAD}). The method involves constructing an implicit continuous representation that enables us to represent any input image within a continuous coordinate space, and introducing {SampleNet}, which automatically generates pixel-wise shifts for resampling in response to different inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the adversarial robustness of diverse deep models against various attacks while maintaining high accuracy on clean images.},

This paper investigates how the choice of computational method significantly impacts control performance. We draw parallels between {IntRL}'s policy iteration and Newton's method applied to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, showing that computational error in policy evaluation creates additional error terms in each iteration. When the utility function exists in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space ({RKHS}), we demonstrate that optimal quadrature is achievable using Bayesian quadrature with the {RKHS}-inducing kernel function. We provide convergence rate analysis for {IntRL} using both trapezoidal rule and Bayesian quadrature with Matérn kernels. Results from canonical control tasks show that larger sample sizes reduce accumulated costs, with notable differences between quadrature methods.},

  abstract = {Driven by the appealing properties of neural fields for storing and communicating 3D data, the problem of directly processing them to address tasks such as classification and part segmentation has emerged and has been investigated in recent works. Early approaches employ neural fields parameterized by shared networks trained on the whole dataset, achieving good task performance but sacrificing reconstruction quality. To improve the latter, later methods focus on individual neural fields parameterized as large Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), which are, however, challenging to process due to the high dimensionality of the weight space, intrinsic weight space symmetries, and sensitivity to random initialization. Hence, results turn out significantly inferior to those achieved by processing explicit representations, e.g., point clouds or meshes. In this work, we introduce an approach to process neural fields encoded through tri-planar hybrid representations. While processing a field with the same reconstruction quality, we achieve task performance far superior to frameworks that process large MLPs and, for the first time, almost on par with architectures handling explicit representations.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in open domain text generation have been spearheaded by Transformer-based large language models. Leveraging efficient parallelization and vast training datasets, these models achieve unparalleled text generation capabilities. However, current models are known to suffer from deficiencies such as repetitive texts, looping issues, and lack of robustness. Adversarial training through generative adversarial networks (GANs) is a proposed solution, but earlier research in this direction has predominantly focused on older architectures or narrow tasks. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient GAN approach for sequential data that utilizes the parallelization capabilities of Transformer models. Our method generates multiple branching sequences from each training sample, while incorporating typical next-step prediction loss on original data. This approach results in dense reward and loss signal for both generator and discriminator, leading to stable training dynamics. We apply our method to pre-trained language models using less than 0.01% of their original training data, and comprehensive human evaluation shows significant improvements in text quality while avoiding previously reported sparsity problems of GAN approaches.},

  abstract = {We introduce the Brain Language Model ({BrainLM}), a foundation model for brain activity dynamics trained on 6,700 hours of {fMRI} recordings. Utilizing self-supervised masked-prediction training, {BrainLM} demonstrates proficiency in both fine-tuning and zero-shot inference tasks. Fine-tuning allows for the accurate prediction of clinical variables like age, anxiety, and {PTSD} as well as forecasting of future brain states. Critically, the model generalizes well to entirely new external cohorts not seen during training. In zero-shot inference mode, {BrainLM} can identify intrinsic functional networks directly from raw {fMRI} data without any network-based supervision during training. The model also generates interpretable latent representations that reveal relationships between brain activity patterns and cognitive states. Overall, {BrainLM} offers a versatile and interpretable framework for elucidating the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of human brain activity. It serves as a powerful `lens' through which massive repositories of {fMRI} data can be analyzed in new ways, enabling more effective interpretation and utilization at scale. The work demonstrates the potential of foundation models to advance computational neuroscience research.},

  abstract = {Recent works have introduced {LEAPS} and {HPRL}, systems that learn latent spaces of domain-specific languages, which are used to define programmatic policies for partially observable Markov decision processes ({POMDPs}). These systems induce a latent space while optimizing losses such as the behavior loss, which aim to achieve locality in program behavior, meaning that vectors close in the latent space should correspond to similarly behaving programs. In this paper, we show that the programmatic space, induced by the domain-specific language and requiring no training, presents values for the behavior loss similar to those observed in latent spaces presented in previous work. Moreover, algorithms searching in the programmatic space significantly outperform those in {LEAPS} and {HPRL}. We show that algorithms are more likely to stop at local maxima when searching in the latent space than when searching in the programmatic space. This implies that the optimization topology of the programmatic space, induced by the reward function in conjunction with the neighborhood function, is more conducive to search than that of the latent space.},

  abstract = {Exploration bonuses in reinforcement learning guide long-horizon exploration by defining custom intrinsic objectives. Several exploration objectives like count-based bonuses, pseudo-counts, and state-entropy maximization are non-stationary and hence are difficult to optimize for the agent. While this issue is generally known, it is usually omitted and solutions remain under-explored. The key contribution of our work lies in transforming the original non-stationary rewards into stationary rewards through an augmented state representation. For this purpose, we introduce the Stationary Objectives For Exploration ({SOFE}) framework. {SOFE} requires identifying sufficient statistics for different exploration bonuses and finding an efficient encoding of these statistics to use as input to a deep network. {SOFE} is based on proposing state augmentations that expand the state space but hold the promise of simplifying the optimization of the agent's objective. We show that {SOFE} improves the performance of several exploration objectives, including count-based bonuses, pseudo-counts, and state-entropy maximization. Moreover, {SOFE} outperforms prior methods that attempt to stabilize the optimization of intrinsic objectives. We demonstrate the efficacy of {SOFE} in hard-exploration problems, including sparse-reward tasks, pixel-based observations, {3D} navigation, and procedurally generated environments.},

In this paper, we propose a novel training algorithm called Conservative Density Estimation ({CDE}), which addresses this challenge by explicitly imposing constraints on the state-action occupancy stationary distribution. {CDE} overcomes the limitations of existing approaches, such as the stationary distribution correction method, by addressing the support mismatch issue in marginal importance sampling. {CDE} integrates the strengths of both pessimism-based and {DICE}-based approaches, employing the principles of conservative {Q}-learning in a unique way, incorporating pessimism within the stationary distribution space to achieve a theoretically-backed conservative occupation distribution. {CDE} does not rely on Bellman update-style value estimation, favoring a direct behavior-policy-agnostic stationary distribution correction that improves performance in sparse reward scenarios.},

  abstract = {Wasserstein Autoencoders ({WAEs}) are a variant of Variational Autoencoders ({VAEs}) that aim to improve model efficiency and interpretability. However, there has been limited focus on analyzing their statistical guarantees. The matter is further complicated by the fact that the data distributions to which {WAEs} are applied -- such as natural images -- are often presumed to possess an underlying low-dimensional structure within a high-dimensional feature space, which current theory does not adequately account for, rendering known bounds inefficient. In this paper, we show that one can ensure encoding and decoding guarantees, where the encoded distribution is close enough to the target latent distribution, and the generator maps back the encoded points close to the original points. Under additional regularity assumptions, we demonstrate that the approximating push-forward measure induced by the generator is close to the target distribution in the Wasserstein sense. We show that {WAE}s can achieve an excess risk that, as a function of the number of samples, depends only on the intrinsic data dimensions rather than the high dimensions of the ambient feature-space. Our theoretical results show that error rates for {WAEs} depend primarily on the intrinsic dimension of the data, providing fundamental insights into their performance on intrinsically low-dimensional data.},

  abstract = {Policy alignment in reinforcement learning is essential for ensuring that agents behave according to human preferences and values. However, existing algorithmic designs suffer from a major gap due to a lack of precise characterization of the dependence of the alignment objective on the data generated by policy trajectories. This shortfall contributes to the sub-optimal performance observed in contemporary algorithms. In this paper, we present {PARL}, a novel unified bilevel optimization-based framework formulated to address the critical issue of policy alignment in reinforcement learning using utility or preference-based feedback. The framework addresses these concerns by explicitly parameterizing the distribution of the upper alignment objective (reward design) by the lower optimal variable (optimal policy for the designed reward). From an optimization perspective, this formulation leads to a new class of stochastic bilevel problems where the stochasticity at the upper objective depends upon the lower-level variable. This work presents the first formulation of {RLHF} as a bilevel optimization problem which generalizes existing {RLHF} formulations and addresses distribution shift issues. We devise an algorithm named {A-PARL} to solve the {PARL} problem, establishing sample complexity bounds of order {O}(1/T). Empirical results demonstrate that {PARL} can address alignment concerns in {RL} with significant improvements (up to 63\% in terms of required samples) for policy alignment in large-scale environments.},

The same sparse {HRSNN} model can be trained for different tasks, such as image classification and time-series prediction. {LNP} increases computational efficiency (fewer neurons and synapses) and prediction performance of {RSNNs} compared to traditional activity-based pruning of trained dense models. This task-agnostic pruning strategy ensures the pruned network remains stable and effective across various applications without the need for extensive retraining.},

While such constraints can be softly imposed via loss function penalties, recent advancements in differentiable physics and optimization improve performance by incorporating {PDE}-constrained optimization as individual layers in neural networks, which enables a stricter adherence to physical constraints. However, imposing hard constraints significantly increases computational and memory costs, especially for complex dynamical systems. We develop a scalable approach to enforce hard physical constraints using Mixture-of-Experts ({MoE}), which imposes the constraint over smaller decomposed domains, each solved by an `expert' through differentiable optimization. Compared to standard differentiable optimization, our scalable approach achieves greater accuracy in the neural {PDE} solver setting for predicting the dynamics of challenging non-linear systems. Our method can scale to more complex systems while maintaining computational efficiency and physical accuracy.},

With the emergence of large language models ({LLMs}), researchers have explored {LLMs}' potential as alternatives for human evaluation. While these single-agent-based approaches show promise, experimental results suggest that further advancements are needed to bridge the gap between their current effectiveness and human-level evaluation quality. Recognizing that best practices of human evaluation processes often involve multiple human annotators collaborating in the evaluation, we resort to a multi-agent debate framework, moving beyond single-agent prompting strategies. We construct a multi-agent referee team called {ChatEval} to autonomously discuss and evaluate the quality of generated responses from different models on open-ended questions and traditional natural language generation ({NLG}) tasks. Experiments on two benchmarks illustrate that {ChatEval} delivers superior accuracy and correlation in alignment with human assessment. The diverse role prompts (different personas) are essential in the multi-agent debate process; utilizing the same role description in the prompts can lead to a degradation in performance. Our qualitative analysis shows that {ChatEval} transcends mere textual scoring, offering a human-mimicking evaluation process for reliable assessments.},

To enhance the capabilities of most model-homogeneous FL methods in handling system heterogeneity, we propose a training scheme that can extend their capabilities to cope with this challenge. In this paper, we commence our study with a detailed exploration of homogeneous and heterogeneous FL settings and discover three key observations: (1) a positive correlation between client performance and layer similarities, (2) higher similarities in the shallow layers in contrast to the deep layers, and (3) the smoother gradients distributions indicate the higher layer similarities. Building upon these observations, we propose InCo Aggregation that leverages internal cross-layer gradients, a mixture of gradients from shallow and deep layers within a server model, to augment the similarity in the deep layers without requiring additional communication between clients. Furthermore, our methods can be tailored to accommodate model-homogeneous FL methods such as FedAvg, FedProx, FedNova, Scaffold, and MOON, to expand their capabilities to handle the system heterogeneity. Copious experimental results validate the effectiveness of InCo Aggregation, spotlighting internal cross-layer gradients as a promising avenue to enhance the performance in heterogeneous FL.},

To address this issue we propose CORESET-PFEDBAYES : a personalized coreset weighted federated learning setup where the training updates for each individual clients are forwarded to the central server based on only individual client coreset based representative data points instead of the entire client data. Through theoretical analysis we present how the average generalization error is minimax optimal up to logarithm bounds (upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}(n_k^{-\frac{2 \beta}{2 \beta+\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}} \log ^{2 \delta^{\prime}}(n_k))$) and lower bounds of $\mathcal{O}(n_k^{-\frac{2 \beta}{2 \beta+\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}})$, and how the overall generalization error on the data likelihood differs from a vanilla Federated Learning setup as a closed form function ${\boldsymbol{\Im}}(\boldsymbol{w}, n_k)$ of the coreset weights $\boldsymbol{w}$ and coreset sample size $n_k$. Our experiments on different benchmark datasets based on a variety of recent personalized federated learning architectures show significant gains as compared to random sampling on the training data followed by federated learning, thereby indicating how intelligently selecting such training samples can help in performance.

However, the sample efficiency of such estimators depends not only on the inherent variability in outcomes but also on the varying compliance levels of users with the instrumental variables and the choice of estimator being used, especially when dealing with numerous instrumental variables. While adaptive experiment design has a rich literature for \textit{direct} experiments, in this paper we take the initial steps towards enhancing sample efficiency for \textit{indirect} experiments by adaptively designing a data collection policy over instrumental variables. Our main contribution is a practical computational procedure that utilizes influence functions to search for an optimal data collection policy, minimizing the mean-squared error of the desired (non-linear) estimator.

  abstract = {Summarizing book-length documents (>100K tokens) that exceed the context window size of large language models (LLMs) requires first breaking the input document into smaller chunks and then prompting an LLM to merge, update, and compress chunk-level summaries. Despite the complexity and importance of this task, it has yet to be meaningfully studied due to the challenges of evaluation: existing book-length summarization datasets (e.g., BookSum) are in the pretraining data of most public LLMs, and existing evaluation methods struggle to capture errors made by modern LLM summarizers. In this paper, we present the first study of the coherence of LLM-based book-length summarizers implemented via two prompting workflows: (1) hierarchically merging chunk-level summaries, and (2) incrementally updating a running summary. We obtain 1193 fine-grained human annotations on GPT-4 generated summaries of 100 recently-published books and identify eight common types of coherence errors made by LLMs. Because human evaluation is expensive and time-consuming, we develop an automatic metric, BooookScore, that measures the proportion of sentences in a summary that do not contain any of the identified error types. BooookScore has high agreement with human annotations and allows us to systematically evaluate the impact of many other critical parameters (e.g., chunk size, base LLM) while saving $15K USD and 500 hours in human evaluation costs. We find that closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 and Claude 2 produce summaries with higher BooookScore than those generated by open-source models. While LLaMA 2 falls behind other models, Mixtral achieves performance on par with GPT-3.5-Turbo. Incremental updating yields lower BooookScore but higher level of detail than hierarchical merging, a trade-off sometimes preferred by annotators. We release code and annotations to spur more principled research on book-length summarization.},

Despite DAC's empirical success, the original AIL objective is on-policy and DAC's ad-hoc application of off-policy training does not guarantee successful imitation. Follow-up work such as ValueDICE tackles this issue by deriving a fully off-policy AIL objective. Instead in this work, we develop a novel and principled AIL algorithm via the framework of boosting. Like boosting, our new algorithm, AILBoost, maintains an ensemble of weighted weak learners (i.e., policies) and trains a discriminator that witnesses the maximum discrepancy between the distributions of the ensemble and the expert policy. We maintain a weighted replay buffer to represent the state-action distribution induced by the ensemble, allowing us to train discriminators using the entire data collected so far. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm on both controller state-based and pixel-based environments from the DeepMind Control Suite. AILBoost outperforms DAC on both types of environments, demonstrating the benefit of properly weighting replay buffer data for off-policy training. On state-based environments, AILBoost outperforms ValueDICE and IQ-Learn, achieving state-of-the-art performance with as little as one expert trajectory.},

  abstract = {Video editing and generation methods often rely on pre-trained image-based diffusion models. During the diffusion process, however, the reliance on rudimentary noise sampling techniques that do not preserve correlations present in subsequent frames of a video is detrimental to the quality of the results. This either produces high-frequency flickering, or texture-sticking artifacts that are not amenable to post-processing. With this in mind, we propose a novel method for preserving temporal correlations in a sequence of noise samples. This approach is materialized by a novel noise representation, dubbed $\int$-noise (integral noise), that reinterprets individual noise samples as a continuously integrated noise field: pixel values do not represent discrete values, but are rather the integral of an underlying infinite-resolution noise over the pixel area. Additionally, we propose a carefully tailored transport method that uses $\int$-noise to accurately advect noise samples over a sequence of frames, maximizing the correlation between different frames while also preserving the noise properties. Our results demonstrate that the proposed $\int$-noise can be used for a variety of tasks, such as video restoration, surrogate rendering, and conditional video generation.},

As training proceeds, the model learns a list $\mathcal D$ of integers, products of divisors of the base used to represent integers and small primes, and predicts the largest element of $\mathcal D$ that divides both inputs. Training distributions impact performance. Models trained from uniform operands only learn a handful of GCD (up to $38$ GCD $\leq100$). Log-uniform operands boost performance to $73$ GCD $\leq 100$, and a log-uniform distribution of outcomes (i.e. GCD) to $91$. However, training from uniform (balanced) GCD breaks explainability.},

  abstract = {Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP) is an interpretable-by-design framework that makes predictions by sequentially selecting a short chain of user-defined, interpretable queries about the data that are most informative for the task. The prediction is based solely on the obtained query answers, which also serve as a faithful explanation for the prediction. Applying the framework to any task requires (i) specification of a query set, and (ii) densely annotated data with query answers to train classifiers to answer queries at test time. This limits V-IP's application to small-scale tasks where manual data annotation is feasible. In this work, we focus on image classification tasks and propose to relieve this bottleneck by leveraging pretrained language and vision models. Specifically, following recent work, we propose to use GPT, a Large Language Model, to propose semantic concepts as queries for a given classification task. To answer these queries, we propose a light-weight Concept Question-Answering network (Concept-QA) which learns to answer binary queries about semantic concepts in images. We design pseudo-labels to train our Concept-QA model using GPT and CLIP (a Vision-Language Model). Empirically, we find our Concept-QA model to be competitive with state-of-the-art VQA models in terms of answering accuracy but with an order of magnitude fewer parameters. This allows for seamless integration of Concept-QA into the V-IP framework as a fast-answering mechanism. We name this method Concept-QA+V-IP. Finally, we show on several datasets that Concept-QA+V-IP produces shorter, interpretable query chains which are more accurate than V-IP trained with CLIP-based answering systems.},

  abstract = {Synthetic data (Sim) drawn from simulators have emerged as a popular alternative for training models where acquiring annotated real-world images is difficult. However, transferring models trained on synthetic images to real-world applications can be challenging due to appearance disparities. A commonly employed solution to counter this Sim2Real gap is unsupervised domain adaptation, where models are trained using labeled Sim data and unlabeled Real data. Mispredictions made by such Sim2Real adapted models are often associated with miscalibration – stemming from overconfident predictions on real data. In this paper, we introduce AUGCAL, a simple training-time patch for unsupervised adaptation that improves Sim2Real adapted models by – (1) reducing overall miscalibration, (2) reducing overconfidence in incorrect predictions and (3) improving confidence score reliability by better guiding misclassification detection – all while retaining or improving Sim2Real performance. Given a base Sim2Real adaptation algorithm, at training time, AUGCAL involves replacing vanilla Sim images with strongly augmented views (AUG intervention) and additionally optimizing for a training time calibration loss on augmented Sim predictions (CAL intervention). We motivate AUGCAL using a brief analytical justification of how to reduce miscalibration on unlabeled REAL data. Through our experiments, we empirically show the efficacy of AUGCAL across multiple adaptation methods, backbones, tasks and shifts.},

One such privacy risk is Membership Inference (MI), in which an adversary seeks to determine whether a particular data point was included in the training dataset of a model. Current state-of-the-art MI approaches capitalize on access to the model's predicted confidence scores to successfully perform membership inference, and employ data poisoning to further enhance their effectiveness. In this work, we focus on the less explored and more realistic label-only setting, where the model provides only the predicted label as output. We show that existing label-only attacks are ineffective at inferring membership in the low False Positive Rate (FPR) regime. To address this challenge, we propose a new attack Chameleon that leverages a novel data poisoning strategy and an efficient query selection method to achieve significantly more accurate membership inference than existing label-only attacks, especially for low FPRs.},

We show that a provably optimal and sample-efficient way of learning conditional invariances is by relaxing the invariance criterion to be non-commutatively directed towards the target domain. Under domain asymmetry, i.e., when the target domain contains semantically relevant information absent in the source, the risk of the encoder φ* that is optimal on average across domains is strictly lower-bounded by the risk of the target-specific optimal encoder Φ*_τ. We prove that non-commutativity steers the optimization towards Φ*_τ instead of φ*, bringing the H-divergence between domains down to zero, leading to a stricter bound on the target risk. Both our theory and experiments demonstrate that non-commutative invariance (NCI) can leverage source domain samples to meet the sample complexity needs of learning Φ*_τ, surpassing SOTA invariance learning algorithms for domain adaptation, at times by over 2%, approaching the performance of an oracle.},

(2023) recently showed how to use first-order gradient methods to solve general variational inequalities (VIs) under a limiting assumption that analytic solutions of specific subproblems are available. In this paper, we circumvent this assumption via a warm-starting technique where we solve subproblems approximately and initialize variables with the approximate solution found at the previous iteration. We prove the convergence of this method and show that the gap function of the last iterate of the method decreases at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}})$ when the operator is $L$-Lipschitz and monotone. In numerical experiments, we show that this technique can converge much faster than its exact counterpart. Furthermore, for the cases when the inequality constraints are simple, we introduce an alternative variant of ACVI and establish its convergence under the same conditions. Finally, we relax the smoothness assumptions in Yang et al., yielding, to our knowledge, the first convergence result for VIs with general constraints that does not rely on the assumption that the operator is $L$-Lipschitz.},

  abstract = {Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to generate high-quality, diverse images from a textual prompt. However, the internal representations learned by these models remain an enigma. In this work, we propose Conceptor, a novel method to interpret the internal representation of a textual concept by a diffusion model. This interpretation is obtained by decomposing the concept into a small set of human-interpretable textual elements. This decomposition is derived by learning a pseudo-token that is a sparse weighted combination of tokens from the model's vocabulary, with the objective of reconstructing the images generated for the given concept. Applied over the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion model, this decomposition reveals non-trivial and surprising structures in the representations of concepts. For example, some concepts such as "a president" or "a composer" are dominated by specific instances (e.g., "Obama", "Biden") and their interpolations. Other concepts, such as "happiness" combine associated terms that can be concrete ("family", "laughter") or abstract ("friendship", "emotion"). In addition to peering into the inner workings of Stable Diffusion, our method also enables applications such as single-image decomposition to tokens, bias detection and mitigation, and semantic image manipulation.},

Lion achieves results comparable to AdamW but with greater memory efficiency. However, the theoretical basis of Lion remained unclear. In this paper, we show that Lion is performing a constrained optimization and the key design choices of Lion are equivalent to performing a Hamiltonian mirror descent. Using both continuous-time and discrete-time analysis, we demonstrate that Lion is a theoretically grounded approach for minimizing a general loss function f(x) while enforcing a bound constraint ||x||_∞ ≤ 1/λ. Lion achieves this through the incorporation of decoupled weight decay, where λ represents the weight decay coefficient. The analysis is facilitated by the development of a new Lyapunov function for the Lion updates. This analysis applies to a wide range of Lion-φ algorithms, where the sign(·) operator in Lion is replaced by the subgradient of a convex function φ, leading to the solution of the general composite optimization problem min_x f(x) + φ*(x). Our findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Lion and pave the way for further enhancements and extensions of Lion-related algorithms.},

In this work, we investigate scaled ResNet in the limit of infinitely deep and wide neural networks, of which the gradient flow is described by a partial differential equation in the large-neural network limit, i.e., the mean-field regime. To derive the generalization bounds under this setting, our analysis necessitates a shift from the conventional time-invariant Gram matrix employed in the lazy training regime to a time-variant, distribution-dependent version. To this end, we provide a global lower bound on the minimum eigenvalue of the Gram matrix under the mean-field regime. Besides, for the traceability of the dynamic of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, we establish the linear convergence of the empirical error and estimate the upper bound of the KL divergence over parameters distribution. Finally, we build the uniform convergence for generalization bound via Rademacher complexity. Our results offer new insights into the generalization ability of deep ResNet beyond the lazy training regime and contribute to advancing the understanding of the fundamental properties of deep neural networks.},

Position Embedding (PE) scaling methods, while effective in extending the context window to a specific length, demonstrate either notable limitations in their extrapolation abilities or sacrificing partial performance within the context window. To address these challenges, we propose Continuous Length EXtrapolation (CLEX) for LLMs. We generalise the PE scaling approaches to model the continuous dynamics by ordinary differential equations over the length scaling factor, thereby overcoming the constraints of current PE scaling methods designed for specific lengths. We can seamlessly incorporate CLEX into LLMs equipped with Rotary Position Embedding, such as LLaMA and GPT-NeoX, with negligible impact on training and inference latency. Experimental results reveal that CLEX can effectively extend the context window to over 4x or almost 8x training length, with no deterioration in performance. Furthermore, when evaluated on the practical LongBench benchmark, our model trained on a 4k length exhibits competitive performance against state-of-the-art open-source models trained on context lengths up to 32k.},

In some situations, target data labels may be expensive to obtain, so we may only have access to a limited number of target data points. To make the most of a very small target dataset, we propose Project and Probe (Pro²), a lightweight, sample-efficient approach that learns a diverse set of predictive features and adapts to a target distribution by interpolating among them with a small target dataset. Specifically, Pro² first learns a linear projection that maps a pre-trained embedding onto orthogonal directions while being predictive of labels in the source dataset. The goal of this step is to learn a variety of predictive features, so that at least some of them remain useful after distribution shift. Pro² then learns a linear classifier on top of these projected features using a small target dataset. Theoretically, we find that Pro² adapts to a target distribution by interpolating among source features rather than extrapolating far from the source distribution, and we show conditions under which Pro² recovers the optimal target classifier. Empirically, we evaluate Pro² on nine natural distribution shift datasets and find that it improves upon existing methods, particularly when the number of target samples is very small.},

In the reverse process, we enforce information sharing by parameterizing a shared backbone denoising network with additional modality-specific decoder heads. This structure can simultaneously learn to generate different types of multi-modal data with a multi-task loss, derived from a new multi-modal variational lower bound.

However, current dataset distillation techniques fall short, showing a notable performance gap compared to training on the original data. In this work, we are the first to argue that the use of only one synthetic subset for distillation may not yield optimal generalization performance. This is because the training dynamics of deep networks drastically changes during training. Therefore, multiple synthetic subsets are required to capture the dynamics of training in different stages. To address this issue, we propose Progressive Dataset Distillation ({PDD}). {PDD} synthesizes multiple small sets of synthetic images, each conditioned on the previous sets, and trains the model on the cumulative union of these subsets without requiring additional training time. Our extensive experiments show that {PDD} can effectively improve the performance of existing dataset distillation methods by up to 4.3\%. In addition, our method for the first time enables generating considerably larger synthetic datasets.},

  abstract = {A newly-arising uncertainty estimation method named Evidential Deep Learning ({EDL}), which can obtain reliable predictive uncertainty in a single forward pass, has garnered increasing interest. Guided by the subjective logic theory, {EDL} obtains Dirichlet concentration parameters from deep neural networks, thus constructing a Dirichlet probability density function ({PDF}) to model the distribution of class probabilities. Despite its great success, we argue that {EDL} keeps nonessential settings in both stages of model construction and optimization. In this work, our analysis indicates that (1) in the construction of the Dirichlet {PDF}, a commonly ignored parameter termed prior weight governs the balance between leveraging the proportion of evidence and its magnitude in deriving predictive scores, and (2) in model optimization, a variance-minimized regularization term adopted by traditional {EDL} encourages the Dirichlet {PDF} to approach a Dirac delta function, potentially exacerbating overconfidence. Therefore, we propose the {R-EDL} (Relaxed-{EDL}) method by relaxing these nonessential settings. Specifically, {R-EDL} treats the prior weight as an adjustable hyper-parameter instead of a fixed scalar, and directly optimizes the expectation of the Dirichlet {PDF} provided to deprecate the variance-minimized regularization term. Extensive experiments and {SOTA} performances demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

@inproceedings{chen2024seine,
  abstract = {Recently video generation has achieved substantial progress with realistic results. Nevertheless, existing {AI}-generated videos are usually very short clips (``shot-level'') depicting a single scene. To deliver a coherent long video (``story-level''), it is desirable to have creative transition and prediction effects across different clips. This paper presents a short-to-long video diffusion model, {SEINE}, that focuses on generative transition and prediction. The goal is to generate high-quality long videos with smooth and creative transitions between scenes and varying lengths of shot-level videos. Specifically, we propose a random-mask video diffusion model to automatically generate transitions based on textual descriptions. By providing the images of different scenes as inputs, combined with text-based control, our model generates transition videos that ensure coherence and visual quality. Furthermore, the model can be readily extended to various tasks such as image-to-video animation and autoregressive video prediction. To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of this new generative task, we propose three assessing criteria for smooth and creative transition: temporal consistency, semantic similarity, and video-text semantic alignment. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach over existing methods for generative transition and prediction, enabling the creation of story-level long videos.},

However, they often face computational challenges and can falter in generalization, especially in capturing temporal abstractions for long-horizon tasks. To overcome this, we introduce the Hierarchical Diffuser, a simple, fast, yet surprisingly effective planning method combining the advantages of hierarchical and diffusion-based planning. Our model adopts a ``jumpy'' planning strategy at the higher level, which allows it to have a larger receptive field but at a lower computational cost -- a crucial factor for diffusion-based planning methods, as we have empirically verified. Additionally, the jumpy sub-goals guide our low-level planner, facilitating a fine-tuning stage and further improving our approach's effectiveness. We conducted empirical evaluations on standard offline reinforcement learning benchmarks, demonstrating our method's superior performance and efficiency in terms of training and planning speed compared to the non-hierarchical Diffuser as well as other hierarchical planning methods. Moreover, we explore our model's generalization capability, particularly on how our method improves generalization capabilities on compositional out-of-distribution tasks.},

Recently, {CLIP} has emerged as an effective approach that employs vision-language contrastive pretraining to learn joint image and text representations and exhibits remarkable performance in zero-shot learning and text-guided natural image generation. Despite the huge practical success of {CLIP}, its theoretical understanding remains elusive. In this paper, we formally study transferrable representation learning underlying {CLIP} and demonstrate how features from different modalities get aligned.

We show that the Lipschitz continuity of the decoder is the key to making it work, provide a proof that {PCA} is just a linear special case of it, and reveal that it has a similar {PCA}-like importance ordering effect when applied to nonlinear models. We demonstrate the intuition behind the regularization on some pedagogical toy problems, and its effectiveness on several benchmark problems, including {MNIST}, {CIFAR-10} and {CelebA}. Our method uses spectral normalization to ensure that the Lipschitz constant of the decoder remains bound, preventing trivial compression of latent dimensions by making sure each dimension still carries its informative value in reconstruction.},

@inproceedings{chen2024when,
  abstract = {Despite recent advancements in semantic segmentation, where and what pixels are hard to segment remains largely unexplored. Existing research only separates an image into easy and hard regions and empirically observes the latter are associated with object boundaries. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of hard pixel errors, categorizing them into three types: false responses, merging mistakes, and displacements. Our findings reveal a quantitative association between hard pixels and aliasing, which is distortion caused by the overlapping of frequency components in the Fourier domain during downsampling. To identify the frequencies responsible for aliasing, we propose using the equivalent sampling rate to calculate the Nyquist frequency, which marks the threshold for aliasing. Then, we introduce the aliasing score as a metric to quantify the extent of aliasing. While positively correlated with the proposed aliasing score, three types of hard pixels exhibit different patterns. Here, we propose two novel de-aliasing filter ({DAF}) and frequency mixing ({FreqMix}) modules to alleviate aliasing degradation by accurately removing or adjusting frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency. The {DAF} precisely removes the frequencies responsible for aliasing before downsampling, while the {FreqMix} dynamically selects high-frequency components within the encoder block. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic segmentation and low-light instance segmentation tasks.},

In contrast to {DMs}, our framework demonstrates the capability to generate realistic data points at an early stage of dynamics propagation. This early prediction sets the stage for efficient data generation by leveraging additional velocity information along the trajectory. On standard image generation benchmarks, our model yields favorable performance over baselines in the regime of small Number of Function Evaluations.

We construct a policy satisfying the $\epsilon$-{DP} constraint (called {DP}-{BAI}) by proposing the principle of maximum absolute determinants, and derive an upper bound on its error probability. Furthermore, we derive a minimax lower bound on the error probability, and demonstrate that the lower and the upper bounds decay exponentially in $T$, with exponents in the two bounds matching order-wise in (a) the sub-optimality gaps of the arms, (b) $\epsilon$, and (c) the dimension parameters.},

In this paper, we propose PolyGCL, a GCL pipeline that utilizes polynomial filters to achieve contrastive learning between low-pass and high-pass views. Specifically, PolyGCL utilizes polynomials with learnable filter functions to generate different spectral views and an objective that incorporates high-pass information through a linear combination.

  abstract = {The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) stands as a canonical NP-complete task. In particular, the scarcity of real-world SAT instances and their usefulness for tuning SAT solvers underscore the necessity for effective and efficient ways of hard instance generation, whereas existing methods either struggle to maintain plausible hardness or suffer from limited applicability. Different from the typical construction-based methods, this paper introduces an adaptive and efficient graph interpolation approach that in place modifies the raw structure of graph-represented SAT instance by replacing it with a counterpart from another instance. Specifically, it involves a two-stage matching and mixing pipeline. The matching aims to find a correspondence map of literal nodes from two instance graphs via learned features from a matching network; while the mixing stage involves iteratively exchanging clause pairs with the highest correspondence scores until a specified replacement ratio is achieved. We further show that under our matching-mixing framework, moderate randomness can avoid hardness degradation of instances by introducing Gumbel noise. Experimental results show the superiority of our method with both resemblance in structure and hardness, and general applicability.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) strengthen instruction-following capability through instruction-finetuning (IFT) on supervised instruction/response data. However, widely used IFT datasets (e.g., Alpaca's 52k data) surprisingly contain many low-quality instances with incorrect or irrelevant responses, which are misleading and detrimental to IFT. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective data selection strategy that automatically identifies and filters out low-quality data using a strong LLM (e.g., ChatGPT). To this end, we introduce AlpaGasus, which is finetuned on only 9k high-quality data filtered from the 52k Alpaca data. AlpaGasus significantly outperforms the original Alpaca as evaluated by GPT-4 on multiple test sets and the controlled human evaluation. Its 13B variant matches >90% performance of its teacher LLM (i.e., Text-Davinci-003 generating the 52k data) on test tasks. It also provides 5.7x faster training, reducing the training time for a 7B variant from 80 minutes (for Alpaca) to 14 minutes. Moreover, the experiments prove the efficacy of our method across diverse datasets, base models, and LLM filters. Overall, AlpaGasus demonstrates a novel data-centric IFT paradigm that can be generally applied to instruction-tuning data, leading to faster training and better instruction-following models.},

However, GFlowNets can only be used with a predefined scalar reward, which can be either computationally expensive or not directly accessible, in the case of multi-objective optimization (MOO) tasks for example. Moreover, to prioritize identifying high-reward candidates, the conventional practice is to raise the reward to a higher exponent, the optimal choice of which may vary across different environments. To address these issues, we propose Order-Preserving GFlowNets (OP-GFNs), which sample with probabilities in proportion to a learned reward function that is consistent with a provided (partial) order on the candidates, thus eliminating the need for an explicit formulation of the reward function.},

Within SYMBOL, we then develop three distinct strategies based on reinforcement learning, so as to meta-learn the SEG efficiently.

Recent studies have extended Deep Neural Networks ({DNN}s) to manifolds, and concomitantly, normalization techniques have also been adapted to several manifolds, referred to as Riemannian normalization. Nonetheless, most of the existing Riemannian normalization methods have been derived in an ad hoc manner and only apply to specific manifolds. This paper establishes a unified framework for Riemannian Batch Normalization ({RBN}) techniques on Lie groups. Our framework offers the theoretical guarantee of controlling both the Riemannian mean and variance. Empirically, we focus on Symmetric Positive Definite ({SPD}) manifolds, which possess three distinct types of Lie group structures. Using the deformation concept, we generalize the existing Lie groups on {SPD} manifolds into three families of parameterized Lie groups. Specific normalization layers induced by these Lie groups are then proposed for {SPD} neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through three sets of experiments: radar recognition, human action recognition, and electroencephalography ({EEG}) classification.},

We verify our principles with comprehensive experiments. More importantly, our strategy further sheds light on advancing current benchmarks for architecture design.

However, the usage of diffusion models to generate the high-quality object detection data remains an underexplored area, where not only image-level perceptual quality but also geometric conditions such as bounding boxes and camera views are essential. Previous studies have utilized either copy-paste synthesis or layout-to-image ({L2I}) generation with specifically designed modules to encode the semantic layouts. In this paper, we propose the GeoDiffusion, a simple framework that can flexibly translate various geometric conditions into text prompts and empower pre-trained text-to-image ({T2I}) diffusion models for high-quality detection data generation. Unlike previous {L2I} methods, our GeoDiffusion is able to encode not only the bounding boxes but also extra geometric conditions such as camera views in self-driving scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate GeoDiffusion outperforms previous {L2I} methods while maintaining 4× training time faster. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to adopt diffusion models for layout-to-image generation with geometric conditions and demonstrate that {L2I}-generated images can be beneficial for improving the performance of object detectors.},

This paper introduces {PIXART}-α, a Transformer-based {T2I} diffusion model whose image generation quality is competitive with state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Imagen, {SDXL}, and even Midjourney), reaching near-commercial application standards. Additionally, it supports high-resolution image synthesis up to 1024px resolution with low training cost. To achieve this goal, three core designs are proposed: (1) Training strategy decomposition: We devise three distinct training steps that separately optimize pixel dependency, text-image alignment, and image aesthetic quality; (2) Efficient {T2I} Transformer: We incorporate cross-attention modules into Diffusion Transformer ({DiT}) to inject text conditions and streamline the computation-intensive class-condition branch; (3) High-informative data: We emphasize the significance of concept density in text-image pairs and leverage a large Vision-Language model to auto-label dense pseudo-captions to assist text-image alignment learning. As a result, {PIXART}-α's training speed markedly surpasses existing large-scale {T2I} models, e.g., {PIXART}-α only takes 10.8\% of Stable Diffusion v1.5's training time (~675 vs. ~6,250 A100 {GPU} days), saving nearly \$300,000 (\$26,000 vs. \$320,000) and reducing 90\% {CO}2 emissions.},

  abstract = {Composed image retrieval aims to search for target images based on a reference image and a text query. Current methods focus on learning fine-grained relationships through positive and negative pairs during training, using a one-to-one distance paradigm. However, this approach doesn't align with the coarse-grained retrieval process where users gradually refine their search from coarse to fine-grained feedback, compromising the recall rate. This paper introduces a unified learning approach that simultaneously models coarse- and fine-grained retrieval by considering multi-grained uncertainty. The method contains two modules: uncertainty modeling that simulates multi-grained queries by introducing identically distributed fluctuations in the feature space, and uncertainty regularization that adapts the matching objective according to the fluctuation range.

  abstract = {Transformers for time series forecasting mainly model time series from limited or fixed scales, making it challenging to capture different characteristics spanning various scales. This paper proposes Pathformer, a multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways that addresses this limitation. The key innovations include multi-scale division that divides time series into different temporal resolutions using patches of various sizes, dual attention performed over these patches to capture global correlations and local details as temporal dependencies, and adaptive pathways that dynamically adjust the multi-scale modeling process based on varying temporal dynamics of the input. Pathformer integrates both temporal resolution and temporal distance for comprehensive multi-scale modeling, enabling it to adaptively select and aggregate scale-specific characteristics based on different temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on eleven real-world datasets demonstrate that Pathformer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance by surpassing all current models but also exhibits stronger generalization abilities under various transfer scenarios.},

  abstract = {Model ensemble adversarial attack has become a powerful method for generating transferable adversarial examples. Previous works simply average the outputs of different models, lacking an in-depth analysis on how and why model ensemble methods can strongly improve the transferability. This paper rethinks ensemble methods in adversarial attacks and defines the common weakness of model ensemble with two properties: the flatness of loss landscape and the closeness to the local optimum of each model. Empirical and theoretical analysis show that both properties are strongly correlated with the transferability. Based on these insights, the authors propose a Common Weakness Attack (CWA) to generate more transferable adversarial examples by promoting these two properties. Experimental results on both image classification and object detection tasks validate the effectiveness of their approach in improving adversarial transferability, especially when attacking adversarially trained models. The method is also successfully applied to attack a black-box large vision-language model, Google's Bard, demonstrating its practical effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has become a popular technique for solving machine learning (ML) problems when first-order (FO) information is difficult or impossible to obtain. However, the scalability of ZO optimization remains an open problem: Its use has primarily been limited to relatively small-scale ML problems, such as sample-wise adversarial attack generation. To our best knowledge, no prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of ZO optimization in training deep neural networks (DNNs) without a significant decrease in performance. To overcome this roadblock, we develop {DeepZero}, a principled and practical ZO deep learning (DL) framework that can scale ZO optimization to {DNN} training from scratch through three primary innovations. First, we demonstrate the advantages of coordinate-wise gradient estimation (CGE) over randomized vector-wise gradient estimation in training accuracy and computational efficiency. Second, we propose a sparsity-induced ZO training protocol that extends the model pruning methodology using only finite differences to explore and exploit the sparse {DL} prior in {CGE}. Third, we develop the methods of feature reuse and forward parallelization to advance the practical implementations of ZO training. Our extensive experiments show that {DeepZero} achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on {ResNet}-20 trained on {CIFAR}-10, approaching {FO} training performance for the first time. Furthermore, we show the practical utility of {DeepZero} in applications of certified adversarial defense and {DL}-based partial differential equation error correction, achieving 10--20\% improvement over {SOTA}.},

@inproceedings{2024disenbooth,
  abstract = {Subject-driven text-to-image generation aims to generate customized images of the given subject based on the text descriptions, which has drawn increasing attention. Existing methods mainly resort to finetuning a pretrained generative model, where the identity-relevant information (e.g., the boy) and the identity-irrelevant information (e.g., the background or the pose of the boy) are entangled in the latent embedding space. However, the highly entangled latent embedding may lead to failure in subject-driven text-to-image generation in two ways: (i) the identity-irrelevant information hidden in the entangled embedding may dominate the generation process, resulting in generated images heavily dependent on the irrelevant information while ignoring the given text descriptions; (ii) the identity-relevant information carried in the entangled embedding can not be appropriately preserved, resulting in identity change of the subject in the generated images. To tackle the problems, we propose {DisenBooth}, an identity-preserving disentangled tuning framework for subject-driven text-to-image generation. Different from previous works that utilize an entangled embedding to denoise each image, {DisenBooth} instead utilizes disentangled embeddings to respectively preserve the subject identity and capture the identity-irrelevant information. We further design novel weak denoising and contrastive embedding auxiliary tuning objectives to achieve the disentanglement. Extensive experiments show that our proposed {DisenBooth} framework outperforms baseline models for subject-driven text-to-image generation with the identity-preserved embedding. Additionally, by combining the identity-preserved embedding and identity-irrelevant embedding, {DisenBooth} demonstrates more generation flexibility and controllability.},

Existing methods primarily focus on local inconsistency mining ({LIM}), based on the intuition that establishing high similarities between abnormal nodes and their neighbors is difficult. However, the message passing employed by graph neural networks ({GNNs}) results in local anomaly signal loss, as {GNNs} tend to make connected nodes similar, which conflicts with the {LIM} intuition. This paper introduces {GADAM}, a novel framework that not only resolves the conflict between {LIM} and message passing but also leverages message passing to augment anomaly detection through a transformative approach to anomaly mining beyond {LIM}. {GADAM} includes an efficient {MLP}-based {LIM} approach to obtain local anomaly scores in a conflict-free way and a novel approach to capture anomaly signals from a global perspective. Moreover, we introduce a hybrid attention based adaptive message passing, enabling nodes to selectively absorb abnormal or normal signals from their surroundings. Extensive experiments conducted on nine benchmark datasets, including two large-scale {OGB} datasets, demonstrate that {GADAM} surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.},

Prior works either tackle the problem from the autoregressive generation perspective or model layout generation as a discrete diffusion process, both of which suffer from limited diversity and poor generation quality. In this work, we propose {LACE} ({LA}yout {C}onstraint diffusion mod{E}l), a unified model to handle a broad range of layout generation tasks, such as arranging elements with specified attributes and refining or completing a coarse layout design. Built upon a diffusion model, {LACE} formulates various controllable layout generation tasks as conditional generation processes in continuous space. Compared with existing methods that use discrete diffusion models, continuous state-space design can enable the incorporation of differentiable aesthetic constraint functions in training. Specifically, we propose two aesthetic constraint loss functions that promote global alignment and minimize overlap in the layout. These functions serve as constraints during both the training and post-processing phases. Our extensive experiments show that {LACE} produces high-quality layouts and outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines on public benchmarks.},

@inproceedings{cheng2024bridging,
  abstract = {Cognitive science studies have suggested that symbolic representation in the human brain does not appear out of nowhere; rather, there is a gradual transition from neural perception to preliminary symbols and eventually to symbolic languages over the course of human evolution. The transitional representation, preliminary symbols, is essential in connecting neural and symbolic representation. A transitional representation should be in between that (1) contains high-dimensional details of the input and (2) implies structural information about the semantics of the input. This work introduces a novel Transitional Dictionary Learning ({TDL}) framework that can implicitly learn symbolic knowledge, such as visual parts and relations, by reconstructing the input as a combination of parts with implicit relations. We use a game-theoretic diffusion model to decompose the input into visual parts using the dictionaries learned by the Expectation Maximization ({EM}) algorithm, implemented as the online prototype clustering, based on the decomposition results. We also propose two metrics, clustering information gain, and heuristic shape score to evaluate the model. Experiments are conducted on three abstract compositional visual object datasets, which require the model to utilize the compositionality of data instead of simply exploiting visual features. Our results show huge improvements compared to the state-of-the-art part segmentation baselines, which struggle to process abstract objects that lack distinct visual features. We also conduct human evaluations; the results demonstrate significantly improved interpretability of the proposed method and the proposed metrics are consistent with human assessments.},

Current state-of-the-art architectures rely on activation functions that are applied element-wise.

This study introduces {MONet}, a novel network using {Multilinear Operators} that relies solely on multilinear operators. The core layer of {MONet}, termed the {Mu-Layer}, captures multiplicative interactions of the elements of the input token. {MONet} captures high-degree interactions of the input elements, and the proposed model outperforms prior polynomial networks and performs on par with modern architectures. Furthermore, our empirical analysis demonstrates the theoretical underpinnings of our approach, validating the effectiveness of multilinear operators in deep learning. We evaluate {MONet} on a series of image recognition and scientific computing benchmarks, where it achieves competitive performance. The ability of {MONet} to remove nonlinear activation functions while maintaining competitive performance opens new research directions in neural network design.},

This paper explores the utilization of momentum to enhance the performance of {FedAvg} and {SCAFFOLD}. When all clients participate in the training process, we demonstrate that incorporating momentum allows {FedAvg} to converge without relying on the assumption of bounded data heterogeneity even using a constant local learning rate. This is novel and fairly surprising as existing analyses for {FedAvg} require bounded data heterogeneity even with diminishing local learning rates. In partial client participation, we show that momentum enables {SCAFFOLD} to converge provably faster without imposing any additional assumptions. Furthermore, we use momentum to develop new variance-reduced extensions of {FedAvg} and {SCAFFOLD}, which exhibit state-of-the-art convergence rates. To ensure simplicity and practicality in implementations, we only introduce momentum to the local {SGD} steps, avoiding any inclusion of impractical elements, such as gradient computation of multiple minibatches or solving local problems to high precision. Remarkably, this straightforward approach effectively alleviates the necessity for stringent assumptions regarding bounded data heterogeneity, leading to noteworthy improvements in convergence rates.},

This is primarily due to inherent under-calibration issues in multi-camera setups, including inconsistent imaging effects from separately calibrated image signal processing units in diverse cameras, and system errors from mechanical vibrations during driving that affect relative camera poses. To address these challenges, we present {UC-NeRF}, a novel method tailored for novel view synthesis in under-calibrated multi-view camera systems of autonomous driving. {UC-NeRF} incorporates a layer-based color correction to rectify color inconsistency in different image regions and a virtual warping to generate more viewpoint-diverse but color-consistent virtual views for color correction and {3D} recovery. The virtual warping strategy generates viewpoint-diverse yet color-consistent observations for each camera at each moment, offering stronger constraints on the latent codes for color correction. Additionally, we design spatiotemporally constrained pose refinement for more robust and accurate pose calibration in multi-camera systems. In under-calibrated multi-camera systems, standard {NeRF} quality significantly degrades with color discrepancies, object ghosts, and wrong geometry, while {UC-NeRF} achieves high-quality rendering and accurate geometry in these challenging cases.},

However, while high-fidelity geometry generation has made significant progress recently, texture generation has received relatively less attention. In this work, we present {TUVF} ({Texture} {UV} {Radiance} {Fields}), a method that can generate textures in a learnable {UV} sphere space rather than directly on the {3D} shape. This allows the texture to be disentangled from the underlying shape and transferable to other shapes that share the same {UV} space, i.e., from the same category. Given a {3D} shape, {TUVF} synthesizes realistic, high-fidelity, diverse, and {3D} consistent textures. Our goal is to facilitate a controllable texture generation process, such that one texture code can correspond to a particular appearance style independent of any input shapes from a category. The method integrates the {UV} sphere space with the radiance field, which provides a more efficient and accurate representation of textures than traditional texture maps. Instead of learning from reconstruction with multi-view datasets, our method leverages {GANs} for learning from {2D} single-view image collections.

  abstract = {Time series forecasting is an important task whose techniques have been applied to electricity forecasting, trajectory prediction, labor planning, etc. However, most time series forecasting techniques assume clean training data without anomalies, which is unrealistic since the collected time series data can be contaminated in practice. The forecasting model will be inferior if it is directly trained by time series with anomalies. Thus it is essential to develop methods to automatically learn a robust forecasting model from the contaminated data. In this paper, we first statistically define three types of anomalies, then theoretically and experimentally analyze the loss robustness and sample robustness when these anomalies exist. Based on our analyses, we propose {RobustTSF}, a simple and efficient algorithm to learn a robust forecasting model. In contrast to the detection-imputation-retraining pipeline, {RobustTSF} identifies informative samples by assessing the variance between the original input time series and its trend. Subsequently, it employs a robust loss function to improve the forecasting process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to extend the theory of learning with noisy labels ({LNL}) to time series forecasting, which builds a bridge between {LNL} and time series forecasting with anomalies ({TSFA}) tasks.

The {CausalTime} pipeline begins from real observations in a specific scenario and produces a matching benchmark dataset through a four-step process. We harness deep neural networks along with normalizing flow to accurately capture realistic dynamics, then extract hypothesized causal graphs by performing importance analysis on the neural network or leveraging prior knowledge. We derive the ground truth causal graphs by splitting the causal model into causal term, residual term, and noise term. Using the fitted network and the derived causal graph, we generate corresponding versatile time-series proper for algorithm assessment. In our experiments, we validate the fidelity of the generated data through qualitative and quantitative experiments, followed by a benchmarking of existing {TSCD} algorithms using these generated datasets. {CausalTime} offers a feasible solution to evaluating {TSCD} algorithms in real applications and can be generalized to a wide range of fields.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the challenging problem of estimating causal effects from observational data, in the presence of unobserved confounders. The two-stage least square ({TSLS}) method and its variants with a standard instrumental variable ({IV}) are commonly used to eliminate confounding bias, including the bias caused by unobserved confounders, but they rely on the linearity assumption. Besides, the strict condition of unconfounded instruments posed on a standard {IV} is too strong to be practical. We propose a novel confounding balance representation learning method for non-linear conditional {IV} ({CIV}) regression in average causal effect estimation from observational data with latent confounders. Specifically, we use a conditional {IV} ({CIV}) to relax the unconfounded instrument condition of standard {IV} and propose a non-linear {CIV} regression with {Confounding} {Balancing} {Representation} {Learning}, {CBRL}.{CIV}, for jointly eliminating the confounding bias from unobserved confounders and balancing the observed confounders, without the linearity assumption. The {CBRL}.{CIV} method addresses the imbalance problems of observed confounders and the confounding bias of unobserved confounders by using a balancing representation learning network to obtain a balancing representation of the observed confounders and removing the confounding bias caused by unobserved confounders simultaneously in a non-linear system. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract = {Recent text-to-{3D} generation methods achieve impressive {3D} content creation capacity thanks to the advances in image diffusion models and optimizing strategies. However, current methods struggle to generate correct {3D} content for a complex prompt in semantics, i.e., a prompt describing multiple interacted objects binding with different attributes. In this work, we propose a general framework named {Progressive3D}, which decomposes the entire generation into a series of locally progressive editing steps to create precise {3D} content for complex prompts, and constrains the content change to only occur in regions determined by user-defined region prompts in each editing step. Furthermore, we propose an overlapped semantic component suppression ({OSCS}) technique to encourage the optimization process to focus more on the semantic differences between prompts. For a specific editing step, the framework edits the pre-trained source representation in the {3D} space determined by the user-defined region prompt according to the semantic difference between the source prompt and the target prompt. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed {Progressive3D} framework generates precise {3D} content for prompts with complex semantics and is general for various text-to-{3D} methods driven by different {3D} representations, including {NeRF}-based, {SDF}-based, and {DMTet}-based methods.},

Current research efforts mainly focus on improving model architectures and learning algorithms on fixed datasets to achieve this goal. In contrast, in this paper, we address an orthogonal yet crucial problem: given a fixed convex learning model (or a convex surrogate for a non-convex model) and a function of interest, we assess what data benefits the model by interpreting the feature space, and then aim to improve performance as measured by this function. To this end, we propose the use of influence estimation models for interpreting the classifier's performance from the perspective of the data feature space. Additionally, we propose data selection approaches based on influence that enhance model utility, fairness, and robustness. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we validate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches not only for conventional classification scenarios, but also under more challenging scenarios such as distribution shifts, fairness poisoning attacks, utility evasion attacks, online learning, and active learning.},

Fixing this issue is known as model calibration, and has consequently received much attention in the form of modified training schemes and post-training calibration procedures such as temperature scaling. While temperature scaling is frequently used because of its simplicity, it is often outperformed by modified training schemes. In this work, we identify a specific bottleneck for the performance of temperature scaling. We show that for empirical risk minimizers for a general set of distributions in which the supports of classes have overlaps, the performance of temperature scaling degrades with the amount of overlap between classes, and asymptotically becomes no better than random when there are a large number of classes. On the other hand, we prove that optimizing a modified form of the empirical risk induced by the Mixup data augmentation technique can in fact lead to reasonably good calibration performance, showing that training-time calibration may be necessary in some situations. We also verify that our theoretical results reflect practice by showing that Mixup significantly outperforms empirical risk minimization (with respect to multiple calibration metrics) on image classification benchmarks with class overlaps introduced in the form of label noise.},

Once we have trained one DNN on some dataset, we have its learning trajectory (i.e., a sequence of intermediate parameters during training) which may potentially contain useful information for learning the dataset. However, there has been no attempt to utilize such information of a given learning trajectory for another training. In this paper, we formulate the problem of "transferring" a given learning trajectory from one initial parameter to another one (named *learning transfer problem*) and derive the first algorithm to approximately solve it by matching gradients successively along the trajectory via permutation symmetry. We empirically show that the transferred parameters achieve non-trivial accuracy before any direct training, and can be trained significantly faster than training from scratch.},

To sidestep the difficulty of contact modeling in conventional modeling-based approaches, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising alternative. However, previous RL approaches either lack the ability to generalize over diverse object shapes, or use simple action primitives that limit the diversity of robot motions. Furthermore, using RL over diverse object geometry is challenging due to the high cost of training a policy that takes in high-dimensional sensory inputs. We propose a novel contact-based object representation and pretraining pipeline to tackle this. To enable massively parallel training, we leverage a lightweight patch-based transformer architecture for our encoder that processes point clouds, thus scaling our training across thousands of environments. Compared to learning from scratch, or other shape representation baselines, our representation facilitates both time- and data-efficient learning. We validate the efficacy of our overall system by zero-shot transferring the trained policy to novel real-world objects.},

While cognitive science emphasizes the significance of spatial context in the formation and retrieval of episodic memory, the current primary approach to implementing episodic memory in AI systems is through transformers that store temporally ordered experiences, which overlooks the spatial dimension. As a result, it is unclear how the underlying structure could be extended to incorporate the spatial axis beyond temporal order alone and thereby what benefits can be obtained. To address this, this paper explores the use of Spatially-Aware Transformer models that incorporate spatial information. These models enable the creation of place-centric episodic memory that considers both temporal and spatial dimensions. Adopting this approach, we demonstrate that memory utilization efficiency can be improved, leading to enhanced accuracy in various place-centric downstream tasks. Additionally, we propose the Adaptive Memory Allocator, a memory management method based on reinforcement learning that aims to optimize efficiency of memory utilization. Our experiments demonstrate the advantages of our proposed model in various environments and across multiple downstream tasks, including prediction, generation, reasoning, and reinforcement learning.},

LL employs module-wise BP to achieve competitive results yet relies on module-wise auxiliary networks, which increase memory and parameter demands. Conversely, FL updates layer weights without BP and auxiliary networks but falls short of BP's performance.

Among the recent successes of imputation methods based on generative models, the information bottleneck (IB) framework offers a well-suited theoretical foundation for multiple imputations, allowing us to account for the uncertainty associated with the imputed values. However, directly applying the IB framework to time series data without considering their temporal context can lead to a substantial loss of temporal dependencies, which, in turn, can degrade the overall imputation performance. To address such a challenge, we propose a novel conditional information bottleneck (CIB) approach for time series imputation, which aims to mitigate the potentially negative consequences of the regularization constraint by focusing on reducing the redundant information conditioned on the temporal context. We provide a theoretical analysis of its effect by adapting variational decomposition. We use the resulting insight and propose a novel deep learning method that can approximately achieve the proposed CIB objective for time series imputation as a combination of evidence lower bound and novel temporal kernel-enhanced contrastive optimization. Our experiments, conducted on multiple real-world datasets, consistently demonstrate that our method significantly improves imputation performance (including both interpolation and extrapolation), and also enhances classification performance based on the imputed values.},

We characterize the asymptotic learning utility for any choice of the correlation function, giving precise analytical bounds for linear regression and as the solution to a convex program for general convex functions. Using these bounds, we show how correlated noise provably improves upon vanilla DP-SGD as a function of problem parameters such as the effective dimension and condition number. We also derive an analytical expression for the near-optimal correlation function that circumvents the cubic complexity of the semi-definite program used to optimize the noise correlation matrix in previous work.

This analysis is key to DP-SGD's success in machine learning, but, is not readily applicable to the newer state-of-the-art algorithms. This is because these algorithms, known as DP-FTRL, use the matrix mechanism to add correlated noise instead of independent noise as in DP-SGD. In this paper, we propose MMCC, the first algorithm to analyze privacy amplification via sampling for any generic matrix mechanism. MMCC is nearly tight in that it approaches a lower bound as epsilon approaches zero. To analyze correlated outputs in MMCC, we prove that they can be analyzed as if they were independent, by conditioning them on prior outputs. Our conditional composition theorem has broad utility: we use it to show that the noise added to binary-tree-DP-FTRL can asymptotically match the noise added to DP-SGD with amplification.},

To enable this, we extend the Transformer architecture in multiple ways: (1) a code-invariant initial embedding, which is also position- and length-invariant, (2) a learned modulation of the attention maps that is conditioned on the Tanner graph, and (3) a length-invariant code-aware noise prediction module that is based on the parity-check matrix. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed foundation model achieves competitive performance on multiple codes, including unseen codes, and can serve as a universal decoder for error correction across different code families.},

  abstract = {Logic synthesis, a pivotal stage in chip design, entails optimizing chip specifications encoded in hardware description languages like Verilog into highly efficient implementations using Boolean logic gates. The process involves a sequential application of logic minimization heuristics (synthesis recipe), with their arrangement significantly impacting crucial metrics such as area and delay. Addressing the challenge posed by the broad spectrum of hardware design complexities -- from variations of past designs (e.g., adders and multipliers) to entirely novel configurations (e.g., innovative processor instructions) -- requires a nuanced synthesis recipe guided by human expertise and intuition. This study conducts a thorough examination of learning and search techniques for logic synthesis, unearthing a surprising revelation: pre-trained agents, when confronted with entirely novel designs, may veer off course, detrimentally affecting the search trajectory. We propose a retrieval-guided reinforcement learning approach for logic synthesis that adjusts agent recommendations using nearest neighbor similarity scores for improved synthesis recipe optimization.},

@inproceedings{chowdhury2024enhancing,
  abstract = {Fairness, especially group fairness, is an important consideration in the context of machine learning systems. The most commonly adopted group fairness-enhancing techniques are in-processing methods that rely on a mixture of a fairness objective (e.g., demographic parity) and a task-specific objective (e.g., cross-entropy) during the training process. However, when data arrives in an online fashion -- one instance at a time -- optimizing such fairness objectives poses several challenges. In particular, group fairness objectives are defined using expectations of predictions across different demographic groups. In the online setting, where the algorithm has access to a single instance at a time, estimating the group fairness objective requires additional storage and significantly more computation (e.g., forward/backward passes) than the task-specific objective at every time step. In this paper, we propose Aranyani, an ensemble of oblique decision trees, to make fair decisions in online settings. The hierarchical tree structure of Aranyani enables parameter isolation and allows us to efficiently compute the fairness gradients using aggregate statistics of previous decisions, eliminating the need for additional storage and forward/backward passes.},

The fundamental objective of this field is to faithfully recreate the head avatar and precisely control expressions and postures. Existing methods, categorized into 2D-based warping, mesh-based, and neural rendering approaches, present challenges in maintaining multi-view consistency, incorporating non-facial information, and generalizing to new identities. In this paper, we propose GPAvatar, a framework that reconstructs 3D head avatars from one or several images in a single forward pass. The key idea of this work is to introduce a dynamic point-based expression field driven by a point cloud to precisely and effectively capture expressions. Furthermore, we use a Multi Tri-planes Attention (MTA) fusion module in the tri-planes canonical field to leverage information from multiple input images. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that GPAvatar achieves faithful identity reconstruction, precise expression control, and multi-view consistency, showing promising results for free-viewpoint rendering and novel view synthesis.},

However, clustering unlabeled images, as a fundamental and classic machine learning problem, still lacks an effective solution, particularly for large-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel image clustering pipeline that leverages the powerful feature representation of large pre-trained models such as {CLIP} and cluster images effectively and efficiently at scale. We first developed a novel algorithm to estimate the number of clusters in a given dataset. We then show that the pre-trained features are significantly more structured by further optimizing the rate reduction objective. The resulting features may significantly improve the clustering accuracy, e.g., from 57\% to 66\% on {ImageNet}-1k. Furthermore, by leveraging {CLIP}'s multimodality bridge between image and text, we develop a simple yet effective self-labeling algorithm that produces meaningful text labels for the clusters. Through extensive experiments, we show that our pipeline works well on standard datasets such as {CIFAR}-10, {CIFAR}-100, and {ImageNet}-1k. It also extends to datasets without predefined labels, such as {LAION}-Aesthetics and {WikiArts}.},

We propose a simple decoding strategy for reducing hallucinations with pretrained {LLMs} that does not require conditioning on retrieved external knowledge nor additional fine-tuning. Our approach obtains the next-token distribution by contrasting the differences in logits obtained from projecting the later layers versus earlier layers to the vocabulary space, exploiting the fact that factual knowledge in an {LLMs} has generally been shown to be localized to particular transformer layers. We find that this Decoding by Contrasting Layers ({DoLa}) approach is able to better surface factual knowledge and reduce the generation of incorrect facts. {DoLa} consistently improves the truthfulness across multiple choices tasks and open-ended generation tasks, for example improving the performance of {LLaMA} family models on {TruthfulQA} by 12--17\% absolute points, demonstrating its potential in making {LLMs} reliably generate truthful facts.},

  abstract = {Image-Text Matching ({ITM}) task, a fundamental vision-language ({VL}) task, suffers from the inherent ambiguity arising from multiplicity and imperfect annotations. Deterministic functions are not sufficiently powerful to capture ambiguity, prompting the exploration of probabilistic embeddings to tackle the challenge. However, the existing probabilistic {ITM} approach encounters two key shortcomings; the burden of heavy computations due to the Monte Carlo approximation, and the loss saturation issue in the face of abundant false negatives. To overcome the issues, this paper presents an improved Probabilistic Cross-Modal Embeddings (named {PCME}++) by introducing a new probabilistic distance with a closed-form solution. In addition, two optimization techniques are proposed to enhance {PCME}++ further: first, the incorporation of pseudo-positives to prevent the negative effect under massive false negatives; second, mixed sample data augmentation for probabilistic matching. Experimental results on {MS-COCO} Caption and two extended benchmarks, {CxC} and {ECCV} Caption, demonstrate the effectiveness of {PCME}++ compared to state-of-the-art {ITM} methods. The robustness of {PCME}++ is also evaluated under noisy image-text correspondences. In addition, the potential applicability of {PCME}++ in automatic prompt-filtering for zero-shot classification is shown.},

For example, the conjugate gradient method ({CG}), one of the most popular Krylov subspace methods, is based on the idea of minimizing the residual error in the Krylov subspace. However, with the recent advancement of high-performance diffusion solvers for inverse problems, it is not clear how classical wisdom can be synergistically combined with modern diffusion models. In this study, we propose a novel and efficient diffusion sampling strategy that synergistically combines the diffusion sampling and Krylov subspace methods. Specifically, we prove that if the tangent space at a denoised sample by Tweedie's formula forms a Krylov subspace, then the {CG} initialized with the denoised data ensures the data consistency while enabling faster convergence for large-scale inverse problems.},

Controlling for such nuisance variables is common within standard statistical analysis, but the ideas do not directly apply to overparameterized models. Consequently, recent work has shown how strategies from invariant representation learning provides a meaningful starting point, but the current repertoire of methods is limited to accounting for shifts/imbalances in just a couple of covariates at a time.

@inproceedings{cohen2024posterior,
  abstract = {Image restoration problems are typically ill-posed in the sense that each degraded image can be restored in infinitely many valid ways. To accommodate this, many works generate a diverse set of outputs by attempting to randomly sample from the posterior distribution of natural images given the degraded input. Here we argue that this strategy is commonly of limited practical value because of the heavy tail of the posterior distribution. Consider for example inpainting a missing region of the sky in an image. Since there is a high probability that the missing region contains no object but clouds, any set of samples from the posterior would be entirely dominated by (practically identical) completions of sky. However, arguably, presenting users with only one clear sky completion, along with several alternative solutions such as airships, birds, and balloons, would better outline the set of possibilities. In this paper, we initiate the study of meaningfully diverse image restoration. We explore several post-processing approaches that can be combined with any diverse image restoration method to yield semantically meaningful diversity. Moreover, we propose a practical approach for allowing diffusion based image restoration methods to generate meaningfully diverse outputs, while incurring only negligible computational overhead. We conduct extensive user studies to analyze the proposed techniques, and find the strategy of reducing similarity between outputs to be significantly favorable over posterior sampling.},

We illustrate our theory through examples, which include certain mixtures of Gaussians.

While prior work has demonstrated the utility of incorporating augmented data directly into model-free RL updates, it is not well-understood when a particular DA strategy will improve data efficiency. In this paper, we seek to identify general aspects of DA responsible for observed learning improvements. Our study focuses on sparse-reward tasks with dynamics-invariant data augmentation functions, serving as an initial step towards a more general understanding of DA and its integration into RL training. Experimentally, we isolate three relevant aspects of DA: state-action coverage, reward density, and the number of augmented transitions generated per update (the augmented replay ratio). From our experiments, we draw two conclusions: (1) increasing state-action coverage often has a much greater impact on data efficiency than increasing reward density, and (2) decreasing the augmented replay ratio substantially improves data efficiency. In fact, certain tasks in our empirical study are solvable only when the replay ratio is sufficiently low.},

We analyze theoretically the joint distribution that particle guidance generates, how to learn a potential that achieves optimal diversity, and the connections with methods in other disciplines.

We propose a novel method that combines the learning stage with knowledge of the downstream optimization task. The method prescribes decisions which aim to maximize the likelihood that the cost is below a (user-controlled) threshold. The key idea is to discretize the feasible region into subsets so that the uncertain objective function can be well approximated deterministically within each subset, and devise a secondary optimization problem to prescribe decisions by integrating the information from the individual approximations. We provide theoretical guarantees bounding the underlying regret of decisions proposed by our method.},

@inproceedings{andre2024unprocessing,
  abstract = {Seven years ago, researchers proposed a postprocessing method to equalize the error rates of a model across different demographic groups. The work launched hundreds of papers purporting to improve over the postprocessing baseline. We empirically evaluate these claims through thousands of model evaluations on several tabular datasets. We find that the fairness-accuracy Pareto frontier achieved by postprocessing contains all other methods we were feasibly able to evaluate. At the heart of our study is a simple idea we call unprocessing that roughly corresponds to the inverse of postprocessing. Unprocessing allows for a direct comparison of methods using different underlying models and levels of relaxation. Our findings cast doubt on the narrative of progress in algorithmic fairness and raise questions about the complexity of proposed methods.},

First, we provide a tight closed-form characterization of the learnt velocity field, when parametrized by a shallow denoising auto-encoder trained on a finite number n of samples from the target distribution. Building on this analysis, we provide a sharp description of the corresponding generative flow, which pushes the base Gaussian density forward to an approximation of the target density. In particular, we provide closed-form formulae for the distance between the mean of the generated mixture and the mean of the target mixture, which we show decays as $\Theta_n(1/n)$.

  abstract = {We investigate a new practical learning scenario where data distributed across different sources/clients are typically generated with various modalities. Existing research on learning from multi-source data mostly assumes that each client owns data of all modalities, which may largely limit its practicability. In light of the expensiveness and sparsity of multimodal data, we propose patchwork learning to jointly learn from fragmented multimodal data in distributed clients. Considering the concerns about data privacy, patchwork learning aims to impute incomplete multimodal data for diverse downstream tasks without accessing the raw data directly. Local clients could miss different modality combinations. Due to the statistical heterogeneity induced by non-i.i.d. data, the imputation is more challenging since the learned dependencies fail to adapt to the imputation of other clients. To address these challenges, we propose CLAP (Collaborative Adaptation for Patchwork Learning), a method that enables effective collaboration among clients with different missing modality patterns while preserving data privacy.},

The MLE objective weights sequences proportionally to their frequency under the data distribution, with no guidance for the model's behaviour out of distribution (OOD): this leads to compounding error during autoregressive generation. We formulate sequence generation as an imitation learning (IL) problem, which allows us to minimize a variety of divergences between the distribution of sequences generated by an autoregressive model and sequences from a dataset, including divergences with weight on OOD generated sequences. The IL framework allows us to incorporate backtracking by introducing a backspace action into the generation process, which further mitigates the compounding error problem by allowing the model to revert a sampled token if it takes the sequence OOD. The resulting method, SequenceMatch, can be implemented without adversarial training or major architectural changes. Empirically, SequenceMatch training leads to improvements over MLE on text generation with language models and arithmetic.},

Existing approaches typically handle dropout error via imputation, which may introduce spurious relations as the true joint distribution is generally unidentifiable. To tackle this issue, we introduce a causal graphical model to characterize the dropout mechanism, namely, {C}ausal {D}ropout {M}odel.

  abstract = {Scaling Transformers to longer sequence lengths has been a major problem in the last several years, promising to improve performance in language modeling and high-resolution image understanding, as well as to unlock new applications in code, audio, and video generation. The attention layer is the main bottleneck in scaling to longer sequences, as its runtime and memory increase quadratically in the sequence length. FlashAttention exploits the asymmetric GPU memory hierarchy to bring significant memory saving (linear instead of quadratic) and runtime speedup (2-4× compared to optimized baselines), with no approximation. However, FlashAttention is still not nearly as fast as optimized matrix-multiply (GEMM) operations, reaching only 25-40% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s. We observe that the inefficiency is due to suboptimal work partitioning between different thread blocks and warps on the GPU, causing either low-occupancy or unnecessary shared memory reads/writes. We propose FlashAttention-2, with better work partitioning to address these issues. In particular, we (1) tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of non-matmul FLOPs (2) parallelize the attention computation, even for a single head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and (3) within each thread block, distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through shared memory. These yield around 2× speedup compared to FlashAttention, reaching 50-73% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s on A100 and getting close to the efficiency of GEMM operations. We empirically validate that when used end-to-end to train GPT-style models, FlashAttention-2 reaches training speed of up to 225 TFLOPs/s per A100 GPU (72% model FLOPs utilization).},

  abstract = {Binary neural networks (BNN) have emerged as an attractive computing paradigm for a wide range of low-power vision tasks. However, state-of-the-art BNNs do not yield any sparsity, and induce a significant number of non-binary operations. On the other hand, activation sparsity can be provided by spiking neural networks (SNN), that too have gained significant traction in recent times. Thanks to this sparsity, SNNs when implemented on neuromorphic hardware, have the potential to be significantly more power-efficient compared to traditional artificial neural networks. In this paper, we present a novel training framework for sparse binary activation neural networks (BANN) that achieves state-of-the-art in the trade-off between performance and compute efficiency. Our approach uses a novel variant of the Hoyer regularizer to train sparse binary activation neural networks. We estimate the threshold of each BANN layer as the Hoyer extremum of a clipped version of its activation map, where the clipping value is trained using gradient descent with our Hoyer regularizer. This approach shifts the activation values away from the threshold, thereby mitigating the effect of noise that can otherwise degrade the BANN accuracy. Our BANN outperforms existing BNNs, SNNs, and adder neural networks that also avoid energy-expensive multiplication operations.},

  abstract = {We investigate Neural Contextual Bandits (NeuCBs) and show neural bandit algorithms with provable regret guarantees and significantly better empirical performance. Building on recent works that showed a reduction from contextual bandits to online regression under a realizability assumption, we show an O(log T) regret for online regression with almost convex losses that satisfy the QG (Quadratic Growth) condition, a generalization of the PL (Polyak-Łojasiewicz) condition, and that have a unique minima. Using existing results for wide networks, we show that one can readily achieve an O(√T) regret for online regression with square loss, which implies an O(√K T^{3/4}) regret for Neural Contextual Bandits. Although not directly applicable to wide networks since they do not have unique minima, we show that adding a suitable small random perturbation to the network predictions surprisingly makes the loss satisfy QG with unique minima. Based on perturbed prediction, we show an O(log T) regret for online regression with both squared loss and KL loss, and subsequently convert these respectively to Õ(√KT) and Õ(√KL* + K) regret for NeuCB, where L* is the loss of the best policy.},

  abstract = {Large pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP provide compact and general-purpose representations of text and images that are demonstrably effective across multiple downstream zero-shot prediction tasks. However, owing to the nature of their training process, these models have the potential to 1) propagate or amplify societal biases in the training data and 2) learn to rely on spurious features. This paper proposes FairerCLIP, a general approach for making zero-shot predictions of CLIP more fair and robust to spurious correlations. We formulate the problem of jointly debiasing CLIP's image and text representations in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), which affords multiple benefits: 1) Flexibility: Unlike existing approaches, which are specialized to either learn with or without ground-truth labels, FairerCLIP is adaptable to learning in both scenarios. 2) Speed: FairerCLIP lends itself to an iterative optimization involving closed-form solvers, which leads to 4×-10× faster training than the existing methods. 3) Performance: Empirically, FairerCLIP achieves appreciable accuracy gains on benchmark fairness and spurious correlation datasets over their respective baselines.},

In this work we introduce model arithmetic, a novel inference framework for composing and biasing LLMs without the need for model (re)training or highly specific datasets. In addition to avoiding these costs, model arithmetic allows for more precise control of generated text than direct prompting and prior controlled text generation (CTG) techniques. Using model arithmetic, we can express prior CTG techniques as simple formulas and naturally extend them to new and more effective formulations. We also show that speculative sampling, a technique for efficient LLM sampling, extends to our setting, enabling highly efficient text generation with multiple composed models with only marginal overhead over a single model. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that model arithmetic allows fine-grained control of generated text while outperforming state-of-the-art on the task of toxicity reduction.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks are hindered by unsteady predictions when faced with noisy inputs and adversarial attacks, where the certified radius is a crucial indicator of model robustness. Randomized smoothing provides a promising framework by relying on noise injection into inputs to obtain a smoothed and robust classifier. In this work, we show that the variance introduced by the Monte-Carlo sampling in the randomized smoothing procedure estimate closely interacts with two other important properties of the classifier: its Lipschitz constant and margin. We emphasize the dual impact of the Lipschitz constant of the base classifier on both the smoothed classifier and the empirical variance. To increase the certified robust radius, we introduce a different way to convert logits to probability vectors for the base classifier to leverage the variance-margin trade-off. We leverage the use of Bernstein's concentration inequality along with enhanced Lipschitz bounds for randomized smoothing. Experimental results show a significant improvement in certified accuracy compared to current state-of-the-art methods. Our novel certification procedure allows us to use pre-trained models with randomized smoothing, effectively improving the current certification radius in a zero-shot manner.},

Recent machine learning has focused on training increasingly large self-supervised language models with impressive predictive capabilities, making them well-positioned to be strong compressors. In this work, we advocate for viewing the prediction problem through the lens of compression and evaluate the compression capabilities of large (foundation) models. We show that large language models are powerful general-purpose predictors and that the compression viewpoint provides novel insights into scaling laws, tokenization, and in-context learning. We compare arithmetic coding-based language model compressors to competitive general-purpose lossless compressors like gzip and LZMA2, as well as specialized lossless compressors for image and audio data. Chinchilla 70B, while trained primarily on text, compresses ImageNet patches to 43.4% and LibriSpeech samples to 16.4% of their raw size, beating domain-specific compressors like PNG (58.5%) or FLAC (30.3%), respectively.

However, typical {GT} models have at least quadratic complexity and thus cannot scale to large graphs. While there are several linear {GT}s recently proposed, they still lag behind {GNN} counterparts on several popular graph datasets, which poses a critical concern on their practical expressivity. To balance the trade-off between expressivity and scalability of {GT}s, we propose Polynormer, a polynomial-expressive {GT} model with linear complexity. Polynormer is built upon a novel base model that learns a high-degree polynomial on input features. To enable the base model permutation equivariant, we integrate it with graph topology and node features separately, resulting in local and global equivariant attention models. Consequently, Polynormer adopts a linear local-to-global attention scheme to learn high-degree equivariant polynomials whose coefficients are controlled by attention scores.},

However, quantization down to 3-4 bits per parameter usually leads to moderate-to-high accuracy losses, especially for smaller models in the 1-10B parameter range, which are well-suited for edge deployments. To address this accuracy issue, we introduce the Sparse-Quantized Representation ({SpQR}), a new compressed format and quantization technique which enables for the first time near-lossless compression of {LLM}s across model scales, while reaching similar compression levels to previous methods. {SpQR} works by identifying and isolating outlier weights, which cause particularly-large quantization errors, and storing them in higher precision, while compressing all other weights to 3-4 bits, and achieves relative accuracy losses of less than 1\% in perplexity for highly-accurate {LLaMA} and Falcon {LLM}s.},

Recent research has illuminated a key factor contributing to its practical efficacy: the implicit regularization it instigates. Several studies have investigated the linear stability property of {SGD} in the vicinity of a stationary point as a predictive proxy for sharpness and generalization error in overparameterized neural networks. In this paper, we delve deeper into the relationship between linear stability and sharpness. More specifically, we meticulously delineate the necessary and sufficient conditions for linear stability, contingent on hyperparameters of {SGD} and the geometry of the loss function. Towards this end, we introduce a novel coherence measure of the loss Hessian that encapsulates pertinent geometric properties of the loss function that are relevant to the linear stability of {SGD}. Notably, compared to previous works, our analysis relies on significantly milder assumptions and is applicable for a broader class of loss functions than known before, encompassing not only mean-squared error but also cross-entropy loss.},

While substantial efforts have been made to minimize the cumulative regret in dueling bandits, a notable gap in the current research is the absence of regret bounds that account for the inherent uncertainty in pairwise comparisons between the dueling arms. Intuitively, greater uncertainty suggests a higher level of difficulty in the problem. To bridge this gap, this paper studies the problem of contextual dueling bandits, where the binary comparison of dueling arms is generated from a generalized linear model ({GLM}). We propose a new {SupLinUCB}-type algorithm that enjoys computational efficiency and a variance-aware regret bound $\tilde{O}\big(d\sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2} + d\big)$, where $\sigma_t$ is the variance of the pairwise comparison at round $t$.},

While offline {RL} with linear function approximation has been extensively studied with optimal results achieved under certain assumptions, many works shift their interest to offline {RL} with non-linear function approximation. However, limited works on offline {RL} with non-linear function approximation have instance-dependent regret guarantees. In this paper, we propose an oracle-efficient algorithm, dubbed Pessimistic Nonlinear Least-Square Value Iteration ({PNLSVI}), for offline {RL} with non-linear function approximation. Our algorithmic design comprises three innovative components: (1) a variance-based weighted regression scheme that can be applied to a wide range of function classes, (2) a subroutine for variance estimation, and (3) a planning phase that utilizes a pessimistic value iteration approach. Our algorithm enjoys a regret bound that has a tight dependency on the function class complexity and achieves minimax optimal instance-dependent regret when specialized to linear function approximation.},

Existing approaches facilitate object discovery by representing objects as fixed-size vectors, called ``slots'' or ``object files''. While these approaches have shown promise in certain scenarios, they still exhibit certain limitations. First, they rely on architectural priors which can be unreliable and usually require meticulous engineering to identify the correct objects. Second, there has been a notable gap in investigating the practical utility of these representations in downstream tasks. To address the first limitation, we introduce a method that explicitly optimizes the constraint that each object in a scene should be associated with a distinct slot. We formalize this constraint by introducing consistency objectives which are cyclic in nature. By integrating these consistency objectives into various existing slot-based object-centric methods, we showcase substantial improvements in object-discovery performance. These enhancements consistently hold true across both synthetic and real-world scenes, underscoring the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed approach. To tackle the second limitation, we apply the learned object-centric representations from the proposed method to two downstream reinforcement learning tasks, demonstrating considerable performance enhancements compared to conventional slot-based and monolithic representation learning methods.},

Although {ELECTRA} offers a significant boost in efficiency, its potential is constrained by the training cost brought by the auxiliary model. Notably, this model, which is jointly trained with the main model, only serves to assist the training of the main model and is discarded post-training. This results in a substantial amount of training cost being expended in vain. To mitigate this issue, we propose {Fast-ELECTRA}, which leverages an existing language model as the auxiliary model. To construct a learning curriculum for the main model, we smooth its output distribution via temperature scaling following a descending schedule. Our approach rivals the performance of state-of-the-art {ELECTRA}-style pre-training methods, while significantly eliminating the computation and memory cost brought by the joint training of the auxiliary model.

To fill this gap, we explore the feasibility of training a teacher that is oriented toward student performance with empirical risk minimization ({ERM}). Our analyses are inspired by the recent findings that the effectiveness of knowledge distillation hinges on the teacher's capability to approximate the true label distribution of training inputs. We theoretically establish that {ERM} minimizer can approximate the true label distribution of training data as long as the feature extractor of the learner network is {Lipschitz} continuous and is robust to feature transformations. In light of our theory, we propose a teacher training method {SoTeacher} which incorporates {Lipschitz} regularization and consistency regularization into {ERM}.

To address these issues, we propose {AlignDiff}, a novel framework that leverages {RL} from Human Feedback ({RLHF}) to quantify human preferences, covering abstractness, and utilizes them to guide diffusion planning for zero-shot behavior customizing, covering mutability. {AlignDiff} can accurately match user-customized behaviors and efficiently switch from one to another. To build the framework, we first establish the multi-perspective human feedback datasets, which contain comparisons for the attributes of diverse behaviors, and then train an attribute strength model to predict quantified relative strengths. After relabeling behavioral datasets with relative strengths, we proceed to train an attribute-conditioned diffusion model, which serves as a planner with the attribute strength model as a director for preference aligning at the inference phase. We evaluate {AlignDiff} on various locomotion tasks and demonstrate its superior performance on preference matching, switching, and covering compared to other baselines. Its capability of completing unseen downstream tasks under human instructions also showcases the promising potential for human-{AI} collaboration.},

Graph canonization is known as a typical approach to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs, yet rarely adopted when developing expressive {GNNs}. This paper proposes to maximize the expressivity of {GNNs} by graph canonization, then the power of such {GNNs} is studies from the perspective of model stability. A stable {GNN} will map similar graphs to close graph representations in the vectorial space, and the stability of {GNNs} is critical to generalize their performance to unseen graphs. We theoretically reveal the trade-off of expressivity and stability in graph-canonization-enhanced {GNNs}. Then we introduce a notion of universal graph canonization as the general solution to address the trade-off and characterize a widely applicable sufficient condition to solve the universal graph canonization. In many popular graph benchmark datasets, graph canonization successfully enhances {GNNs} and provides highly competitive performance, indicating the capability and great potential of proposed method in general graph representation learning. In graph datasets where the sufficient condition holds, {GNNs} enhanced by universal graph canonization consistently outperform {GNN} baselines and successfully improve the {SOTA} performance up to 31\%, providing the optimal solution to numerous challenging real-world graph analytical tasks like gene network representation learning in bioinformatics.},

Previous research has demonstrated the ability to generate robots for various tasks, but these approaches often optimize robots directly in the vast design space, resulting in robots with complicated morphologies that are hard to control. In response, this paper presents a novel coarse-to-fine method for designing multi-cellular robots. Initially, this strategy seeks optimal coarse-grained robots and progressively refines them. To mitigate the challenge of determining the precise refinement juncture during the coarse-to-fine transition, we introduce the Hyperbolic Embeddings for Robot Design ({HERD}) framework. {HERD} unifies robots of various granularity within a shared hyperbolic space and leverages a refined Cross-Entropy Method for optimization. This framework enables our method to autonomously identify areas of exploration in hyperbolic space and concentrate on regions demonstrating promise. We evaluate our framework on 15 tasks in the benchmark {EvoGym} and demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both sample efficiency and final performance on most tasks.},

We consider an interpretable model where generalizing representations are understood analytically and are easily distinguishable from memorizing ones. We consider multi-layer perceptron ({MLP}) and Transformer architectures trained on modular arithmetic tasks where label corruption is introduced by incorrectly computing some of the operations. We show that it is possible for the network to memorize the corrupted labels and achieve 100\% generalization at the same time. The memorizing neurons can be identified and pruned, lowering the accuracy on corrupted data and improving the accuracy on uncorrupted data. Our work shows that grokking on modular addition dataset is remarkably robust to label corruption -- even without explicit regularization, the model can generalize to near 100\% accuracy with sizable label corruption. In many cases, the network surprisingly manages to correct some of the corrupted examples, resulting in test accuracy exceeding training accuracy. We provide mechanistic interpretations showing that regularization methods such as weight decay, dropout, and {BatchNorm} force the network to ignore the corrupted data during optimization, achieving 100\% accuracy on the uncorrupted dataset.},

These models provide powerful data priors that can solve linear inverse problems in zero shot through Bayesian posterior sampling. However, exact posterior sampling for diffusion models is intractable. Current solutions often hinge on approximations that are either computationally expensive or lack strong theoretical guarantees. In this work, we introduce an efficient diffusion sampling algorithm for linear inverse problems that is guaranteed to be asymptotically accurate. We reveal a link between Bayesian posterior sampling and Bayesian filtering in diffusion models, proving the former as a specific instance of the latter. Our method, termed filtering posterior sampling, leverages sequential Monte Carlo methods to solve the corresponding filtering problem. It seamlessly integrates with all Markovian diffusion samplers, requires no model re-training, and guarantees accurate samples from the Bayesian posterior as particle counts rise. Empirical tests demonstrate that our method generates better or comparable results than leading zero-shot diffusion posterior samplers on tasks like image inpainting, super-resolution, and deblurring.},

A notable subset of {MIM} methodologies employs discrete tokens as the reconstruction target, but the theoretical underpinnings of this choice remain underexplored. This paper explores the role of these discrete tokens, aiming to unravel their benefits and limitations. Building upon the connection between {MIM} and contrastive learning, we provide a comprehensive theoretical understanding on how discrete tokenization affects the model's generalization capabilities. We show that discrete tokens that align well with data classes enhance connectivity among intra-class samples, thereby improving the downstream performance. Conversely, incorrectly specified tokenizers may cause confusion between inter-class samples, resulting in poorer downstream performance. We design a novel metric, named token-class alignment similarity ({TCAS}), by measuring the discrepancy in distribution between true patch labels and the discrete token labels assigned by the tokenizer. {TCAS} can be used to directly compare the quality of different tokenizers without training. Furthermore, we design an easy-to-implement tokenizer with its corresponding {MIM} method named {ClusterMIM}, which demonstrates its efficacy through enhanced performance across different benchmark datasets and different {ViT} backbones.},

In the cascading bandit model, at each timestep, an agent recommends an ordered subset of items (called an item list) from a pool of items, each associated with an unknown attraction probability. However, the prior literature on cascading bandits ignores the influences of user states (e.g., historical behaviors) on recommendations and the change of states as the session proceeds. Motivated by this fact, we propose a generalized cascading {RL} framework, which considers the impact of user states and state transition into decisions. To tackle this challenge, we delve into the properties of value functions, and design an oracle {BestPerm} to efficiently find the optimal item list. Equipped with {BestPerm}, we develop two algorithms {CascadingVI} and {CascadingBPI}, which are both computation-efficient and sample-efficient, and provide near-optimal regret and sample complexity guarantees.

Particularly, using unlabeled data for out-of-distribution ({OOD}) detection is an important topic for trustworthy machine learning, but there is currently a lack of research on formally understanding how unlabeled data helps {OOD} detection. This paper bridges the gap by introducing a new learning framework {SAL} (Separate And Learn) that offers both strong theoretical guarantees and empirical effectiveness. The key idea is to separate candidate outliers from unlabeled data and then train an {OOD} classifier using the candidate outliers and the labeled in-distribution ({ID}) data. We provide rigorous error bounds from the lens of separability and learnability, formally justifying the two components in the algorithm. Our theory shows that {SAL} can separate the candidate outliers with small error rates, which leads to a generalization guarantee for the learned {OOD} classifier. Empirically, {SAL} achieves strong performance compared to competitive baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance on common benchmarks, echoing the theoretical insights.},

To address this shortcoming, we propose stack attention: an attention operator that incorporates stacks, inspired by their theoretical connections to context-free languages (CFLs). We show that stack attention is analogous to standard attention, but with a latent model of syntax that requires no syntactic supervision. We propose two variants: one related to deterministic pushdown automata (PDAs) and one based on nondeterministic PDAs, which allows transformers to recognize arbitrary CFLs.},

Despite the growing body of work aiming to minimise demographic bias in AI, this problem remains challenging. A key reason for this challenge is the fairness generalisation gap: High-capacity deep learning models can fit all training data nearly perfectly, and thus also exhibit perfect fairness during training. In this case, bias emerges only during testing when generalisation performance differs across sub-groups. This motivates us to take a bi-level optimisation perspective on fair learning: Optimising the learning strategy based on validation fairness. Specifically, we consider the highly effective workflow of adapting pre-trained models to downstream medical imaging tasks using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. We propose FairTune, a framework to optimise the choice of PEFT parameters with respect to fairness.},

The inference occurs in two major steps. First, pairwise non-linear affinities between neuronal traces from brain-wide calcium activity are organized by non-negative tensor factorization (NTF). Each factor specifies which groups of neurons are most likely interacting for an inferred interval in time, and for which animals. Finally, a generative model that allows for weighted community detection is applied to the functional motifs produced by NTF to reveal a dynamic functional connectome.},

@inproceedings{eftekhar2024selective,
  abstract = {Embodied {AI} models often employ off the shelf vision backbones like {CLIP} to encode their visual observations. Although such general purpose representations encode rich syntactic and semantic information about the scene, much of this information is often irrelevant to the specific task at hand. This introduces noise within the learning process and distracts the agent's focus from task-relevant visual cues. Inspired by selective attention in humans—the process through which people filter their perception based on their experiences, knowledge, and the task at hand—we introduce a parameter-efficient approach to filter visual stimuli for embodied {AI}. Our approach induces a task-conditioned bottleneck using a small learnable codebook module. This codebook is trained jointly to optimize task reward and acts as a task-conditioned selective filter over the visual observation. Our experiments showcase state-of-the-art performance for object goal navigation and object displacement across 5 benchmarks, {ProcTHOR}, {ArchitecTHOR}, {RoboTHOR}, {AI2-iTHOR}, and {ManipulaTHOR}. The filtered representations produced by the codebook are also able generalize better and converge faster when adapted to other simulation environments such as Habitat. Our qualitative analyses show that agents explore their environments more effectively and their representations retain task-relevant information like target object recognition while ignoring superfluous information about other objects.},

@inproceedings{eisner2024deep,
  abstract = {Many robot manipulation tasks can be framed as geometric reasoning tasks, where an agent must be able to precisely manipulate an object into a position that satisfies the task from a set of initial conditions. Often, task success is defined based on the relationship between two objects - for instance, hanging a mug on a rack. In such cases, the solution should be equivariant to the initial position of the objects as well as the agent, and invariant to the pose of the camera. This poses a challenge for learning systems which attempt to solve this task by learning directly from high-dimensional demonstrations: the agent must learn to be both equivariant as well as precise, which can be challenging without any inductive biases about the problem. In this work, we propose a method for precise relative pose prediction which is provably {SE(3)}-equivariant, can be learned from only a few demonstrations, and can generalize across variations in a class of objects. We accomplish this by factoring the problem into learning an {SE(3)} invariant task-specific representation of the scene and then interpreting this representation with novel geometric reasoning layers which are provably {SE(3)} equivariant. We demonstrate that our method can yield substantially more precise placement predictions in simulated placement tasks than previous methods trained with the same amount of data, and can accurately represent relative placement relationships data collected from real-world demonstrations.},

These requirements can be imposed through constrained learning problems that are tackled by dual ascent algorithms. While these algorithms converge in objective value even in non-convex settings, they do not guarantee feasible solutions. Traditionally, this issue is addressed by randomizing over all iterates, which is impractical for modern applications. In this work, we address this gap between theory and practice by characterizing the constraint violation of Lagrangian minimizers associated with optimal dual variables, despite lack of convexity. We characterize both the sub-optimality and infeasibility of primal solutions obtained by dual algorithms. For sufficiently rich parametrizations, we show that solutions obtained by dual algorithms closely approximate functional solutions in both optimal value and constraint satisfaction.

We introduce two new random projection variants of approximate {eNTK} which allow users to tune the time and memory complexity of their calculation. We find strong connections between the neural network model and an approximation to a special kernel called the empirical neural tangent kernel, which we call the trace neural tangent kernel. We show that kernel machines using approximate neural tangent kernel as the kernel function are effective surrogate models, with the introduced trace {NTK} being the most consistent performer. Our results challenge the assumption that explanations-by-example of neural network behavior are sparse, providing evidence that every single point in the training dataset generally contributes to the behavior of the model on new data.

More recently, first works on open-vocabulary {3D} scene segmentation have emerged, which enable queries of arbitrary concepts from {3D} scene representations. In this work, we present {OpenNeRF}, which naturally operates on posed images and directly encodes {VLM} features within the {NeRF}.

For {3D} point cloud segmentation on the Replica dataset, {OpenNeRF} outperforms recent open-vocabulary methods such as {LERF} and {OpenScene} by at least +4.9 {mIoU}.

In this work, we present a unified method that seamlessly combines loss reweighting and label correction. Specifically, by leveraging ideas from compositional data analysis in statistics, we frame the problem as a regression task, where loss reweighting and label correction can naturally be achieved with a shifted Gaussian label noise model.

This duality requires an inherently invertible architecture, and the requirement of invertibility imposes constraints on their expressiveness, necessitating a large number of parameters and innovative architectural designs to achieve good results. The issue of over-parameterisation in flow-based models hinders their effectiveness in domains with limited data. In this paper, we present kernelised normalising flows, a novel paradigm that integrates kernels into the framework of normalising flows. Kernels can replace neural networks in coupling layers or autoregressive layers, reducing the number of parameters while maintaining or improving performance, especially in the low-data regime. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets, showing that kernelised normalising flows can achieve competitive or superior performance compared to traditional neural network-based flows while using significantly fewer parameters. We also apply our method to a real-world medical dataset, the {UK} Biobank, demonstrating its potential in practical applications where data is scarce and interpretability is crucial.},

@inproceedings{esfandiarpoor2024followup,
  abstract = {A promising approach for improving the performance of vision-language models like CLIP for image classification is to extend the class descriptions (i.e., prompts) with related attributes, e.g., using brown sparrow instead of sparrow. However, current zero-shot methods select a subset of attributes regardless of commonalities between the target classes, potentially providing no useful information that would have helped to distinguish between them. For instance, they may use color instead of bill shape to distinguish between sparrows and wrens, which are both brown. We propose Follow-up Differential Descriptions (FuDD), a zero-shot approach that tailors the class descriptions to each dataset and leads to additional attributes that better differentiate the target classes. FuDD first identifies the ambiguous classes for each image, and then uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate new class descriptions that differentiate between them. The new class descriptions resolve the initial ambiguity and help predict the correct label. In our experiments, FuDD consistently outperforms generic description ensembles and naive LLM-generated descriptions on 12 datasets. We show that differential descriptions are an effective tool to resolve class ambiguities, which otherwise significantly degrade the performance. We also show that high quality natural language class descriptions produced by FuDD result in comparable performance to few-shot adaptation methods.},

  abstract = {In few-shot recognition, a classifier that has been trained on one set of classes is required to rapidly adapt and generalize to a disjoint, novel set of classes. To that end, recent studies have shown the efficacy of fine-tuning with carefully crafted adaptation architectures. However this raises the question of: How can one design the optimal adaptation strategy? In this paper, we study this question through the lens of neural architecture search (NAS). Given a pre-trained neural network, our algorithm discovers the optimal arrangement of adapters, which layers to keep frozen and which to fine-tune. We demonstrate the generality of our NAS method by applying it to both residual networks and vision transformers and report state-of-the-art performance on Meta-Dataset and Meta-Album.},

@inproceedings{eyring2024unbalancedness,
  abstract = {In optimal transport (OT), a Monge map is known as a mapping that transports a source distribution to a target distribution in the most cost-efficient way. Recently, multiple neural estimators for Monge maps have been developed and applied in diverse unpaired domain translation tasks, e.g. in single-cell biology and computer vision. However, the classic OT framework enforces mass conservation, which makes it prone to outliers and limits its applicability in real-world scenarios. The latter can be particularly harmful in OT domain translation tasks, where the relative position of a sample within a distribution is explicitly taken into account. While unbalanced OT tackles this challenge in the discrete setting, its integration into neural Monge map estimators has received limited attention. We propose a theoretically grounded method to incorporate unbalancedness into any Monge map estimator. We improve existing estimators to model cell trajectories over time and to predict cellular responses to perturbations. Moreover, our approach seamlessly integrates with the OT flow matching (OT-FM) framework. While we show that OT-FM performs competitively in image translation, we further improve performance by incorporating unbalancedness (UOT-FM), which better preserves relevant features. We hence establish UOT-FM as a principled method for unpaired image translation.},

@inproceedings{fabian2024learning,
  abstract = {Learning the behavior of large agent populations is an important task for numerous research areas. Although the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant progress towards solving these systems, solutions for many agents often remain computationally infeasible and lack theoretical guarantees. Mean Field Games (MFGs) address both of these issues and can be extended to Graphon MFGs (GMFGs) to include network structures between agents. Despite their merits, the real world applicability of GMFGs is limited by the fact that graphons only capture dense graphs. Since most empirically observed networks show some degree of sparsity, such as power law graphs, the GMFG framework is insufficient for capturing these network topologies. Thus, we introduce the novel concept of Graphex MFGs (GXMFGs) which builds on the graph theoretical concept of graphexes. Graphexes are the limiting objects to sparse graph sequences that also have other desirable features such as the small world property. Learning equilibria in these games is challenging due to the rich and sparse structure of the underlying graphs. To tackle these challenges, we design a new learning algorithm tailored to the GXMFG setup. This hybrid graphex learning approach leverages that the system mainly consists of a highly connected core and a sparse periphery. After defining the system and providing a theoretical analysis, we state our learning approach and demonstrate its learning capabilities on both synthetic graphs and real-world networks. This comparison shows that our GXMFG learning algorithm successfully extends MFGs to a highly relevant class of hard, realistic learning problems that are not accurately addressed by current MARL and MFG methods.},

An essential aspect is accurately estimating the carbon impact of emerging LLMs even before their training, which heavily relies on GPU usage. Existing studies have reported the carbon footprint of LLM training, but only one tool, mlco2, can predict the carbon footprint of new neural networks prior to physical training. However, mlco2 has several serious limitations. It cannot extend its estimation to dense or mixture-of-experts (MoE) LLMs, disregards critical architectural parameters, focuses solely on GPUs, and cannot model embodied carbon footprints. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end carbon footprint projection model, LLMCarbon, which can accurately predict the carbon footprint of both dense and MoE LLMs during their training, inference, experimentation, and storage phases. LLMCarbon incorporates critical LLM, hardware, and data center parameters, such as LLM parameter count, hardware type, system power, chip area, and data center efficiency, to model both operational and embodied carbon footprints of an LLM.},

While no model can work when data evolves in an arbitrary fashion, if there is some pattern to these changes, we might be able to design methods to address it. This paper addresses situations when data evolves gradually. We introduce a time-varying propensity score that can detect gradual shifts in the distribution of data which allows us to selectively sample past data to update the model -- not just similar data from the past like that of a standard propensity score but also data that evolved in a similar fashion in the past. The time-varying propensity score is quite general: we demonstrate different ways of implementing it and evaluate it on a variety of problems ranging from supervised learning (e.g., image classification problems) where data undergoes a sequence of gradual shifts, to reinforcement learning tasks (e.g., robotic manipulation and continuous control) where data shifts as the policy or the task changes.},

Our approach is based on the observation that when the sampling of variables in a PGM is seen as a sequence of actions taken by an agent, sparsity of the PGM enables local credit assignment in the agent's policy learning objective. This yields a local constraint that can be turned into a local loss in the style of generative flow networks (GFlowNets) that enables off-policy training but avoids the need to instantiate all the random variables for each parameter update, thus speeding up training considerably. The Δ-AI objective matches the conditional distribution of a variable given its Markov blanket in a tractable learned sampler, which has the structure of a Bayesian network, with the same conditional distribution under the target PGM. As such, the trained sampler recovers marginals and conditional distributions of interest and enables inference of partial subsets of variables.},

Vertical federated learning or feature-based federated learning applies to the cases that different data sources share the same sample ID space but differ in feature space. To ensure the data owners' long-term engagement, it is critical to objectively assess the contribution from each data source and recompense them accordingly. The Shapley value (SV) is a provably fair contribution valuation metric originated from cooperative game theory. However, computing the SV requires extensively retraining the model on each subset of data sources, which causes prohibitively high communication costs in federated learning. We propose a contribution valuation metric called vertical federated Shapley value (VerFedSV) based on SV. We show that VerFedSV not only satisfies many desirable properties for fairness but is also efficient to compute, and can be adapted to both synchronous and asynchronous vertical federated learning algorithms. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results verify the fairness, efficiency, and adaptability of VerFedSV.},

However, the effective utilization of their strong modeling ability in the probabilistic time series forecasting task remains an open question, partially due to the challenge of instability arising from their stochastic nature. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Multi-Granularity Time Series Diffusion ({MG-TSD}) model, which achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance by leveraging the inherent granularity levels within the data as given targets at intermediate diffusion steps to guide the learning process of diffusion models. The way to construct the targets is motivated by the observation that the forward process of the diffusion model, which sequentially corrupts the data distribution to a standard normal distribution, intuitively aligns with the process of smoothing fine-grained data into a coarse-grained representation, both of which result in a gradual loss of fine distribution features. In the study, we derive a novel multi-granularity guidance diffusion loss function and propose a concise implementation method to effectively utilize coarse-grained data across various granularity levels. More importantly, our approach does not rely on additional external data, making it versatile and applicable across various domains. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our {MG-TSD} model outperforms existing time series prediction methods.},

With hundreds of graph pre-training tasks proposed, integrating knowledge acquired from multiple pre-training tasks has become a popular research topic. In this paper, we identify two important collaborative processes for this topic: (1) select: how to select an optimal task combination from a given task pool based on their compatibility, and (2) weigh: how to weigh the selected tasks based on their importance. However, current approaches mainly focus on the task weighing process and neglect the necessary of task selection, leading to sub-optimal performance and efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a novel instance-level framework called Weigh And Select ({WAS}), where the two collaborative processes of weighing and selecting are combined by decoupled siamese networks. Specifically, the framework first adaptively learns an optimal combination of tasks for each instance from a given task pool, based on which a customized instance-level task weighing strategy is learned. Extensive experiments on 16 graph datasets across node-level and graph-level downstream tasks demonstrated that by combining a few simple but classical tasks, {WAS} can achieve comparable performance to other leading counterparts. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to use the weighing \& selecting strategy for integrating multiple graph pre-training tasks.},

It demonstrates the low-rank property by decomposing the grid-structured data as interactions between a core tensor and a set of object representations (factors). However, a fundamental assumption of such decomposition is that there are finite objects in each aspect or mode, corresponding to discrete indexes of data entries. However, real-world data is often not naturally posed in this setting. For example, geographic data is represented as continuous indexes of latitude and longitude coordinates, and cannot fit tensor models directly. To address this limitation, we propose Functional {Bayesian} {Tucker} Decomposition ({FunBaT}). We treat the continuous-indexed data as the interaction between the {Tucker} core and a group of latent functions. We use {Gaussian} processes ({GP}) as functional priors to model the latent functions. We convert each {GP} into a state-space prior by constructing an equivalent stochastic differential equation ({SDE}) to reduce computational cost.

In our quest for effective uniformity metrics, we pinpoint four principled properties that such metrics should possess. Namely, an effective uniformity metric should remain invariant to instance permutations and sample replications while accurately capturing feature redundancy and dimensional collapse. Surprisingly, we find that the uniformity metric proposed by Wang \& Isola (2020) fails to satisfy the majority of these properties. Specifically, their metric is sensitive to sample replications, and cannot account for feature redundancy and dimensional collapse correctly. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new uniformity metric based on the {Wasserstein} distance, which satisfies all the aforementioned properties.

While modern deep learning models have been applied to these tasks through plug-and-play or deep unrolling frameworks, there is no guarantee that a general deep network represents the proximal operator of any function, nor is there any characterization of the function for which the network might provide some approximate proximal. We address these points by developing a new class of deep neural networks -- learned proximal networks ({LPN}) -- that exactly implement the proximal operator of a general learned function. Such an {LPN} implicitly learns a regularization function for inverse problems that can be characterized and evaluated, shedding light onto what has been learned from data and improving the interpretability of learning-based solutions. We also present a new training problem, dubbed proximal matching, that provably promotes the recovery of the correct regularization term (i.e., the log of the data distribution). In contrast to {MMSE} denoising, we prove that in the limit of small scale parameter γ, training a denoiser by minimizing the proximal matching loss recovers the correct log-prior.

To enable efficient and scalable computation on massive collocation points, which are critical to capture high frequencies, we place the collocation points on a grid, and multiply our covariance function at each input dimension. As a result, we can derive a {Kronecker} product structure in the covariance matrix. We use {Kronecker} product properties and multilinear algebra to promote computational efficiency and scalability, without low-rank approximations. We introduce {GP-HM}, a {GP} solver for High frequency and Multi-scale {PDEs}, and demonstrate the first to realize its rationale and benefit for solving high-frequency and multi-scale {PDEs}.},

We introduce the {ACRF} (Attributed Compression of Radiance Field) framework which focuses on compressing explicit neural 3D representations. The neural 3D structure is pruned and converted to points with features, which are further encoded using importance-guided feature encoding. The framework employs an importance-prioritized entropy model to estimate the probability distribution of transform coefficients, which are then entropy coded with an arithmetic coder using the predicted distribution. Within this framework, we present two models: {ACRF} and {ACRF-F}, to strike a balance between compression performance and encoding time budget. Explicit {NeRF} models facilitate practical {NeRF} applications with faster rendering speed, and also attract considerable attention in {NeRF} compression due to their huge storage cost.},

@inproceedings{fang2024data,
  abstract = {Large training sets have become a cornerstone of machine learning and are the foundation for recent advances in language modeling and multimodal learning. While data curation for pre-training is often still ad-hoc, one common paradigm is to first collect a massive pool of data from the Web and then filter this candidate pool down to an actual training set via various heuristics. In this work, we study the problem of learning a data filtering network ({DFN}) for this second step of filtering a large uncurated dataset. Our key finding is that the quality of a network for filtering is distinct from its performance on downstream tasks: for instance, a model that performs well on {ImageNet} can yield worse training sets than a model with low {ImageNet} accuracy that is trained on a small amount of high-quality data. Based on our insights, we construct new data filtering networks that induce state-of-the-art image-text datasets. Specifically, our best performing dataset {DFN-5B} enables us to train state-of-the-art {CLIP} models for their compute budgets: among other improvements on a variety of tasks, a {ViT-H} trained on our dataset achieves 84.4\% zero-shot transfer accuracy on {ImageNet}, out-performing models trained on other datasets such as {LAION-2B}, {DataComp-1B}, or {OpenAI}'s {WIT}.},

  abstract = {With the advancement of data science, the collection of increasingly complex datasets has become commonplace. In such datasets, the data dimension can be extremely high, and the underlying data generation process can be unknown and highly nonlinear. As a result, the task of making causal inference with high-dimensional complex data has become a fundamental problem in many disciplines, such as medicine, econometrics, and social science. However, the existing methods for causal inference are frequently developed under the assumption that the data dimension is low or that the underlying data generation process is linear or approximately linear. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel causal inference approach for dealing with high-dimensional complex data. The proposed approach is based on deep learning techniques, including sparse deep learning theory and stochastic neural networks, that have been developed in recent literature. By using these techniques, the proposed approach can address both the high dimensionality and unknown data generation process in a coherent way. Furthermore, the proposed approach can also be used when missing values are present in the datasets. Extensive numerical studies indicate that the proposed approach outperforms existing ones.},

This is supported by trends in deep reinforcement learning ({RL}), where self-supervised auxiliary objectives such as prediction are widely used to support representation learning and improve task performance. Here, we study the effects predictive auxiliary objectives have on representation learning across different modules of an {RL} system and how these mimic representational changes observed in the brain. We find that predictive objectives improve and stabilize learning particularly in resource-limited architectures, and we identify settings where longer predictive horizons better support representational transfer. Furthermore, we find that representational changes in this {RL} system bear a striking resemblance to changes in neural activity observed in the brain across various experiments. The auxiliary predictive model corresponds to the hippocampus (an area thought to learn a predictive model to support memory-guided behavior), while the encoder network and value learning network correspond to visual cortex and striatum in the brain, respectively. This work demonstrates how representation learning in deep {RL} systems can provide an interpretable framework for modeling multi-region interactions in the brain.},

While the original formulation assumes data exchangeability, some extensions handle non-exchangeable data, which is often the case in many real-world scenarios. In parallel, some progress has been made in conformal methods that provide statistical guarantees for a broader range of objectives, such as bounding the best F₁-score or minimizing the false negative rate in expectation.

However, accurately simulating large-scale systems at long time scales is computationally expensive due to the short time steps required for accurate integration.

To achieve this, we propose Time-lagged Information Bottleneck ({T-IB}), a principled objective rooted in information theory, which aims to capture relevant temporal features while discarding high-frequency information to simplify the simulation task and minimize the inference error.

In this paper, we overcome this challenge by leveraging dependencies between the target variable and a set of correlated variables (covariates) that can frequently be associated with each location of interest. From this viewpoint, covariates provide partial observability, and the problem consists of inferring values for unobserved channels by exploiting observations at other locations to learn how such variables can correlate.

Different from existing pre-training approaches which treat proteins and ligands individually, we emphasize to discern the intricate binding patterns from fine-grained interactions. Specifically, this self-supervised learning problem is formulated as a prediction of the conclusive binding complex structure given a pocket and ligand with a Transformer based interaction module, which naturally emulates the binding process. To ensure the representation of rich binding information, we introduce two pre-training tasks, i.e. atomic pairwise distance map prediction and mask ligand reconstruction, which comprehensively model the fine-grained interactions from both structure and feature space.

However, it is noticed that the high-order modeling capability of hypergraph also brings increased computation complexity, which hinders its practical industrial deployment. In practice, we find that one key barrier to the efficient deployment of {HGNNs} is the high-order structural dependencies during inference. In this paper, we propose to bridge the gap between the {HGNNs} and inference-efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron ({MLPs}) to eliminate the hypergraph dependency of {HGNNs} and thus reduce computational complexity as well as improve inference speed. Specifically, we introduce {LightHGNN} and {LightHGNN+} for fast inference with low complexity. {LightHGNN} directly distills the knowledge from teacher {HGNNs} to student {MLPs} via soft labels, and {LightHGNN+} further explicitly injects reliable high-order correlations into the student {MLPs} to achieve topology-aware distillation and resistance to over-smoothing. Experiments on eight hypergraph datasets demonstrate that even without hypergraph dependency, the proposed {LightHGNNs} can still achieve competitive or even better performance than {HGNNs} and outperform vanilla {MLPs} by 16.3 on average. Extensive experiments on three graph datasets further show the average best performance of our {LightHGNNs} compared with all other methods.

As they are increasingly adopted for knowledge-intensive tasks, it becomes evident that these design choices lead to failures to generate factual, relevant, and up-to-date knowledge. To this end, we propose Knowledge Card, a modular framework to plug in new factual and relevant knowledge into general-purpose {LLMs}. We first introduce knowledge cards -- specialized language models trained on corpora from specific domains and sources. Knowledge cards serve as parametric repositories that are selected at inference time to generate background knowledge for the base {LLM}. We then propose three content selectors to dynamically select and retain information in documents generated by knowledge cards, specifically controlling for relevance, brevity, and factuality of outputs. Finally, we propose two complementary integration approaches to augment the base {LLM} with the (relevant, factual) knowledge curated from the specialized {LMs}. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Knowledge Card achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmark datasets. Ultimately, Knowledge Card framework enables dynamic synthesis and updates of knowledge from diverse domains. Its modularity will ensure that relevant knowledge can be continuously updated through the collective efforts of the research community.},

  abstract = {Prompts play a crucial role in guiding the responses of Large Language Models ({LLMs}). However, the intricate role of individual tokens in prompts, known as input saliency, in shaping the responses remains largely underexplored. Existing saliency methods either misalign with {LLM} generation objectives or rely heavily on linearity assumptions, leading to potential inaccuracies. To address this, we propose Token Distribution Dynamics ({TDD}), an elegantly simple yet remarkably effective approach to unveil and manipulate the role of prompts in generating {LLM} outputs. {TDD} leverages the robust interpreting capabilities of the language model head ({LM} head) to assess input saliency. It projects input tokens into the embedding space and then estimates their significance based on distribution dynamics over the vocabulary. We introduce three {TDD} variants: forward, backward, and bidirectional, each offering unique insights into token relevance. Extensive experiments reveal that the {TDD} surpasses state-of-the-art baselines with a big margin in elucidating the causal relationships between prompts and {LLM} outputs. Beyond mere interpretation, we apply {TDD} to two prompt manipulation tasks for controlled text generation: zero-shot toxic language suppression and sentiment steering. Empirical results underscore {TDD}'s proficiency in identifying both toxic and sentimental cues in prompts, subsequently mitigating toxicity or modulating sentiment in the generated content.},

  abstract = {Sampling complex distributions is a fundamental challenge across numerous fields in physics, chemistry, and statistics. Parallel tempering (also called replica exchange Monte Carlo) is a popular approach for sampling multimodal distributions, which runs sequences of Markov chains at decreasing temperatures in parallel that can swap configurations. In this work, we apply similar parallel tempering ideas to Restricted Boltzmann Machines ({RBMs}), which are unsupervised architectures capable of learning complex, multimodal distributions. Inspired by Deep Tempering (an approach for deep belief networks), we propose to learn a stack of nested {RBMs} on top of the first {RBM}, using the representations of one {RBM} as data for the next level. We show that this hierarchical approach can significantly accelerate sampling from the base distribution and improve the exploration of multimodal distributions.},

Recent literature has begun to systematically investigate differences in the structural properties that these approaches encode, as well as performance trade-offs between them. However, the question of which structural properties yield the most effective encoding remains open. In this paper, we investigate this question from a geometric perspective. We propose a novel structural encoding based on discrete Ricci curvature (Local Curvature Profiles, short {LCP}). The main idea is that curvature information of edges away from the extremes of the curvature distribution, which is not being used by curvature-based rewiring methods, can be beneficial to {GNN} performance. We show that {LCP} consistently improves performance across a diverse set of datasets and {GNN} architectures, and further demonstrate that it can be combined with existing structural encodings to achieve even better results.},

Stronger decoding methods, including Quality Estimation ({QE}) reranking and Minimum Bayes' Risk ({MBR}) decoding, have since been proposed to mitigate the model-perplexity-vs-quality mismatch. While these decoding methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they are prohibitively expensive to compute. In this work, we propose {MBR} finetuning and {QE} finetuning which distill the quality gains from these decoding methods at training time, while using an efficient decoding algorithm at inference time. Using the canonical {NLG} task of Neural Machine Translation ({NMT}), we show that even with self-training, these finetuning methods significantly outperform the base model. Moreover, when using an external {LLM} as a teacher model, these finetuning methods outperform finetuning on human-generated references.},

We provide a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of the truncation sampling by proving that truncation methods that discard tokens below some probability threshold (the most common type of truncation) can guarantee that all sampled tokens have nonzero true probability. However, thresholds are a coarse heuristic, and necessarily discard some tokens with nonzero true probability as well. In pursuit of a more precise sampling strategy, we show that we can leverage a known source of model errors, the softmax bottleneck, to prove that certain tokens have nonzero true probability, without relying on a threshold.},

Desired characteristics for an AI agent can be expressed by assigning desirability scores, which we assume are not assigned to individual behaviors but to collective trajectories. For example, in a dataset of vehicle interactions, these scores might relate to the number of incidents that occurred. We first assess the effect of each individual agent's behavior on the collective desirability score, e.g., assessing how likely an agent is to cause incidents. This allows us to selectively imitate agents with a positive effect, e.g., only imitating agents that are unlikely to cause incidents. To enable this, we propose the concept of an agent's Exchange Value, which quantifies an individual agent's contribution to the collective desirability score. The Exchange Value is the expected change in desirability score when substituting the agent for a randomly selected agent. We propose additional methods for estimating Exchange Values from real-world datasets, enabling us to learn desired imitation policies that outperform relevant baselines.},

Detectability is undesirable to adversaries as it may trigger security escalations. We introduce ε-attacks, a novel form of adversarial attack on sequential decision-makers that is both effective and of ε-bounded statistical detectability. We propose a novel dual ascent algorithm to learn such attacks end-to-end. Compared to existing attacks, we empirically find ε-attacks to be significantly harder to detect with automated methods, and a small study with human participants suggests they are similarly harder to detect for humans.

To solve this problem, we propose VQScore, a self-supervised metric for evaluating speech based on the quantization error of a vector-quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The training of VQ-VAE relies on clean speech; hence, large quantization errors can be expected when the speech is distorted. To further improve correlation with real quality scores, domain knowledge of speech processing is incorporated into the model design. We found that the vector quantization mechanism could also be used for self-supervised speech enhancement (SE) model training.

  abstract = {Deep features often lack the spatial resolution to directly perform dense prediction tasks like segmentation and depth prediction because models aggressively pool information over large areas. We introduce FeatUp, a task- and model-agnostic framework to restore lost spatial information in deep features. We introduce two variants of FeatUp: one that guides features with high-resolution signal in a single forward pass, and one that fits an implicit model to a single image to reconstruct features at any resolution. Both approaches use a multi-view consistency loss with deep analogies to NeRFs. Our features retain their original semantics and can be swapped into existing applications to yield resolution and performance gains even without re-training. We show that FeatUp significantly improves performance on a variety of dense prediction tasks and outperforms alternative feature upsampling and image super-resolution approaches.},

However, human instructions are sometimes too brief for current methods to capture and follow. We investigate how multimodal large language models (MLLMs) facilitate edit instructions and present MLLM-Guided Image Editing (MGIE). MGIE learns to derive expressive instructions and provides explicit guidance. The editing model jointly captures this visual imagination and performs manipulation through end-to-end training. We evaluate various aspects of Photoshop-style modification, global photo optimization, and local editing.

However, conventional graph transformers perform dense attention for every pair of nodes, resulting in quadratic computational costs that are unaffordable for large-scale graph data. We address this issue through two key innovations: PPR tokenization that assigns each node a token list sampled by personalized PageRank, enabling mini-batch training by decoupling model training from complex graph topology; and virtual connections that rewire graphs through structure- and content-based super nodes to encode local and global contexts, long-range interaction, and heterophilous information.

We introduce Neural Fields incorporating scene Priors ({NFPs}) to address these limitations. The {NFP} network maps any single-view {RGB}-{D} image into signed distance and radiance values. A complete scene can be reconstructed by merging individual frames in the volumetric space without a fusion module, which provides better flexibility. The key insight is to incorporate geometry and appearance priors learned from large-scale datasets during training, enabling fast adaptation to the reconstruction of a new scene with fewer views. We parameterize the distance and radiance fields as functions of the extracted features. The {NFP} network is trained in two stages: first learning the geometric prior from {RGB}-{D} pairs, then learning the appearance prior from {RGB} images. Experiments show that {NFP} can reconstruct scenes with as few as 2-5 views, significantly outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction quality and efficiency.},

The problem is challenging, however, as it requires both predicting with arbitrary feature sets and learning a policy to identify valuable selections. We take an information-theoretic perspective and prioritize features based on their mutual information with the response variable. The main challenge is implementing this policy, and we design a new approach that estimates the mutual information in a discriminative rather than generative fashion.

While excelling in generating images from short, single-object descriptions, these models often struggle to faithfully capture all the nuanced details within longer and more elaborate textual inputs. In response, we present a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models ({LLMs}) to extract critical components from text prompts, including bounding box coordinates for foreground objects, detailed textual descriptions for individual objects, and a succinct background context. These components form the foundation of our layout-to-image generation model, which operates in two phases. The initial Global Scene Generation utilizes object layouts and background context to create an initial scene but often falls short in faithfully representing object characteristics as specified in the prompts. To address this limitation, we introduce an Iterative Refinement Scheme that iteratively evaluates and refines box-level content to align them with their textual descriptions, recomposing objects as needed to ensure consistency. Our evaluation on complex prompts featuring multiple objects demonstrates a substantial improvement in recall compared to baseline diffusion models. This is further validated by a user study, underscoring the efficacy of our approach in generating coherent and detailed scenes from intricate textual inputs.},

  abstract = {Large vision-language models ({VLMs}) such as {GPT}-4 have achieved exceptional performance across various multi-modal tasks. However, the deployment of {VLMs} necessitates substantial energy consumption and computational resources. Once attackers maliciously induce high energy consumption and latency time (energy-latency cost) during inference of {VLMs}, it will exhaust computational resources. In this paper, we explore this attack surface about availability of {VLMs} and aim to induce high energy-latency cost during inference of {VLMs}. We find that high energy-latency cost during inference of {VLMs} can be manipulated by maximizing the length of generated sequences. To this end, we propose verbose images, with the goal of crafting an imperceptible perturbation to induce {VLMs} to generate long sentences during inference. Concretely, we design three loss objectives. First, a loss is proposed to delay the occurrence of end-of-sequence ({EOS}) token, where {EOS} token is a signal for {VLMs} to stop generating further tokens. Moreover, an uncertainty loss and a token diversity loss are proposed to increase the uncertainty over each generated token and the diversity among all tokens of the whole generated sequence, respectively, which can break output dependency at token-level and sequence-level. Furthermore, a temporal weight adjustment algorithm is proposed, which can effectively balance these losses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our verbose images can increase the length of generated sequences by 7.87$\times$ and 8.56$\times$ compared to original images on {MS}-{COCO} and {ImageNet} datasets, which presents potential challenges for various applications.},

While much attention has been devoted to addressing the challenge using fully observational data, there has been comparatively limited exploration of this issue in cases when the treatment is not directly observed. In this paper, we tackle this problem by developing a general variational framework, which is flexible to integrate with advanced neural network-based approaches, to identify the average dose-response function ({ADRF}) with the continuously valued error-contaminated treatments. In this model, we leverage a learnable density estimation neural network to derive its prior distribution conditioned on covariates. This module also doubles as a generalized propensity score estimator, effectively mitigating selection bias arising from observed confounding variables. Subsequently, we calculate the posterior distribution of the treatment, taking into account the observed measurement and outcome. To mitigate the impact of treatment error, we introduce a re-parametrized treatment value, replacing the error-affected one, to make more accurate predictions regarding the outcome. To demonstrate the adaptability of our framework, we incorporate two state-of-the-art {ADRF} estimation methods and rigorously assess its efficacy through extensive simulations and experiments using semi-synthetic data.},

  abstract = {{AlphaFold} can be used for both single-chain and multi-chain protein structure prediction, while the latter becomes extremely challenging as the number of chains increases. In this work, by taking each chain as a node and assembly actions as edges, we show that an acyclic undirected connected graph can be used to predict the structure of multi-chain protein complexes (a.k.a., protein complex modelling, {PCM}). However, there are still two challenges: 1) The huge combinatorial optimization space of $N^{N-2}$ ($N$ is the number of chains) for the {PCM} problem can easily lead to high computational cost. 2) The scales of protein complexes exhibit distribution shift due to variance in chain numbers, which calls for the generalization in modelling complexes of various chains. To address these challenges, we propose {GAPN}, a Generative Adversarial Policy Network powered by domain-specific rewards and adversarial loss through policy gradient for automatic {PCM} prediction. Specifically, {GAPN} learns to efficiently search through the immense assembly space and optimize the direct docking reward through policy gradient. Importantly, we design an adversarial reward function to enhance the receptive field of our model. In this way, {GAPN} will simultaneously focus on a specific batch of complexes and the global assembly rules learned from complexes with varied chain numbers. Empirically, we have achieved both significant accuracy (measured by {RMSD} and {TM}-Score) and efficiency improvements compared to leading {PCM} softwares.},

  abstract = {In the realm of reinforcement learning ({RL}), off-policy evaluation ({OPE}) holds a pivotal position, especially in high-stake human-involved scenarios such as e-learning and healthcare. Applying {OPE} to these domains is often challenging with scarce and underrepresentative offline training trajectories. Data augmentation has been a successful technique to enrich training data. However, directly employing existing data augmentation methods to {OPE} may not be feasible, due to the Markovian nature within the offline trajectories and the desire for generalizability across diverse target policies. In this work, we propose an offline trajectory augmentation approach to specifically facilitate {OPE} in human-involved scenarios. We propose sub-trajectory mining to extract potentially valuable sub-trajectories from offline data, and diversify the behaviors within those sub-trajectories by varying coverage of the state-action space. Our work was empirically evaluated in a wide array of environments, encompassing both simulated scenarios and real-world domains like robotic control, healthcare, and e-learning, where the training trajectories include varying levels of coverage of the state-action space. By enhancing the performance of a variety of {OPE} methods, our work offers a promising path forward for tackling {OPE} challenges in situations where data may be limited or underrepresentative.},

@inproceedings{gao2024econtrol,
  abstract = {Modern distributed training relies heavily on communication compression to reduce the communication overhead. In this work, we study algorithms employing a popular class of contractive compressors in order to reduce communication overhead. However, the naive implementation often leads to unstable convergence or even exponential divergence due to the compression bias. Error Compensation ({EC}) is an extremely popular mechanism to mitigate the aforementioned issues during the training of models enhanced by contractive compression operators. Compared to the effectiveness of {EC} in the data homogeneous regime, the understanding of the practicality and theoretical foundations of {EC} in the data heterogeneous regime is limited. Existing convergence analyses typically rely on strong assumptions such as bounded gradients, bounded data heterogeneity, or large batch accesses, which are often infeasible in modern Machine Learning Applications. We resolve the majority of current issues by proposing {EControl}, a novel mechanism that can regulate error compensation by controlling the strength of the feedback signal. We prove fast convergence for {EControl} in standard strongly convex, general convex, and nonconvex settings without any additional assumptions on the problem or data heterogeneity. We conduct extensive numerical evaluations to illustrate the efficacy of our method and support our theoretical findings.},

@inproceedings{gao2024selfsupervised,
  abstract = {Pocket representations play a vital role in various biomedical applications, such as druggability estimation, ligand affinity prediction, and de novo drug design. While existing geometric features and pretrained representations have demonstrated promising results, they usually treat pockets independent of ligands, neglecting the fundamental interactions between them. However, the limited pocket-ligand complex structures available in the {PDB} database (less than 100 thousand non-redundant pairs) hampers large-scale pretraining endeavors for interaction modeling. To address this constraint, we propose a novel pocket pretraining approach that leverages knowledge from high-resolution atomic protein structures, assisted by highly effective pretrained small molecule representations. By segmenting protein structures into drug-like fragments and their corresponding pockets, we obtain a reasonable simulation of ligand-receptor interactions, resulting in the generation of over 5 million complexes. Subsequently, the pocket encoder is trained in a contrastive manner to align with the representation of pseudo-ligand furnished by some pretrained small molecule encoders. Our method, named {ProFSA}, achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, including pocket druggability prediction, pocket matching, and ligand binding affinity prediction. Notably, {ProFSA} surpasses other pretraining methods by a substantial margin. Moreover, our work opens up a new avenue for mitigating the scarcity of protein-ligand complex data through the utilization of high-quality and diverse protein structure databases.},

Despite its significant importance, the fundamental question of ''what are the most effective algorithms for OOD generalization'' remains open even under the standard setting of covariate shift. This paper addresses this fundamental question by proving that, surprisingly, classical Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) purely using source data (without any modification) achieves the minimax optimality for covariate shift under the well-specified setting. That is, no algorithm performs better than MLE in this setting (up to a constant factor), justifying MLE is all you need.},

  abstract = {The paper addresses the challenge that while Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded multimodal potential toward General Artificial Intelligence (AGI), current multimodal LLMs still fall short in effectively unifying comprehension and generation tasks, let alone open-world emergent abilities. The authors contend that the key to overcoming this limitation lies in enabling text and images to be represented and processed interchangeably within a unified autoregressive Transformer. They introduce SEED, an elaborate image tokenizer that empowers LLMs with the ability to SEE and Draw at the same time. The tokenizer is designed with two crucial principles: (1) Image tokens should be independent of 2D physical patch positions and be produced with a 1D causal dependency, aligning with the left-to-right autoregressive prediction mechanism in LLMs; (2) Image tokens should capture high-level semantics consistent with the degree of semantic abstraction in words, optimized for both discriminativeness and reconstruction. With SEED tokens, LLM performs scalable multimodal autoregression under its original training recipe (next-word prediction). SEED-LLaMA is produced by large-scale pretraining and instruction tuning on interleaved textual and visual data, demonstrating impressive performance on a broad range of multimodal tasks and exhibiting compositional emergent abilities such as multi-turn in-context multimodal generation.},

  abstract = {Unsupervised methods for dimensionality reduction of neural activity and behavior have provided unprecedented insights into the underpinnings of neural information processing. One popular approach involves the recurrent switching linear dynamical system (rSLDS) model, which describes the latent dynamics of neural spike train data using discrete switches between a finite number of low-dimensional linear dynamical systems. However, a few properties of rSLDS model limit its deployability on trial varying data, such as a fixed number of states over trials, and no latent structure nor organization of states. Here we overcome these limitations by endowing the rSLDS model with a semi-Markov discrete state process, with latent geometry, that captures key properties of stochastic processes over partitions with flexible state cardinality. We leverage partial differential equations (PDE) theory to derive an efficient, semi-parametric formulation for dynamical sufficient statistics to the discrete states. This process, combined with switching dynamics, defines our infinite recurrent switching linear dynamical system (irSLDS) model class. We first validate and demonstrate the capabilities of our model on synthetic data. Next, we turn to the analysis of mice electrophysiological data during decision-making, and uncover strong non-stationary processes underlying both within-trial and trial-averaged neural activity.},

To this end, we propose motion guidance, a zero-shot technique that allows a user to specify dense, complex motion fields that indicate where each pixel in an image should move. Motion guidance works by steering the diffusion sampling process with the gradients through an off-the-shelf optical flow network. Specifically, we design a guidance loss that encourages the sample to have the desired motion, as estimated by a flow network, while also being visually similar to the source image. By simultaneously sampling from a diffusion model and guiding the sample to minimize guidance loss, motion-edited images can be obtained.},

HUBL modifies the Bellman operators used in these algorithms, partially replacing the bootstrapped values with heuristic ones that are estimated with Monte-Carlo returns. For trajectories with higher returns, HUBL relies more on the heuristic values and less on bootstrapping; otherwise, it leans more heavily on bootstrapping. HUBL is very easy to combine with many existing offline RL implementations by relabeling the offline datasets with adjusted rewards and discount factors. We derive a theory that explains HUBL's effect on offline RL as reducing offline RL's complexity and thus increasing its finite-sample performance. We demonstrate that HUBL consistently improves the policy quality of four state-of-the-art bootstrapping-based offline RL algorithms (ATAC, CQL, TD3+BC, and IQL), by 9\% on average over 27 datasets of the D4RL and Meta-World benchmarks.},

Specifically, given a source video and a target text-prompt, our method generates a high-quality video that adheres to the target text, while preserving the spatial layout and motion of the input video. Our method is based on a key observation that consistency in the edited video can be obtained by enforcing consistency in the diffusion feature space. We achieve this by explicitly propagating diffusion features based on inter-frame correspondences, readily available in the model. Thus, our framework does not require any training or fine-tuning, and can work in conjunction with any off-the-shelf text-to-image editing method.

We focus on model-based approaches where a model is trained on a training set of protein sequences and fitness values to propose candidates for exploration. Two key challenges are identified: the sparsity of high-fitness samples in training sets, and a less recognized problem of ''separation'' in the design space where the desired optimum is in a region poorly represented in training data and relatively far from highly represented low-fitness regions. We show that this separation problem is a significant bottleneck in existing model-based optimization tools and propose a new approach using a novel VAE as its search model to overcome this problem. The proposed method demonstrates advantages over prior methods in robustly finding improved samples, regardless of imbalance and separation between low- and high-fitness training samples. The approach is evaluated through comprehensive benchmarks on real and semi-synthetic protein datasets as well as solution design for physics-informed neural networks, showcasing its generality in both discrete and continuous design spaces.},

Research has shown the superiority of perceptual metrics over pixel-wise metrics in aligning with human perception and serving as a proxy for the human visual system. On the other hand, as perceptual metrics rely on neural networks, there is a growing concern regarding their resilience, given the established vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial attacks. It is indeed logical to infer that perceptual metrics may inherit both the strengths and shortcomings of neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate the vulnerability of state-of-the-art perceptual similarity metrics based on an ensemble of ViT-based feature extractors to adversarial attacks. We then propose a framework to train a robust perceptual similarity metric called LipSim (Lipschitz Similarity Metric) with provable guarantees. By leveraging 1-Lipschitz neural networks as the backbone, LipSim provides guarded areas around each data point and certificates for all perturbations within an ℓ₂ ball. Finally, a comprehensive set of experiments shows the performance of LipSim in terms of natural and certified scores and on the image retrieval application.},

  abstract = {Label differentially private (label DP) algorithms seek to preserve the privacy of the labels in a training dataset in settings where the features are known to the adversary. In this work, we study a new family of label DP training algorithms. Unlike most prior label DP algorithms that have been based on label randomization, our algorithm naturally leverages the power of the central model of DP. It interleaves gradient projection operations with private stochastic gradient descent steps in order to improve the utility of the trained model while guaranteeing the privacy of the labels. We show that such projection-based algorithms can be made practical and that they improve on the state-of-the art for label DP training in the high-privacy regime. We complement our empirical evaluation with theoretical results shedding light on the efficacy of our method through the lens of bias-variance trade-offs.},

  abstract = {A fundamental characteristic of audio is its compositional nature. Audio-language models (ALMs) trained using a contrastive approach (e.g., CLAP) that learns a shared representation between audio and language modalities have improved performance in many downstream applications, including zero-shot audio classification, audio retrieval, etc. However, the ability of these models to effectively perform compositional reasoning remains largely unexplored and necessitates additional research. In this paper, we propose CompA, a collection of two expert-annotated benchmarks with a majority of real-world audio samples, to evaluate compositional reasoning in ALMs. Our proposed CompA-order evaluates how well an ALM understands the order or occurrence of acoustic events in audio, and CompA-attribute evaluates attribute-binding of acoustic events. An instance from either benchmark consists of two audio-caption pairs, where both audios have the same acoustic events but with different compositions. An ALM is evaluated on how well it matches the right audio to the right caption. Using this benchmark, we first show that current ALMs perform only marginally better than random chance, thereby struggling with compositional reasoning. Next, we propose CompA-CLAP, where we fine-tune CLAP using a novel learning method to improve its compositional reasoning abilities.},

  abstract = {Some reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have the capability of recombining together pieces of previously seen experience to solve a task never seen before during training. This oft-sought property is one of the few ways in which dynamic programming based RL algorithms are considered different from supervised learning (SL) based RL algorithms. Yet, recent RL methods based on off-the-shelf SL algorithms achieve excellent results without an explicit mechanism for stitching; it remains unclear whether those methods forgo this important stitching property. This paper studies this question in the setting of goal-reaching problems. We show that the desirable stitching property corresponds to a form of generalization: after training on a distribution of (state, goal) pairs, one would like to evaluate on (state, goal) pairs not seen together in the training data. Our analysis shows that this sort of generalization is different from i.i.d. generalization. This connection between stitching and generalization reveals why we should not expect existing RL methods based on SL to perform stitching, even in the limit of large datasets and models. We experimentally validate this result on carefully constructed datasets. This connection suggests a simple remedy, the same remedy for improving generalization in supervised learning: data augmentation. We propose a naive temporal data augmentation approach and demonstrate that adding it to RL methods based on SL enables them to successfully stitch together experience, so that they succeed in navigating between states and goals unseen together during training.},

By addressing the limitations of existing Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks and proposing innovative evaluation methodologies, our research seeks to advance our understanding of these models' capabilities. We propose a novel VQA benchmark based on well-known visual classification datasets which allows a granular evaluation of text-generative vision-language models and their comparison with discriminative vision-language models. To improve the assessment of coarse answers on fine-grained classification tasks, we suggest using the semantic hierarchy of the label space to ask automatically generated follow-up questions about the ground-truth category. Finally, we compare traditional NLP and LLM-based metrics for the problem of evaluating model predictions given ground-truth answers. We perform a human evaluation study upon which we base our decision on the final metric. We apply our benchmark to a suite of vision-language models and show a detailed comparison of their abilities on object, action, and attribute classification.

We prove that with data drawn from the $d$-dimensional Boolean hypercube labeled by the quadratic ``XOR'' function $y = -x_ix_j$, it is possible to train to a population error $o(1)$ with $d \:\text{polylog}(d)$ samples. Our result considers simultaneously training both layers of the two-layer-neural network with ReLU activations via standard minibatch SGD on the logistic loss. To our knowledge, this work is the first to give a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(d)$ for efficiently learning the XOR function on isotropic data on a standard neural network with standard training. Our main technique is showing that the network evolves in two phases: a \textit{signal-finding} phase where the network is small and many of the neurons evolve independently to find features, and a \textit{signal-heavy} phase, where SGD maintains and balances the features. We leverage the simultaneous training of the layers to show that it is sufficient for only a small fraction of the neurons to learn features, since those neurons will be amplified by the simultaneous growth of their second layer weights.},

However, the dominant paradigm for training Preference Models (PMs) for that purpose suffers from fundamental limitations, such as lack of transparency and scalability, along with susceptibility to overfitting the preference dataset. We propose Compositional Preference Models (CPMs), a novel PM framework that decomposes one global preference assessment into several interpretable features, obtains scalar scores for these features from a prompted LM, and aggregates these scores using a logistic regression classifier. Through these simple steps, CPMs allow to control which properties of the preference data are used to train the preference model and to build it based on features that are believed to underlie the human preference judgment. Our experiments show that CPMs not only improve generalization and are more robust to overoptimization than standard PMs, but also that best-of-n samples obtained using CPMs tend to be preferred over samples obtained using conventional PMs. Overall, our approach demonstrates the benefits of endowing PMs with priors about which features determine human preferences while relying on LM capabilities to extract those features in a scalable and robust way.},

  abstract = {Data contamination, i.e., the presence of test data from downstream tasks in the training data of large language models (LLMs), is a potential major issue in measuring LLMs' real effectiveness on other tasks. We propose a straightforward yet effective method for identifying data contamination within LLMs. At its core, our approach starts by identifying potential contamination at the instance level; using this information, our approach then assesses wider contamination at the partition level. To estimate contamination of individual instances, we employ 'guided instruction:' a prompt consisting of the dataset name, partition type, and the random-length initial segment of a reference instance, asking the LLM to complete it. An instance is flagged as contaminated if the LLM's output either exactly or nearly matches the latter segment of the reference. To understand if an entire partition is contaminated, we propose two ideas. The first idea marks a dataset partition as contaminated if the average overlap score with the reference instances (as measured by ROUGE-L or BLEURT) is statistically significantly better with the completions from guided instruction compared to a 'general instruction' that does not include the dataset and partition name. The second idea marks a dataset partition as contaminated if a classifier based on GPT-4 with few-shot in-context learning prompt marks multiple generated completions as exact/near-exact matches of the corresponding reference instances. Our best method achieves an accuracy between 92% and 100% in detecting if an LLM is contaminated with seven datasets, containing train and test/validation partitions, when contrasted with manual evaluation by human experts. Further, our findings indicate that GPT-4 is contaminated with AG News, WNLI, and XSum datasets.},

Previous works have analyzed separately how forgetting is affected by either task similarity or overparameterization. In contrast, our paper examines how task similarity and overparameterization jointly affect forgetting in an analyzable model. Specifically, we focus on two-task continual linear regression, where the second task is a random orthogonal transformation of an arbitrary first task (an abstraction of random permutation tasks). We derive an exact analytical expression for the expected forgetting — and uncover a nuanced pattern. In highly overparameterized models, intermediate task similarity causes the most forgetting. However, near the interpolation threshold, forgetting decreases monotonically with the expected task similarity. We validate our findings with linear regression on synthetic data, and with neural networks on established permutation task benchmarks.},

@inproceedings{gollakota2024efficient,
  abstract = {We give the first efficient algorithm for learning halfspaces in the testable learning model recently defined by Rubinfeld and Vasilyan [2022]. In this model, a learner certifies that the accuracy of its output hypothesis is near optimal whenever the training set passes an associated test, and training sets drawn from some target distribution must pass the test. This model is more challenging than distribution-specific agnostic or Massart noise models where the learner is allowed to fail arbitrarily if the distributional assumption does not hold. We consider the setting where the target distribution is the standard Gaussian in $d$ dimensions and the label noise is either Massart or adversarial (agnostic). For Massart noise, our tester-learner runs in polynomial time and outputs a hypothesis with (information-theoretically optimal) error $\mathrm{opt}+\epsilon$ (and extends to any fixed strongly log-concave target distribution). For adversarial noise, our tester-learner obtains error $O(\mathrm{opt})+\epsilon$ in polynomial time. Prior work on testable learning ignores the labels in the training set and checks that the empirical moments of the covariates are close to the moments of the base distribution. Here we develop new tests of independent interest that make critical use of the labels and combine them with the moment-matching approach of Gollakota et al. [2022]. This enables us to implement a testable variant of the algorithm of Diakonikolas et al. [2020a, 2020b] for learning noisy halfspaces using nonconvex SGD.},

The _Laplacian representation_ is a promising approach to address these problems by inducing informative state encoding and intrinsic rewards for temporally-extended action discovery and reward shaping. To obtain the Laplacian representation one needs to compute the eigensystem of the graph Laplacian, which is often approximated through optimization objectives compatible with deep learning approaches. These approximations, however, depend on hyperparameters that are impossible to tune efficiently, converge to arbitrary rotations of the desired eigenvectors, and are unable to accurately recover the corresponding eigenvalues. In this paper we introduce a theoretically sound objective and corresponding optimization algorithm for approximating the Laplacian representation. Our approach naturally recovers both the true eigenvectors and eigenvalues while eliminating the hyperparameter dependence of previous approximations. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method and we show that those results translate empirically into robust learning across multiple environments.},

  abstract = {Characterizing the relationship between neural population activity and behavioral data is a central goal of neuroscience. While latent variable models (LVMs) are successful in describing high-dimensional data, they are typically only designed for a single type of data, making it difficult to identify structure shared across different experimental data modalities. Here, we address this shortcoming by proposing an unsupervised LVM which extracts shared and independent latents for distinct, simultaneously recorded experimental modalities. We do this by combining Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA), an interpretable LVM for neural spiking data with temporally smooth latent space, with Gaussian Process Variational Autoencoders (GP-VAEs), which similarly use a GP prior to characterize correlations in a latent space, but admit rich expressivity due to a deep neural network mapping to observations. We achieve interpretability in our model by partitioning latent variability into components that are either shared between or independent to each modality. We parameterize the latents of our model in the Fourier domain, and show improved latent identification using this approach over standard GP-VAE methods. We validate our model on simulated multi-modal data consisting of Poisson spike counts and MNIST images that scale and rotate smoothly over time. We show that the multi-modal GP-VAE (MM-GPVAE) is able to not only identify the shared and independent latent structure across modalities accurately, but provides good reconstructions of both images and neural rates on held-out trials. Finally, we demonstrate our framework on two real world multi-modal experimental settings: Drosophila whole-brain calcium imaging alongside tracked limb positions, and Manduca sexta spike train measurements from ten wing muscles as the animal tracks a visual stimulus.},

However, despite the recent efforts, the non-DL algorithms based on gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) remain a strong go-to solution for these problems. One of the research directions aimed at improving the position of tabular DL involves designing so-called retrieval-augmented models. For a target object, such models retrieve other objects (e.g. the nearest neighbors) from the available training data and use their features and labels to make a better prediction. In this work, we present TabR -- essentially, a feed-forward network with a custom k-Nearest-Neighbors-like component in the middle. On a set of public benchmarks with datasets up to several million objects, TabR marks a big step forward for tabular DL: it demonstrates the best average performance among tabular DL models, becomes the new state-of-the-art on several datasets, and even outperforms GBDT models on the recently proposed "GBDT-friendly" benchmark (see Figure 1). Among the important findings and technical details powering TabR, the main ones lie in the attention-like mechanism that is responsible for retrieving the nearest neighbors and extracting valuable signal from them. In addition to the higher performance, TabR is simple and significantly more efficient compared to prior retrieval-based tabular DL models.},

@inproceedings{gou2024critic,
  abstract = {Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have been impressive. However, these models sometimes show inconsistencies and problematic behavior, such as hallucinating facts, generating flawed code, or creating offensive and toxic content. Unlike these models, humans typically utilize external tools to cross-check and refine their initial content, like using a search engine for fact-checking, or a code interpreter for debugging. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a framework called CRITIC that allows LLMs, which are essentially "black boxes" to validate and progressively amend their own outputs in a manner similar to human interaction with tools. More specifically, starting with an initial output, CRITIC interacts with appropriate tools to evaluate certain aspects of the text, and then revises the output based on the feedback obtained during this validation process. Comprehensive evaluations involving free-form question answering, mathematical program synthesis, and toxicity reduction demonstrate that CRITIC consistently enhances the performance of LLMs. Meanwhile, our research highlights the crucial importance of external feedback in promoting the ongoing self-improvement of LLMs.},

In this paper, we propose ToRA a series of Tool-integrated Reasoning Agents designed to solve challenging mathematical problems by seamlessly integrating natural language reasoning with the utilization of external tools (e.g., computation libraries and symbolic solvers), thereby amalgamating the analytical prowess of language and the computational efficiency of tools. To train ToRA, we curate interactive tool-use trajectories on mathematical datasets, apply imitation learning on the annotations, and propose output space shaping to further refine models' reasoning behavior. As a result, ToRA models significantly outperform open-source models on 10 mathematical reasoning datasets across all scales with 13%-19% absolute improvements on average. Notably, ToRA-7B reaches 44.6% on the competition-level dataset MATH, surpassing the best open-source model WizardMath-70B by 22% absolute. ToRA-34B is also the first open-source model that achieves an accuracy exceeding 50% on MATH, which significantly outperforms GPT-4's CoT result, and is competitive with GPT-4 solving problems with programs. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the benefits and remaining challenges of tool interaction for mathematical reasoning, providing valuable insights for future research.},

  abstract = {In this work we describe successor heads: attention heads that increment tokens with a natural ordering, such as numbers, months, and days. For example, successor heads increment 'Monday' into 'Tuesday'. We explain the successor head behavior with an approach rooted in mechanistic interpretability, the field that aims to explain how models complete tasks in human-understandable terms. Existing research in this area has struggled to find recurring, mechanistically interpretable large language model (LLM) components beyond small toy models. Further, existing results have led to very little insight to explain the internals of the larger models that are used in practice. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of successor heads in LLMs and find that they implement abstract representations that are common to different architectures. Successor heads form in LLMs with as few as 31 million parameters, and at least as many as 12 billion parameters, such as GPT-2, Pythia, and Llama-2. We find a set of 'mod 10' features that underlie how successor heads increment in LLMs across different architectures and sizes. We perform vector arithmetic with these features to edit head behavior and provide insights into numeric representations within LLMs. Additionally, we study the behavior of successor heads on natural language data, where we find that successor heads are important for achieving a low loss on examples involving succession, and also identify interpretable polysemanticity in a Pythia successor head.},

  abstract = {Generalization remains one of the most important desiderata for robust robot learning systems. While recently proposed approaches show promise in generalization to novel objects, semantic concepts, or visual distribution shifts, generalization to new tasks remains challenging. For example, a language-conditioned policy trained on pick-and-place tasks will not be able to generalize to a folding task, even if the arm trajectory of folding is similar to pick-and-place. Our key insight is that this kind of generalization becomes feasible if we represent the task through rough trajectory sketches. We propose a policy conditioning method using such rough trajectory sketches, which we call {RT}-Trajectory, that is practical, easy to specify, and allows the policy to effectively perform new tasks that would otherwise be challenging to perform. We find that trajectory sketches strike a balance between being detailed enough to express low-level motion-centric guidance while being coarse enough to allow the learned policy to interpret the trajectory sketch in the context of situational visual observations. In addition, we show how trajectory sketches can provide a useful interface to communicate with robotic policies -- they can be specified through simple human inputs like drawings or videos, or through automated methods such as modern image-generating or waypoint-generating methods. We evaluate {RT}-Trajectory at scale on a variety of real-world robotic tasks, and find that {RT}-Trajectory is able to perform a wider range of tasks compared to language-conditioned and goal-conditioned policies, when provided the same training data.},

@inproceedings{gu2024quadratic,
  abstract = {In distributed deep learning with data parallelism, synchronizing gradients at each training step can cause a huge communication overhead, especially when many nodes work together to train large models. Local gradient methods, such as Local {SGD}, address this issue by allowing workers to compute locally for H steps without synchronizing with others, hence reducing communication frequency. While H has been viewed as a hyperparameter to trade optimization efficiency for communication cost, recent research indicates that setting a proper H value can lead to generalization improvement. Yet, selecting a proper H is elusive. This work proposes a theory-grounded method for determining H, named the Quadratic Synchronization Rule ({QSR}), which recommends dynamically setting H in proportion to 1/η² as the learning rate η decays over time. Extensive {ImageNet} experiments on {ResNet} and {ViT} show that local gradient methods with {QSR} consistently improve the test accuracy over other synchronization strategies. Compared to the standard data parallel training, {QSR} enables Local {AdamW} to cut the training time on 16 or 64 {GPUs} down from 26.7 to 20.2 hours or from 8.6 to 5.5 hours and, at the same time, achieves 1.16\% or 0.84\% higher top-1 validation accuracy.},

Existing watermarking strategies operate by altering the decoder of an existing language model. In this paper, we ask whether language models can directly learn to generate watermarked text, which would have significant implications for the real-world deployment of watermarks. First, learned watermarks could be used to build open models that naturally generate watermarked text, enabling watermarking for open models, where users can control the decoding procedure. Second, if watermarking is used to determine the provenance of generated text, an adversary can hurt the reputation of a victim model by spoofing its watermark and generating damaging watermarked text. We explore watermark distillation, which trains a student model to behave like a teacher model that uses decoding-based watermarking. We test our approach on three distinct decoding-based watermarking strategies and various hyperparameter settings, finding that models can learn to generate watermarked text with high detectability. However, we also identify limitations to learnability, including the loss of watermarking capabilities under fine-tuning on normal text and high sample complexity when learning low-distortion watermarks.},

We propose a diffusion process that denoises inputs at multiple resolutions jointly and uses a {NestedUNet} architecture where features and parameters for small-scale inputs are nested within those of large scales. In addition, {MDM} enables a progressive training schedule from lower to higher resolutions, which leads to significant improvements in optimization for high-resolution generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of {MDM} by training a single pixel-space model up to 1024×1024 resolution on the CC12M dataset and showing strong zero-shot generalization across class-conditioned image generation, high-resolution text-to-image synthesis, and text-to-video generation applications.},

  abstract = {Double descent presents a counter-intuitive aspect within the machine learning domain, where test performance initially decreases and then increases again as model complexity grows. While some theoretical explanations have been proposed for this phenomenon in specific contexts, an accepted theory to account for its occurrence in deep learning remains yet to be established. In this study, we revisit the phenomenon of double descent and demonstrate that the presence of noisy data strongly influences its occurrence. Through conducting a comprehensive analysis of the feature space of learned representations, we unveil that double descent arises in imperfect models trained with noisy data. We argue that double descent is a consequence of the model first learning the noisy data until interpolation and then adding implicit regularization via over-parameterization, thus acquiring the capability to separate the information from the noise. We demonstrate that while small and intermediate models before the interpolation threshold follow the traditional bias-variance trade-off, over-parameterized models interpolate noisy samples among robust data, thus acquiring the capability to separate the information from the noise.},

  abstract = {Online-Within-Online ({OWO}) meta learning stands for the online multi-task learning paradigm in which both tasks and data within each task become available in a sequential order. In this work, we study the {OWO} meta learning of the initialization and step size of within-task online algorithms in the non-convex setting, and provide improved regret bounds under mild assumptions of loss functions. Previous work analyzing this scenario has obtained for bounded and piecewise Lipschitz functions an averaged regret bound O((√m/T^{1/4} + (log m)log T/√T + V)√m) across T tasks, with m iterations per task and V the task similarity. Our first contribution is to modify the existing non-convex {OWO} meta learning algorithm and improve the regret bound to O((1/T^{1/2-α} + (log T)^{9/2}/T + V)√m), for any α ∈ (0,1/2). Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm with regret O((log T/T + V)√m) for non-convex {OWO} meta learning. This regret bound exhibits better asymptotic performance than previous ones, and holds for any bounded loss functions. Additionally, we provide a novel PAC-Bayes bound for multi-task learning via regret analysis, investigating how to attain generalization bounds for statistical meta learning through regret analysis.},

Previous studies either considered the global regret with full information about the objective functions, or studied the local regret with window-smoothed objective functions, which required access to unlimited number of gradient oracles per time step. In this paper, we focus on the more challenging and practical setting, where access to only a single oracle is allowed per time step, and take the local regret of the original (i.e., unsmoothed) objective functions as the performance metric. For both settings respectively with a single exact and stochastic gradient oracle feedback, we derive lower bounds on the local regret and show that the classical online (stochastic) gradient descent algorithms are optimal. For the more challenging setting with a single function value oracle feedback, we develop an online algorithm based on a one-point running difference gradient estimator, and show that such an algorithm achieves a local regret that matches what a generic stochastic gradient oracle can achieve.},

  abstract = {An emerging method to cheaply improve a weaker language model is to finetune it on outputs from a stronger model, such as a proprietary system like {ChatGPT} (e.g., Alpaca, Self-Instruct, and others). This approach looks to cheaply imitate the proprietary model's capabilities using a weaker open-source model. In this work, we critically analyze this approach. We first finetune a series of {LMs} that imitate {ChatGPT} using varying base model sizes (1.5B--13B), data sources, and imitation data amounts (0.3M--150M tokens). We then evaluate the models using crowd raters and canonical {NLP} benchmarks. Initially, we were surprised by the output quality of our imitation models -- they appear far better at following instructions, and crowd workers rate their outputs as competitive with {ChatGPT}. However, when conducting more targeted automatic evaluations, we find that imitation models close little to none of the gap from the base {LM} to {ChatGPT} on tasks that are not heavily supported in the imitation data. We show that these models learn to imitate {ChatGPT}'s style, but not its factual knowledge. We conclude that model imitation is a false promise: there exists a substantial capabilities gap between open and closed {LMs} that can be bridged using an unwieldy amount of imitation data or by using more capable base {LMs}.},

Some of the issues can be addressed by estimating a distribution over the output, but in reality, such approaches can be sensitive to estimation error and yield unstable intervals. Here, we circumvent the challenges by converting regression to a classification problem and then use CP for classification to obtain CP sets for regression. To preserve the ordering of the continuous-output space, we design a new loss function and present necessary modifications to the CP classification techniques.

  abstract = {The ultimate goal of Dataset Distillation is to synthesize a small synthetic dataset such that a model trained on this synthetic set will perform equally well as a model trained on the full, real dataset. Until now, no method of Dataset Distillation has reached this completely lossless goal, in part due to the fact that previous methods only remain effective when the total number of synthetic samples is extremely small. Since only so much information can be contained in such a small number of samples, it seems that to achieve truly lossless dataset distillation, we must develop a distillation method that remains effective as the size of the synthetic dataset grows. We present such an algorithm and elucidate why existing methods fail to generate larger, high-quality synthetic sets. The key insight is that the training stage of the trajectories we choose to match (i.e., early or late) greatly affects the effectiveness of the distilled dataset. We propose to align the difficulty of the generated patterns with the size of the synthetic dataset, successfully scaling trajectory matching-based methods to larger synthetic datasets and achieving lossless dataset distillation for the very first time.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various tasks, but they rely on carefully crafted prompts that often demand substantial human effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel framework for discrete prompt optimization, called EvoPrompt, which borrows the idea of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as they exhibit good performance and fast convergence. To enable EAs to work on discrete prompts, which are natural language expressions that need to be coherent and human-readable, we connect LLMs with EAs. This approach allows us to simultaneously leverage the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs and the efficient optimization performance of EAs. Specifically, abstaining from any gradients or parameters, EvoPrompt starts from a population of prompts and iteratively generates new prompts with LLMs based on evolutionary operators, improving the population based on the development set. We optimize prompts for both closed- and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5 and Alpaca, on 31 datasets covering language understanding, generation tasks, as well as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) tasks. EvoPrompt significantly outperforms human-engineered prompts and existing methods for automatic prompt generation.},

We establish sample-efficient learning for two new POMDP subclasses: multi-observation revealing POMDPs and distinguishable POMDPs. Both subclasses generalize and substantially relax revealing POMDPs—a widely studied subclass for sample-efficient learning.

Unlike existing works that operate directly in pose space, we leverage the latent space of pretrained autoencoders as a more expressive and robust representation for motion extraction and infusion. We present a novel generative model that produces diverse stylization results of a single motion (latent) code. During training, a motion code is decomposed into two coding components: a deterministic content code, and a probabilistic style code adhering to a prior distribution; then a generator massages the random combination of content and style codes to reconstruct the corresponding motion codes. In inference, users can opt to stylize a motion using style cues from a reference motion or a label. Even in the absence of explicit style input, our model facilitates novel re-stylization by sampling from the unconditional style prior distribution. Experimental results show that our proposed stylization models, despite their lightweight design, outperform the state-of-the-arts in style reenactment, content preservation, and generalization across various applications and settings.},

In this work, we start from approximating the interaction between samples, i.e. how learning one sample would modify the model's prediction on other samples. Through analysing the terms involved in weight updates in supervised learning, we find that labels influence the interaction between samples. Therefore, we propose the labelled pseudo Neural Tangent Kernel ({lpNTK}) which takes label information into consideration when measuring the interactions between samples. We first prove that {lpNTK} asymptotically converges to the empirical neural tangent kernel in terms of the Frobenius norm under certain assumptions. Secondly, we illustrate how {lpNTK} helps to understand learning phenomena identified in previous work, specifically the learning difficulty of samples and forgetting events during learning. Moreover, we also show that using {lpNTK} to identify and remove poisoning training samples does not hurt the generalisation performance of {ANNs}.},

Here, we propose Beam Enumeration to exhaustively enumerate the most probable sub-sequences from language-based molecular generative models and show that molecular substructures can be extracted. When coupled with reinforcement learning, extracted substructures become meaningful, providing a source of explainability and improving sample efficiency through self-conditioned generation. Beam Enumeration is generally applicable to any language-based molecular generative model and notably further improves the performance of the recently reported Augmented Memory algorithm, which achieved the new state-of-the-art on the Practical Molecular Optimization benchmark for sample efficiency. The combined algorithm generates more high reward molecules and faster, given a fixed oracle budget.

In machine learning, this ability is known as \emph{strong} or \emph{out-of-distribution} generalization. However, merely considering differences in distributions is inadequate for fully capturing differences between learning environments. In the present paper, we investigate \emph{out-of-variable} generalization, which pertains to an agent's generalization capabilities concerning environments with variables that were never jointly observed before. This skill closely reflects the process of animate learning: we, too, explore Nature by probing, observing, and measuring proper \emph{subsets} of variables at any given time. Mathematically, \emph{oov} generalization requires the efficient re-use of past marginal information, i.e., information over subsets of previously observed variables. We study this problem, focusing on prediction tasks across environments that contain overlapping, yet distinct, sets of causes. We show that after fitting a classifier, the residual distribution in one environment reveals the partial derivative of the true generating function with respect to the unobserved causal parent in that environment. We leverage this information and propose a method that exhibits non-trivial out-of-variable generalization performance when facing an overlapping, yet distinct, set of causal predictors.},

Despite the effectiveness of {RLHF}, it is intricate to implement and train, thus recent studies explore how to develop alternative alignment approaches based on supervised fine-tuning ({SFT}). A major limitation of {SFT} is that it essentially does imitation learning, which can't fully understand what are the expected behaviors. To address this issue, we propose an improved alignment approach named {FIGA}. Different from prior methods, we incorporate fine-grained (i.e., token or phrase level) quality signals that are derived by contrasting good and bad responses. Our approach has made two major contributions. Firstly, we curate a refined alignment dataset that pairs initial responses and the corresponding revised ones. Secondly, we devise a new loss function can leverage fine-grained quality signals to instruct the learning of {LLMs} for alignment.

@inproceedings{gupta2024structuring,
  abstract = {Self-supervised learning converts raw perceptual data such as images to a compact space where simple Euclidean distances measure meaningful variations in data. In this paper, we extend this formulation by adding additional geometric structure to the embedding space by enforcing transformations of input space to correspond to simple (i.e., linear) transformations of embedding space. Specifically, in the contrastive learning setting, we introduce an equivariance objective and theoretically prove that its minima force augmentations on input space to correspond to rotations on the spherical embedding space. We show that merely combining our equivariant loss with a non-collapse term results in non-trivial representations, without requiring invariance to data augmentations. Optimal performance is achieved by also encouraging approximate invariance, where input augmentations correspond to small rotations. Our method, {CARE}: Contrastive Augmentation-induced Rotational Equivariance, leads to improved performance on downstream tasks and ensures sensitivity in embedding space to important variations in data (e.g., color) that standard contrastive methods do not achieve.

@inproceedings{gupta2024dualencoders,
  abstract = {Dual-encoder ({DE}) models are widely used in retrieval tasks, most commonly studied on open {QA} benchmarks that are often characterized by multi-class and limited training data. In contrast, their performance in multi-label and data-rich retrieval settings like extreme multi-label classification ({XMC}), remains under-explored. Current empirical evidence indicates that {DE} models fall significantly short on {XMC} benchmarks, where {SOTA} methods linearly scale the number of learnable parameters with the total number of classes (documents in the corpus) by employing per-class classification head. To this end, we first study and highlight that existing multi-label contrastive training losses are not appropriate for training {DE} models on {XMC} tasks. We propose decoupled softmax loss - a simple modification to the {InfoNCE} loss - that overcomes the limitations of existing contrastive losses. We further extend our loss design to a soft top-k operator-based loss which is tailored to optimize top-k prediction performance. When trained with our proposed loss functions, standard {DE} models alone can match or outperform {SOTA} methods by up to 2\% at Precision@1 even on the largest {XMC} datasets while being 20x smaller in terms of the number of trainable parameters. This leads to more parameter-efficient and universally applicable solutions for retrieval tasks.},

Unfortunately, a hard lesson so far is that no proposal convincingly outperforms a simple empirical risk minimization baseline. On the other hand, large language models ({LLMs}) have erupted as algorithms able to learn in-context, generalizing on-the-fly to the eclectic contextual circumstances. We argue that context is environment, and posit that in-context learning holds the key to better domain generalization. Via extensive theory and experiments, we show that paying attention to context---unlabeled examples as they arrive---allows our proposed In-Context Risk Minimization ({ICRM}) algorithm to zoom-in on the test environment risk minimizer, leading to significant {OOD} performance improvements.},

@inproceedings{gupta2024mirage,
  abstract = {{GNNs}, like other deep learning models, are data and computation hungry. There is a pressing need to scale training of {GNNs} on large datasets to enable their usage on low-resource environments. Graph distillation is an effort in that direction with the aim to construct a smaller synthetic training set from the original training data without significantly compromising model performance. While initial efforts are promising, this work is motivated by two key observations: (1) Existing graph distillation algorithms themselves rely on training with the full dataset, which undermines the very premise of graph distillation. (2) The distillation process is specific to the target {GNN} architecture and hyper-parameters and thus not robust to changes in the modeling pipeline. We circumvent these limitations by designing a distillation algorithm called Mirage for graph classification. Mirage is built on the insight that a message-passing {GNN} decomposes the input graph into a multiset of computation trees. Furthermore, the frequency distribution of computation trees is often skewed in nature, enabling us to condense this data into a concise distilled summary. By compressing the computation data itself, as opposed to emulating gradient flows on the original training set---a prevalent approach to date---Mirage transforms into an unsupervised and architecture-agnostic distillation algorithm. Extensive benchmarking on real-world datasets underscores Mirage's superiority, showcasing enhanced generalization accuracy, data compression, and distillation efficiency when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in language models ({LMs}) have led to significant improvements in quality on complex {NLP} tasks, but at the expense of increased inference costs. A simple strategy to achieve more favorable cost-quality tradeoffs is cascading: here, a small model is invoked for most ``easy'' instances, while a few ``hard'' instances are deferred to the large model. While the principles underpinning effective cascading are well-studied for classification tasks --- with deferral based on predicted class uncertainty favored theoretically and practically --- a similar understanding is lacking for generative {LM} tasks. In this work, we initiate a systematic study of deferral rules for {LM} cascades. We begin by examining the natural extension of predicted class uncertainty to generative {LM} tasks, namely, the predicted sequence uncertainty. We show that this measure suffers from the length bias problem, either over- or under-emphasizing outputs based on their lengths. We propose token-level deferral rules to mitigate this issue, and further extend our approach to take into account cascading beyond two models. Experiments across four tasks --- translation, summarization, question answering, and math word problems --- and model families ranging from {T5} to {GPT-4} demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

While this ability allows personalization of {LLMs} and enables human behavior simulation, its effect on {LLMs}' capabilities remains unclear. To fill this gap, we present the first extensive study of the unintended side-effects of persona assignment on the ability of {LLMs} to perform basic reasoning tasks. Our study covers 24 reasoning datasets, 4 {LLMs}, and 19 diverse personas (e.g. an Asian person) spanning 5 socio-demographic groups. Our experiments unveil that {LLMs} harbor deep rooted bias against various socio-demographics underneath a veneer of fairness. Specifically, we find that assigning personas from certain socio-demographic groups can systematically decrease performance on reasoning tasks, which has potential negative implications in real-world applications. We further investigate the origins of this bias and find correlations between the extent of bias and the socio-economic status of the demographic group. Our findings emphasize the urgent need to investigate and mitigate the potential negative side-effects of persona assignment in {LLMs} before their broad adoption.},

We find evidence for the latter by analyzing the learned representations of three spatial datasets (world, {US}, {NYC} places) and three temporal datasets (historical figures, artworks, news headlines) in the Llama-2 family of models. We discover that {LLMs} learn linear representations of space and time across multiple scales. These representations are robust to prompting variations and unified across different entity types (e.g. cities and landmarks). In addition, we identify individual 'space neurons' and 'time neurons' that reliably encode spatial and temporal coordinates.

The aggregation in {SNNs} is carried out during training. Since the number of simplices of various orders in a simplicial complex is significantly large, the memory and training-time requirement in {SNNs} is enormous. In this work, we propose a scalable simplicial-aware neural network ({SaNN}) model with a constant run-time and memory requirements independent of the size of the simplicial complex and the density of interactions in it. {SaNN} is based on pre-aggregated simplicial-aware features as inputs to a neural network, so it has a strong simplicial-structural inductive bias. We provide theoretical conditions under which {SaNN} is provably more powerful than the Weisfeiler-Lehman ({WL}) graph isomorphism test and as powerful as the simplicial Weisfeiler-Lehman ({SWL}) test. We also show that {SaNN} is permutation and orientation equivariant and satisfies simplicial-awareness of the highest order in a simplicial complex. We demonstrate via numerical experiments that despite being computationally economical, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting trajectories, simplicial closures, and classifying graphs.},

The intermediate feature representations obtained from {MIM} are suitable for fine-tuning on downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose an Image Modeling framework based on random orthogonal projection instead of binary masking as in {MIM}. Our proposed Random Orthogonal Projection Image Modeling ({ROPIM}) reduces spatially-wise token information under guaranteed bound on the noise variance and can be considered as masking entire spatial image area under locally varying masking degrees. Since {ROPIM} uses a random subspace for the projection that realizes the masking step, the readily available complement of the subspace can be used during unmasking to promote recovery of removed information. In this paper, we show that using random orthogonal projection leads to superior performance compared to crop-based masking. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on several popular benchmarks.},

However, imitation can also lead models to reproduce inaccuracies or harmful content if present in the context. We study harmful imitation through the lens of a model's internal representations, and identify two related phenomena: overthinking and false induction heads. The first phenomenon, overthinking, appears when we decode predictions from intermediate layers, given correct vs. incorrect few-shot demonstrations. At early layers, both demonstrations induce similar model behavior, but the behavior diverges sharply at some "critical layer", after which the accuracy given incorrect demonstrations progressively decreases. The second phenomenon, false induction heads, are a possible mechanistic cause of overthinking: these are heads in late layers that attend to and copy false information from previous demonstrations, and whose ablation reduces overthinking. Beyond scientific understanding, our results suggest that studying intermediate model computations could be a promising avenue for understanding and guarding against harmful model behaviors.},

For {AI} agents to successfully interact in these settings, however, achieving superhuman performance alone is not sufficient; they also need to account for suboptimal actions or idiosyncratic style from their less-skilled counterparts. We propose a formal evaluation framework for assessing the compatibility of near-optimal {AI} with interaction partners who may have much lower levels of skill; we use popular collaborative chess variants as model systems to study and develop {AI} agents that can successfully interact with lower-skill entities. Traditional chess engines designed to output near-optimal moves prove to be inadequate partners when paired with engines of various lower skill levels in this domain, as they are not designed to consider the presence of other agents. We contribute three methodologies to explicitly create skill-compatible {AI} agents in complex decision-making settings, and two chess game frameworks designed to foster collaboration between powerful {AI} agents and less-skilled partners. On these frameworks, our agents outperform state-of-the-art chess {AI} (based on {AlphaZero}) despite being weaker in conventional chess, demonstrating that skill-compatibility is a tangible trait that is qualitatively and measurably distinct from raw performance.

When such features are spuriously correlated with the label, this can result in suboptimal performance on minority subgroups. Despite the growing popularity of methods which learn from unlabeled data, the extent to which these representations rely on spurious features for prediction is unclear. In this work, we explore the impact of spurious features on Self-Supervised Learning ({SSL}) for visual representation learning. We first empirically show that commonly used augmentations in {SSL} can cause undesired invariances in the image space, and illustrate this with a simple example. We further show that classical approaches in combating spurious correlations, such as dataset re-sampling during {SSL}, do not consistently lead to invariant representations. Motivated by these findings, we propose {LateTVG} to remove spurious information from these representations during pretraining, by regularizing later layers of the encoder via pruning. We find that our method produces representations which outperform the baselines on several benchmarks, without the need for group or label information during {SSL}.},

There is a lack of understanding regarding the interplay between global and local fairness in {FL}, particularly under data heterogeneity, and if and when one implies the other. To address this gap, we leverage a body of work in information theory called partial information decomposition ({PID}), which first identifies three sources of unfairness in {FL}, namely, Unique Disparity, Redundant Disparity, and Masked Disparity. We demonstrate how these three disparities contribute to global and local fairness using canonical examples. This decomposition helps us derive fundamental limits on the trade-off between global and local fairness, highlighting where they agree or disagree. We introduce the Accuracy and Global-Local Fairness Optimality Problem ({AGLFOP}), a convex optimization that defines the theoretical limits of accuracy and fairness trade-offs, identifying the best possible performance any {FL} strategy can attain given a dataset and client distribution. We also present experimental results on synthetic datasets and the {ADULT} dataset to support our theoretical findings.},

  abstract = {Spiking Neural Networks ({SNNs}) are a promising research direction for building power-efficient information processing systems, especially for temporal tasks such as speech recognition. In {SNNs}, delays refer to the time needed for one spike to travel from one neuron to another. These delays matter because they influence the spike arrival times, and it is well-known that spiking neurons respond more strongly to coincident input spikes. More formally, it has been shown theoretically that plastic delays greatly increase the expressivity in {SNNs}. Yet, efficient algorithms to learn these delays have been lacking. Here, we propose a new discrete-time algorithm that addresses this issue in deep feedforward {SNNs} using backpropagation, in an offline manner. To simulate delays between consecutive layers, we use 1{D} convolutions across time. The kernels contain only a few non-zero weights -- one per synapse -- whose positions correspond to the delays. These positions are learned together with the weights using the recently proposed Dilated Convolution with Learnable Spacings ({DCLS}).},

@inproceedings{han2024hyperattention,
  abstract = {We present an approximate attention mechanism named HyperAttention to address the computational challenges posed by the growing complexity of long contexts used in Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent work suggests that in the worst-case scenario, the quadratic time is necessary unless the entries of the attention matrix are bounded or the matrix has low stable rank. We introduce two parameters which measure: (1) the max column norm in the normalized attention matrix, and (2) the ratio of row norms in the unnormalized attention matrix after detecting and removing large entries. We use these fine-grained parameters to capture the hardness of the problem. Despite previous lower bounds, we are able to achieve a linear time sampling algorithm even when the matrix has unbounded entries or a large stable rank, provided the above parameters are small. HyperAttention features a modular design that easily accommodates integration of other fast low-level implementations, particularly FlashAttention. Empirically, employing Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to identify large entries, HyperAttention outperforms existing methods, giving significant speed improvements compared to state-of-the-art solutions like FlashAttention.},

A key component of these models is to learn the score function through score matching. However, it remains unclear whether gradient-based algorithms can learn the score function with a provable accuracy. This paper establishes a mathematical framework for analyzing score estimation using neural networks trained by gradient descent, covering both the optimization and the generalization aspects of the learning procedure. We propose a parametric form to formulate the denoising score-matching problem as a regression with noisy labels. The score-matching problem introduces distinct challenges, including unbounded input, vector-valued output, and an additional time variable, preventing existing techniques from being applied directly. We show that with proper designs, the evolution of neural networks during training can be accurately modeled by a series of kernel regression tasks. We establish the first generalization error (sample complexity) bounds for learning the score function with neural networks, despite the presence of noise in the observations.},

However, the conditions favoring VPT (the "when") and the underlying rationale (the "why") remain unclear. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis across 19 distinct datasets and tasks. To understand the "when" aspect, we identify the scenarios where VPT proves favorable by two dimensions: task objectives and data distributions. We find that VPT is preferable when there is 1) a substantial disparity between the original and the downstream task objectives (e.g., transitioning from classification to counting), or 2) a similarity in data distributions between the two tasks. The results indicate VPT's success cannot be attributed solely to overfitting and optimization considerations, and provides insights into VPT's mechanisms, offering guidance for its optimal utilization.},

@inproceedings{hao2024bilevel,
  abstract = {Bilevel optimization is an important formulation for many machine learning problems. Current bilevel optimization algorithms assume that the gradient of the upper-level function is Lipschitz. However, recent studies reveal that certain neural networks such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long-short-term memory networks (LSTMs) exhibit potential unbounded smoothness, rendering conventional bilevel optimization algorithms unsuitable. In this paper, we design a new bilevel optimization algorithm, namely BO-REP (Bilevel Optimization with lower-level initialization REfinement and Periodic updates), to address this challenge. The algorithm updates the upper-level variable using normalized momentum to control the effects of stochastic gradient noise and possibly unbounded gradients. When the upper-level problem is nonconvex and unbounded smooth, and the lower-level problem is strongly convex, our algorithm requires O(1/ε^4) iterations to find an ε-stationary point in the stochastic setting. This result matches the state-of-the-art complexity results under the bounded smoothness setting up to logarithmic factors.},

  abstract = {Many recent efforts augment language models with retrieval, by adding retrieved data to the input context. For this approach to succeed, the retrieved data must be added at both training and test time. Moreover, as input length grows linearly with the size of retrieved data, cost in computation and memory grows quadratically for modern Transformers. To avoid these complications, we simply fine-tune the model on retrieved data at test time, using its standard training setup. We build a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset. For each test input, our system retrieves its neighbors and fine-tunes the model on their text. Surprisingly, retrieving and training on as few as 20 neighbors, each for only one gradient iteration, drastically improves performance across more than 20 language modeling tasks in the Pile. For example, test-time training with nearest neighbors significantly narrows the performance gap between a small {GPT}-2 and a {GPT}-{Neo} model more than 10 times larger. Sufficient index quality and size, however, are necessary. Our work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling.},

However, there is a lack of understanding as to why this method is effective for long-tailed data.

  abstract = {In the pursuit of reducing the number of trainable parameters in deep transformer networks, we employ {R}einforcement {L}earning to dynamically select layers during training and tie them together. Every few iterations, the {RL} agent is asked whether to train each layer $i$ independently or to copy the weights of a previous layer $j<i$. This facilitates weight sharing, reduces the number of trainable parameters, and also serves as an effective regularization technique. Experimental evaluations validate that our model modestly outperforms the baseline transformer model with regard to perplexity and drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters. In particular, the memory consumption during training is up to one order of magnitude less than the conventional training method.},

  abstract = {Representation rank is an important concept for understanding the role of {N}eural {N}etworks ({NN}s) in {D}eep {R}einforcement learning ({DRL}), which measures the expressive capacity of value networks. Existing studies focus on unboundedly maximizing this rank; nevertheless, that approach would introduce overly complex models in the learning, thus undermining performance. Hence, fine-tuning representation rank presents a challenging and crucial optimization problem. To address this issue, we find a guiding principle for adaptive control of the representation rank. We employ the {B}ellman equation as a theoretical foundation and derive an upper bound on the cosine similarity of consecutive state-action pairs representations of value networks. We then leverage this upper bound to propose a novel regularizer, namely {BE}llman {E}quation-based automatic rank {R}egularizer ({BEER}). This regularizer adaptively regularizes the representation rank, thus improving the {DRL} agent's performance. We first validate the effectiveness of automatic control of rank on illustrative experiments. Then, we scale up {BEER} to complex continuous control tasks by combining it with the deterministic policy gradient method. Among 12 challenging {D}eep{M}ind control tasks, {BEER} outperforms the baselines by a large margin. Besides, {BEER} demonstrates significant advantages in {Q}-value approximation.

  abstract = {Representation learning on text-attributed graphs ({TAG}s) has become a critical research problem in recent years. A typical example of a {TAG} is a paper citation graph, where the text of each paper serves as node attributes. Initial graph neural network ({GNN}) pipelines handled these text attributes by transforming them into shallow or hand-crafted features, such as skip-gram or bag-of-words features. Recent efforts have focused on enhancing these pipelines with language models ({LM}s), which typically demand intricate designs and substantial computational resources. With the advent of powerful large language models ({LLM}s) such as {GPT} or {L}lama2, which demonstrate an ability to reason and to utilize general knowledge, there is a growing need for techniques which combine the textual modelling abilities of {LLM}s with the structural learning capabilities of {GNN}s. Hence, in this work, we focus on leveraging {LLM}s to capture textual information as features, which can be used to boost {GNN} performance on downstream tasks. A key innovation is our use of explanations as features: we prompt an {LLM} to perform zero-shot classification, request textual explanations for its decision-making process, and design an {LLM}-to-{LM} interpreter to translate these explanations into informative features for downstream {GNN}s. Our experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on well-established {TAG} datasets, including {C}ora, {P}ub{M}ed, ogbn-arxiv, as well as our newly introduced dataset, tape-arxiv23. Furthermore, our method significantly speeds up training, achieving a 2.88 times improvement over the closest baseline on ogbn-arxiv. Lastly, we believe the versatility of the proposed method extends beyond {TAG}s and holds the potential to enhance other tasks involving graph-text data.},

Previous methods have relied on domain-specific heuristics such as warping-based motion representation and 3{D} {M}orphable {M}odels, which limit the naturalness and diversity of the generated avatars. In this work, we introduce {GAIA} ({G}enerative {AI} for {A}vatar), which eliminates the domain priors in talking avatar generation. In light of the observation that the speech only drives the motion of the avatar while the appearance of the avatar and the background typically remain the same throughout the entire video, we divide our approach into two stages: 1) disentangling each frame into motion and appearance representations; 2) generating motion sequences conditioned on the speech and reference portrait image. We collect a large-scale high-quality talking avatar dataset and train the model on it with different scales (up to 2{B} parameters).},

But standard transformer blocks are far from simple, interweaving attention and {MLP} sub-blocks with skip connections \& normalisation layers in precise arrangements. This complexity leads to brittle architectures, where seemingly minor changes can significantly reduce training speed, or render models untrainable. In this work, we ask to what extent the standard transformer block can be simplified? Combining signal propagation theory and empirical observations, we motivate modifications that allow many block components to be removed with no loss of training speed, including skip connections, projection or value parameters, sequential sub-blocks and normalisation layers. In experiments on both autoregressive decoder-only and {BERT} encoder-only models, our simplified transformers emulate the per-update training speed and performance of standard transformers, while enjoying 15\% faster training throughput.},

  abstract = {Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image synthesis and related generative tasks. Nevertheless, their practicality for low-latency real-world applications is constrained by substantial computational costs and latency issues. Quantization is a dominant way to compress and accelerate diffusion models, where post-training quantization ({PTQ}) and quantization-aware training ({QAT}) are two main approaches, each bearing its own properties. While {PTQ} exhibits efficiency in terms of both time and data usage, it may lead to diminished performance in low bit-width settings. On the other hand, {QAT} can help alleviate performance degradation but comes with substantial demands on computational and data resources. To further enhance performance, we introduce scale-aware optimization to address ineffective learning of {QALoRA} due to variations in weight quantization scales across different layers. We also employ temporal learned step-size quantization to handle notable variations in activation distributions across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous {PTQ}-based diffusion models while maintaining similar time and data efficiency. Specifically, there is only a marginal 0.05 sFID increase when quantizing both weights and activations of {LDM}-4 to 4-bit on {I}mage{N}et $256\times256$. Compared to {QAT}-based methods, our {EfficientDM} also boasts a $16.2\times$ faster quantization speed with comparable generation quality.},

  abstract = {The paper proposes a concise neural operator architecture for operator learning. Drawing an analogy with a conventional fully connected neural network, they define the neural operator where the output of the $i$-th neuron in a nonlinear operator layer is defined by $O_i(u) = \sigma(\sum_j W_{ij} u + B_{ij})$. Here, $W_{ij}$ denotes the bounded linear operator connecting $j$-th input neuron to $i$-th output neuron, and the bias $B_{ij}$ takes the form of a function rather than a scalar. Given its new universal approximation property, the efficient parameterization of the bounded linear operators between two neurons ({B}anach spaces) plays a critical role. As a result, they introduce {MgNO}, utilizing multigrid structures to parameterize these linear operators between neurons. This approach offers both mathematical rigor and practical expressivity. Additionally, {MgNO} obviates the need for conventional lifting and projecting operators typically required in previous neural operators. Their empirical observations reveal that {MgNO} exhibits superior ease of training compared to other {CNN}-based models, while also displaying a reduced susceptibility to overfitting when contrasted with spectral-type neural operators. They demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of their method with consistently state-of-the-art performance on different types of partial differential equations ({PDE}s).},

  abstract = {Camouflaged object detection (COD) is the challenging task of identifying camouflaged objects visually blended into surroundings. Albeit achieving remarkable success, existing COD detectors still struggle to obtain precise results in some challenging cases. To handle this problem, we draw inspiration from the prey-vs-predator game that leads preys to develop better camouflage and predators to acquire more acute vision systems and develop algorithms from both the prey side and the predator side. On the prey side, we propose an adversarial training framework, Camouflageator, which introduces an auxiliary generator to generate more camouflaged objects that are harder for a COD method to detect. Camouflageator trains the generator and detector in an adversarial way such that the enhanced auxiliary generator helps produce a stronger detector. On the predator side, we introduce a novel COD method, called Internal Coherence and Edge Guidance (ICEG), which introduces a camouflaged feature coherence module to excavate the internal coherence of camouflaged objects, striving to obtain more complete segmentation results. Additionally, ICEG proposes a novel edge-guided separated calibration module to remove false predictions to avoid obtaining ambiguous boundaries. Extensive experiments show that ICEG outperforms existing COD detectors and Camouflageator is flexible to improve various COD detectors, including ICEG, which brings state-of-the-art COD performance.},

In this paper, we leverage neural networks for the angular synchronization problem, and its heterogeneous extension, by proposing GNNSync, a theoretically-grounded end-to-end trainable framework using directed graph neural networks.

Recently, training-free NAS as an emerging paradigm has successfully reduced the search costs of standard training-based NAS by estimating the true architecture performance with only training-free metrics. Nevertheless, the estimation ability of these metrics typically varies across different tasks, making it challenging to achieve robust and consistently good search performance on diverse tasks with only a single training-free metric. Meanwhile, the estimation gap between training-free metrics and the true architecture performances limits training-free NAS to achieve superior performance. To address these challenges, we propose the robustifying and boosting training-free NAS (RoBoT) algorithm which (a) employs the optimized combination of existing training-free metrics explored from Bayesian optimization to develop a robust and consistently better-performing metric on diverse tasks, and (b) applies greedy search, i.e., the exploitation, on the newly developed metric to bridge the aforementioned gap and consequently to boost the search performance of standard training-free NAS further. Remarkably, the expected performance of our RoBoT can be theoretically guaranteed, which improves over the existing training-free NAS under mild conditions with additional interesting insights. Our extensive experiments on various NAS benchmark tasks yield substantial empirical evidence to support our theoretical results.},

  abstract = {In this work, we investigate the capability of generating images from pre-trained diffusion models at much higher resolutions than the training image sizes. In addition, the generated images should have arbitrary image aspect ratios. When generating images directly at a higher resolution, 1024 x 1024, with the pre-trained Stable Diffusion using training images of resolution 512 x 512, we observe persistent problems of object repetition and unreasonable object structures. Existing works for higher-resolution generation, such as attention-based and joint-diffusion approaches, cannot well address these issues. As a new perspective, we examine the structural components of the U-Net in diffusion models and identify the crucial cause as the limited perception field of convolutional kernels. Based on this key observation, we propose a simple yet effective re-dilation that can dynamically adjust the convolutional perception field during inference. We further propose the dispersed convolution and noise-damped classifier-free guidance, which can enable ultra-high-resolution image generation (e.g., 4096 x 4096). Notably, our approach does not require any training or optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can address the repetition issue well and achieve state-of-the-art performance on higher-resolution image synthesis, especially in texture details. Our work also suggests that a pre-trained diffusion model trained on low-resolution images can be directly used for high-resolution visual generation without further tuning, which may provide insights for future research on ultra-high-resolution image and video synthesis.},

  abstract = {We study infinite-horizon average-reward Markov decision processes (AMDPs) in the context of general function approximation. Specifically, we propose a novel algorithmic framework named Local-fitted Optimization with OPtimism (LOOP), which incorporates both model-based and value-based incarnations. In particular, LOOP features a novel construction of confidence sets and a low-switching policy updating scheme, which are tailored to the average-reward and function approximation setting. Moreover, for AMDPs, we propose a novel complexity measure -- average-reward generalized eluder coefficient (AGEC) -- which captures the challenge of exploration in AMDPs with general function approximation. Such a complexity measure encompasses almost all previously known tractable AMDP models, such as linear AMDPs and linear mixture AMDPs, and also includes newly identified cases such as kernel AMDPs and AMDPs with Bellman eluder dimensions. Using AGEC, we prove that LOOP achieves a sublinear $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{poly}(d, \mathrm{sp}(V^*)) \sqrt{T\beta} )$ regret, where $d$ and $\beta$ correspond to AGEC and log-covering number of the hypothesis class respectively, $\mathrm{sp}(V^*)$ is the span of the optimal state bias function, $T$ denotes the number of steps, and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} (\cdot) $ omits logarithmic factors. When specialized to concrete AMDP models, our regret bounds are comparable to those established by the existing algorithms designed specifically for these special cases. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first comprehensive theoretical framework capable of handling nearly all AMDPs.},

Typically RLHF algorithms operate in two phases: first, use human preferences to learn a reward function and second, align the model by optimizing the learned reward via reinforcement learning (RL). This paradigm assumes that human preferences are distributed according to reward, but recent work suggests that they instead follow the regret under the user's optimal policy. Thus, learning a reward function from feedback is not only based on a flawed assumption of human preference, but also leads to unwieldy optimization challenges that stem from policy gradients or bootstrapping in the RL phase. We introduce Contrastive Preference Learning (CPL), an algorithm for learning optimal policies from preferences without learning reward functions. CPL learns policies via a simple contrastive objective that can be applied to arbitrary MDPs. This approach circumvents the need for RL entirely, avoiding the associated challenges while being fully off-policy. Our experiments demonstrate that CPL is competitive with or outperforms existing RLHF methods across a variety of tasks including robotics, language modeling, and image generation, while being significantly simpler to implement and tune.},

@inproceedings{hendawy2024multitask,
  abstract = {Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning (MTRL) tackles the long-standing problem of endowing agents with skills that generalize across a variety of problems. To this end, sharing representations plays a fundamental role in capturing both unique and common characteristics of the tasks. Tasks may exhibit similarities in terms of skills, objects, or physical properties while leveraging their representations eases the achievement of a universal policy. Nevertheless, the pursuit of learning a shared set of diverse representations is still an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for representation learning in MTRL that encapsulates common structures among the tasks using orthogonal representations to promote diversity. Our method, named Mixture Of Orthogonal Experts (MOORE), leverages a Gram-Schmidt process to shape a shared subspace of representations generated by a mixture of experts. When task-specific information is provided, MOORE generates relevant representations from this shared subspace. We assess the effectiveness of our approach on two MTRL benchmarks, namely MiniGrid and MetaWorld, showing that MOORE surpasses related baselines and establishes a new state-of-the-art result on MetaWorld.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success across various tasks. However, efficiently serving LLMs has been a challenge due to the large memory bottleneck, specifically in small batch inference settings. Weight-only quantization can be a promising approach, but sub-4 bit quantization remains a challenge due to large-magnitude activation outliers. To mitigate the undesirable outlier effect, we first propose per-IC quantization, a simple yet effective method that creates quantization groups within each input channel (IC) rather than the conventional per-output channel (OC). Our method is motivated by the observation that activation outliers affect the input dimension of the weight matrix, so similarly grouping the weights in the IC direction can isolate outliers to be within a group. With per-IC quantization as a new outlier-friendly scheme, we propose Adaptive Dimensions (AdaDim), a versatile quantization framework that can adapt to various weight sensitivity patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaDim by augmenting prior methods such as Round-To-Nearest and GPTQ, showing significant improvements across various language modeling benchmarks for both base (up to +4.7% on MMLU) and instruction-tuned (up to +10% on HumanEval) LLMs.},

  abstract = {Deep-learning models can extract a rich assortment of features from data. Which features a model uses depends not only on predictivity -- how reliably a feature indicates training-set labels -- but also on availability -- how easily the feature can be extracted from inputs. The literature on shortcut learning has noted examples in which models privilege one feature over another, for example texture over shape and image backgrounds over foreground objects. Here, we test hypotheses about which input properties are more available to a model, and systematically study how predictivity and availability interact to shape models' feature use. We construct a minimal, explicit generative framework for synthesis of classification datasets with two latent features that can be varied independently and along interpretable dimensions including predictivity and availability. We train linear models and deep neural networks on these synthetic datasets, and identify predictivity and availability through both theory and experiments. Our results show that linear models are well-described by a natural formalization of the predictivity--availability trade-off, and that in neural networks, this trade-off is further modulated by feature interactions.},

Using linear algebra, we show that relation computations in language models are equivalent to an implicit linear map on subject representations.

  abstract = {Large language models ({LLM}s) hold great potential for many natural language applications but risk generating incorrect or toxic content. To probe when an {LLM} generates unwanted content, the current paradigm is to recruit a red team of human testers to design input prompts (i.e., test cases) that elicit undesirable responses from {LLM}s. However, relying solely on human testers is expensive and time-consuming. Recent works automate red teaming by training a separate red team {LLM} with reinforcement learning ({RL}) to generate test cases that maximize the chance of eliciting undesirable responses from the target {LLM}. However, current {RL} methods are only able to generate a small number of effective test cases resulting in a low coverage of the span of prompts that elicit undesirable responses from the target {LLM}. To overcome this limitation, we draw a connection between the problem of increasing the coverage of generated test cases and the well-studied approach of curiosity-driven exploration that optimizes for novelty. Our method of curiosity-driven red teaming ({CRT}) achieves greater coverage of test cases while maintaining or increasing their effectiveness compared to existing methods. Our method, {CRT} successfully provokes toxic responses from {LLaMA}2 model that has been heavily fine-tuned using human preferences to avoid toxic outputs.},

@inproceedings{hong2024improving,
  abstract = {Non-transferable learning ({NTL}) aims to restrict the generalization of models toward the target domain(s). To this end, existing works learn non-transferable representations by reducing statistical dependence between the source and target domain. However, such statistical methods essentially neglect to distinguish between styles and contents, leading them to inadvertently fit (i) spurious correlation between styles and labels, and (ii) fake independence between contents and labels. Consequently, their performance will be limited when natural distribution shifts occur or malicious intervention is imposed. In this paper, we propose a novel method (dubbed as {H}-{NTL}) to understand and advance the {NTL} problem by introducing a causal model to separately model content and style as two latent factors, based on which we disentangle and harness them as guidances for learning non-transferable representations with intrinsically causal relationships. Specifically, to avoid fitting spurious correlation and fake independence, we propose a variational inference framework to disentangle the naturally mixed content factors and style factors under our causal model. Subsequently, based on dual-path knowledge distillation, we harness the disentangled two factors as guidances for non-transferable representation learning: (i) we constraint the source domain representations to fit content factors (which are the intrinsic cause of labels), and (ii) we enforce that the target domain representations fit style factors which barely can predict labels. As a result, the learned feature representations follow optimal untransferability toward the target domain and minimal negative influence on the source domain, thus enabling better {NTL} performance. Empirically, the proposed {H}-{NTL} significantly outperforms competing methods by a large margin.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models ({LLM}s) have emerged as dominant tools for various tasks, particularly when tailored for a specific target by prompt tuning. Nevertheless, concerns surrounding data privacy present obstacles due to the tuned prompts' dependency on sensitive private information. A practical solution is to host a local {LLM} and optimize a soft prompt privately using data. Yet, hosting a local model becomes problematic when model ownership is protected. Alternative methods, like sending data to the model's provider for training, intensify these privacy issues facing an untrusted provider. In this paper, we present a novel solution called Differentially-Private Offsite Prompt Tuning ({DP}-{OPT}) to address this challenge. Our approach involves tuning a discrete prompt on the client side and then applying it to the desired cloud models. We demonstrate that prompts suggested by {LLM}s themselves can be transferred without compromising performance significantly. To ensure that the prompts do not leak private information, we introduce the first private prompt generation mechanism, by a differentially-private ({DP}) ensemble of in-context learning with private demonstrations. With {DP}-{OPT}, generating privacy-preserving prompts by Vicuna-7b can yield competitive performance compared to non-private in-context learning on {GPT}3.5 or local private prompt tuning.},

  abstract = {Diffusion models are generative models that have recently demonstrated impressive performances in terms of sampling quality and density estimation in high dimensions. They rely on a forward continuous diffusion process and a backward continuous denoising process, which can be described by a time-dependent vector field and is used as a generative model. In the original formulation of the diffusion model, this vector field is assumed to be the score function (i.e. it is the gradient of the log-probability at a given time in the diffusion process). Curiously, on the practical side, most studies on diffusion models implement this vector field as a neural network function and do not constrain it be the gradient of some energy function (that is, most studies do not constrain the vector field to be conservative). Even though some studies investigated empirically whether such a constraint will lead to a performance gain, they lead to contradicting results and failed to provide analytical results. Here, we provide three analytical results regarding the extent of the modeling freedom of this vector field. Firstly, we propose a novel decomposition of vector fields into a conservative component and an orthogonal component which satisfies a given (gauge) freedom. Secondly, from this orthogonal decomposition, we show that exact density estimation and exact sampling is achieved when the conservative component is exactly equals to the true score and therefore conservativity is neither necessary nor sufficient to obtain exact density estimation and exact sampling. Finally, we show that when it comes to inferring local information of the data manifold, constraining the vector field to be conservative is desirable.},

We critically analyse the use of human feedback for both training and evaluation, to verify whether it fully captures a range of crucial error criteria. We find that while preference scores have fairly good coverage, they under-represent important aspects like factuality. We further hypothesise that both preference scores and error annotation may be affected by confounders, and leverage instruction-tuned models to generate outputs that vary along two possible confounding dimensions: assertiveness and complexity. We find that the assertiveness of an output skews the perceived rate of factuality errors, indicating that human annotations are not a fully reliable evaluation metric or training objective. Finally, we offer preliminary evidence that using human feedback as a training objective disproportionately increases the assertiveness of model outputs. We encourage future work to carefully consider whether preference scores are well aligned with the desired objective.},

  abstract = {Motivated by a recent neuroscientific hypothesis, some theoretical studies have accounted for neural cognitive maps in the rodent hippocampal formation as a representation of the general relational structure across task environments. However, despite their remarkable results, it is unclear whether their account can be extended to more general settings beyond spatial random-walk tasks in {2D} environments. To address this question, we construct a novel cognitive model that performs memory-based relational decision-making tasks, inspired by previous human studies, for learning abstract structures in non-spatial relations. Building on previous approaches of modular architecture, we develop a learning algorithm that performs reward-guided search for representation of abstract relations, while dynamically maintaining their binding to concrete entities using our specific memory mechanism enabling content replacement. Our experiments show (i) the capability of our model to capture relational structures that can generalize over new domains with unseen entities, (ii) the difficulty of our task that leads previous models, including Neural Turing Machine and vanilla Transformer, to complete failure, and (iii) the similarity of performance and internal representations of our model to recent human behavioral and {fMRI} experimental data in the human hippocampal formation.},

  abstract = {Pre-trained transformers are often fine-tuned to aid clinical decision-making using limited clinical notes. Model interpretability is crucial, especially in high-stakes domains like medicine, to establish trust and ensure safety, which requires human engagement. We introduce {SUFO}, a systematic framework that enhances interpretability of fine-tuned transformer feature spaces. {SUFO} utilizes a range of analytic and visualization techniques, including Supervised probing, Unsupervised similarity analysis, Feature dynamics, and Outlier analysis to address key questions about model trust and interpretability (e.g. model suitability for a task, feature space evolution during fine-tuning, and interpretation of fine-tuned features and failure modes). We conduct a case study investigating the impact of pre-training data where we focus on real-world pathology classification tasks, and validate our findings on {MedNLI}. We evaluate five 110M-sized pre-trained transformer models, categorized into general-domain ({BERT}, {TNLR}), mixed-domain ({BioBERT}, Clinical {BioBERT}), and domain-specific ({PubMedBERT}) groups. Our {SUFO} analyses reveal that: (1) while {PubMedBERT}, the domain-specific model, contains valuable information for fine-tuning, it can overfit to minority classes when class imbalances exist. In contrast, mixed-domain models exhibit greater resistance to overfitting, suggesting potential improvements in domain-specific model robustness; (2) in-domain pre-training accelerates feature disambiguation during fine-tuning; and (3) feature spaces undergo significant sparsification during this process, enabling clinicians to identify common outlier modes among fine-tuned models as demonstrated in this paper. These findings showcase the utility of {SUFO} in enhancing trust and safety when using transformers in medicine, and we believe {SUFO} can aid practitioners in evaluating fine-tuned language models ({LM}s) for other applications in medicine and in more critical domains.},

@inproceedings{hsu2024dropoutbased,
  abstract = {Predictive multiplicity refers to the phenomenon in which classification tasks may admit multiple competing models that achieve almost-equally-optimal performance, yet generate conflicting outputs for individual samples. This presents significant concerns, as it can potentially result in systemic exclusion, inexplicable discrimination, and unfairness in practical applications. Measuring and mitigating predictive multiplicity, however, is computationally challenging due to the need to explore all such almost-equally-optimal models, known as the Rashomon set, in potentially huge hypothesis spaces. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that utilizes dropout techniques for exploring models in the Rashomon set. We provide rigorous theoretical derivations to connect the dropout parameters to properties of the Rashomon set, and empirically evaluate our framework through extensive experimentation. Numerical results show that our technique consistently outperforms baselines in terms of the effectiveness of predictive multiplicity metric estimation, with runtime speedup up to 20$\times$ to 5000$\times$. With efficient Rashomon set exploration and metric estimation, mitigation of predictive multiplicity is then achieved through dropout ensemble and model selection.},

To enhance coordination among these agents, a distributed communication framework is often employed. However, information sharing among all agents proves to be resource-intensive, while the adoption of a manually pre-defined communication architecture imposes limitations on inter-agent communication, thereby constraining the potential for collaborative efforts. In this study, we introduce a novel approach wherein we conceptualize the communication architecture among agents as a learnable graph. We formulate this problem as the task of determining the communication graph while enabling the architecture parameters to update normally, thus necessitating a bi-level optimization process. Utilizing continuous relaxation of the graph representation and incorporating attention units, our proposed approach, {CommFormer}, efficiently optimizes the communication graph and concurrently refines architectural parameters through gradient descent in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on a variety of cooperative tasks substantiate the robustness of our model across diverse cooperative scenarios, where agents are able to develop more coordinated and sophisticated strategies regardless of changes in the number of agents.},

  abstract = {Recently, neural networks have been extensively employed to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) in physical system modeling. While major studies focus on learning system evolution on predefined static mesh discretizations, some methods utilize reinforcement learning or supervised learning techniques to create adaptive and dynamic meshes, due to the dynamic nature of these systems. However, these approaches face two primary challenges: (1) the need for expensive optimal mesh data, and (2) the change of the solution space's degree of freedom and topology during mesh refinement. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a neural PDE solver with a neural mesh adapter. To begin with, we introduce a novel data-free neural mesh adaptor, called Data-free Mesh Mover (DMM), with two main innovations. Firstly, it is an operator that maps the solution to adaptive meshes and is trained using the Monge-Ampère equation without optimal mesh data. Secondly, it dynamically changes the mesh by moving existing nodes rather than adding or deleting nodes and edges. Theoretical analysis shows that meshes generated by DMM have the lowest interpolation error bound. Based on DMM, to efficiently and accurately model dynamic systems, we develop a moving mesh based neural PDE solver (MM-PDE) that embeds the moving mesh with a two-branch architecture and a learnable interpolation framework to preserve information within the data. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our method generates suitable meshes and considerably enhances accuracy when modeling widely considered PDE systems.

However, the success is typically limited to English, leaving other languages largely behind. Building a competitive counterpart in other languages is highly challenging due to the low-resource nature of non-English multimodal data (i.e., lack of large-scale, high-quality image-text data). In this work, we propose MPM, an effective training paradigm for training large multimodal models in low-resource languages. MPM demonstrates that Multilingual language models can Pivot zero-shot Multimodal learning across languages. Specifically, based on a strong multilingual large language model, multimodal models pretrained on English-only image-text data can well generalize to other languages in a (quasi)-zero-shot manner, even surpassing models trained on image-text data in native languages. Taking Chinese as a practice of MPM, we build large multimodal models VisCPM in image-to-text and text-to-image generation, which achieve state-of-the-art (open-source) performance in Chinese.

The latest work proposes a GER benchmark with "HyPoradise" dataset to learn the mapping from ASR N-best hypotheses to ground-truth transcription by efficient LLM finetuning, which shows great effectiveness but lacks specificity on noise-robust ASR. In this work, we extend the benchmark to noisy conditions and investigate if we can teach LLMs to perform denoising for GER just like what robust ASR do, where one solution is introducing noise information as a conditioner into LLM. However, directly incorporating noise embeddings from audio encoder could harm the LLM tuning due to cross-modality gap. To this end, we propose to extract a language-space noise embedding from the N-best list to represent the noise conditions of source speech. Experiments on various latest LLMs show the proposed approach achieves a new breakthrough on RobustHP with up to 53.9\% GER improvement in terms of word error rate (WER). Analysis verifies the effectiveness of our proposed language-space embedding to represent audio noise, under which LLMs show strong ability of language-space denoising.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have recently driven striking performance improvements across a range of natural language processing tasks. The factual knowledge acquired during pretraining and instruction tuning can be useful in various downstream tasks, such as question answering, and language generation. Unlike conventional Knowledge Bases (KBs) that explicitly store factual knowledge, LLMs implicitly store facts in their parameters. Content generated by the LLMs can often exhibit inaccuracies or deviations from the truth, due to facts that can be incorrectly induced or become obsolete over time. To this end, we aim to explore the extent and scope of factual knowledge within LLMs by designing the benchmark Pinocchio. Pinocchio contains 20K diverse factual questions that span different sources, timelines, domains, regions, and languages. Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs can compose multiple facts, update factual knowledge temporally, reason over multiple pieces of facts, identify subtle factual differences, and resist adversarial examples. Extensive experiments on different sizes and types of LLMs show that existing LLMs still lack factual knowledge and suffer from various spurious correlations. We believe this is a critical bottleneck for realizing trustworthy artificial intelligence. The dataset Pinocchio and our codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/THU-BPM/Pinocchio.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel modular network framework, called Scalable Modular Network (SMN), which enables adaptive learning capability and supports integration of new modules after pre-training for better adaptation. This adaptive capability comes from a novel design of router within SMN, named agreement router, which selects and composes different specialist modules through an iterative message passing process. The agreement router iteratively computes the agreements among a set of input and outputs of all modules to allocate inputs to specific module. During the iterative routing, messages of modules are passed to each other, which improves the module selection process with consideration of both local interactions (between a single module and input) and global interactions involving multiple other modules. To validate our contributions, we conduct experiments on two problems: a toy min-max game and few-shot image classification task. Our experimental results demonstrate that SMN can generalize to new distributions and exhibit sample-efficient adaptation to new tasks. Furthermore, SMN can achieve a better adaptation capability when new modules are introduced after pre-training.},

One approach to mitigating this risk is to incorporate watermarking techniques into LLMs, allowing for the tracking and attribution of model outputs. This study examines a crucial aspect of watermarking: how significantly watermarks impact the quality of model-generated outputs. Previous studies have suggested a trade-off between watermark strength and output quality. However, our research demonstrates that it is possible to integrate watermarks without affecting the output probability distribution with appropriate implementation. We refer to this type of watermark as an unbiased watermark. This has significant implications for the use of LLMs, as it becomes impossible for users to discern whether a service provider has incorporated watermarks or not. Furthermore, the presence of watermarks does not compromise the performance of the model in downstream tasks, ensuring that the overall utility of the language model is preserved. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion around responsible AI development, suggesting that unbiased watermarks can serve as an effective means of tracking and attributing model outputs without sacrificing output quality.},

  abstract = {We study a family of distributed stochastic optimization algorithms where gradients are sampled by a token traversing a network of agents in random-walk fashion. Typically, these random-walks are chosen to be Markov chains that asymptotically sample from a desired target distribution, and play a critical role in the convergence of the optimization iterates. In this paper, we take a novel approach by replacing the standard linear Markovian token by one which follows a nonlinear Markov chain - namely the Self-Repellent Random Walk (SRRW). Defined for any given 'base' Markov chain, the SRRW, parameterized by a positive scalar α, is less likely to transition to states that were highly visited in the past, thus the name. In the context of MCMC sampling on a graph, a recent breakthrough in Doshi et al. (2023) shows that the SRRW achieves O(1/α) decrease in the asymptotic variance for sampling. We propose the use of a 'generalized' version of the SRRW to drive token algorithms for distributed stochastic optimization in the form of stochastic approximation, termed SA-SRRW. We prove that the optimization iterate errors of the resulting SA-SRRW converge to zero almost surely and prove a central limit theorem, deriving the explicit form of the resulting asymptotic covariance matrix corresponding to iterate errors. This asymptotic covariance is always smaller than that of an algorithm driven by the base Markov chain and decreases at rate O(1/α²) - the performance benefit of using SRRW thereby amplified in the stochastic optimization context. Empirical results support our theoretical findings.},

A traditional DL approach to DIR is based on training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate the registration field between two input images. While conceptually simple, this approach comes with a limitation that it exclusively relies on a pre-trained CNN without explicitly enforcing fidelity between the registered image and the reference. We present plug-and-play image registration network (PIRATE) as a new DIR method that addresses this issue by integrating an explicit data-fidelity penalty and a CNN prior. PIRATE pre-trains a CNN denoiser on the registration field and 'plugs' it into an iterative method as a regularizer. We additionally present PIRATE+ that fine-tunes the CNN prior in PIRATE using deep equilibrium models (DEQ). PIRATE+ interprets the fixed-point iteration of PIRATE as a network with effectively infinite layers and then trains the resulting network end-to-end, enabling it to learn more task-specific information and boosting its performance. Our numerical results on OASIS and CANDI datasets show that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on DIR.},

This limits tractable querying of this knowledge to start-to-end autoregressive sampling. However, many tasks of interest---including sequence continuation, infilling, and other forms of constrained generation---involve sampling from intractable posterior distributions. We address this limitation by using amortized Bayesian inference to sample from these intractable posteriors. Such amortization is algorithmically achieved by fine-tuning LLMs via diversity-seeking reinforcement learning algorithms: generative flow networks (GFlowNets). We empirically demonstrate that this distribution-matching paradigm of LLM fine-tuning can serve as an effective alternative to maximum-likelihood training and reward-maximizing policy optimization. As an important application, we interpret chain-of-thought reasoning as a latent variable modeling problem and demonstrate that our approach enables data-efficient adaptation of LLMs to tasks that require multi-step rationalization and tool use.},

Although they empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of data augmentation for improving sample efficiency or generalization, which technique should be preferred is not always clear. To tackle this question, we analyze existing methods to better understand them and to uncover how they are connected. Notably, by expressing the variance of the Q-targets and that of the empirical actor/critic losses of these methods, we can analyze the effects of their different components and compare them. We furthermore formulate an explanation about how these methods may be affected by choosing different data augmentation transformations in calculating the target Q-values. This analysis suggests recommendations on how to exploit data augmentation in a more principled way. In addition, we include a regularization term called tangent prop, previously proposed in computer vision, but whose adaptation to DRL is novel to the best of our knowledge. We evaluate our proposition and validate our analysis in several domains. Compared to different relevant baselines, we demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in most environments and shows higher sample efficiency and better generalization ability in some complex environments.},

  abstract = {The scientific scale-up of large language models (LLMs) necessitates a comprehensive understanding of their scaling properties. However, the existing literature on the scaling properties only yields an incomplete answer: optimization loss decreases predictably as the model size increases, in line with established scaling law; yet no scaling law for task has been established and the task performances are far from predictable during scaling. Task performances typically show minor gains on small models until they improve dramatically once models exceed a size threshold, exemplifying the ''emergent abilities''. In this study, we discover that small models, although they exhibit minor performance, demonstrate critical and consistent task performance improvements that are not captured by conventional evaluation strategies due to insufficient measurement resolution. To measure such improvements, we introduce PassUntil, an evaluation strategy with theoretically infinite resolution, through massive sampling in the decoding phase. With PassUntil, we conduct a quantitative investigation into the scaling law of task performance. The investigation contains two parts. Firstly, a strict task scaling law that is not conventionally known to exist, is identified, enhancing the predictability of task performances. Remarkably, we are able to predict the performance of the 2.4B model on code generation with merely 0.05\% deviation before training starts, which is the first systematic attempt to verify predictable scaling proposed by GPT-4's report. Secondly, underpinned by PassUntil, we are able to study emergent abilities quantitatively. We identify a kind of accelerated emergence whose scaling curve cannot be fitted by standard scaling law function and has a increasing speed. We then examine two hypothesis and imply that the ``multiple circuits hypothesis'' might be responsible for the accelerated emergence.},

@inproceedings{hu2024recipe,
  abstract = {Recent studies have highlighted the potential of Lipschitz-based methods for training certifiably robust neural networks against adversarial attacks. A key challenge, supported both theoretically and empirically, is that robustness demands greater network capacity and more data than standard training. However, effectively adding capacity under stringent Lipschitz constraints has proven more difficult than it may seem, evident by the fact that state-of-the-art approach tend more towards underfitting than overfitting. Moreover, we posit that a lack of careful exploration of the design space for Lipshitz-based approaches has left potential performance gains on the table. In this work, we provide a more comprehensive evaluation to better uncover the potential of Lipschitz-based certification methods. Using a combination of novel techniques, design optimizations, and synthesis of prior work, we are able to significantly improve the state-of-the-art VRA for deterministic certification on a variety of benchmark datasets, and over a range of perturbation sizes. Of particular note, we discover that the addition of large 'Cholesky-orthogonalized residual dense' layers to the end of existing state-of-the-art Lipschitz-controlled ResNet architectures is especially effective for increasing network capacity and performance. Combined with filtered generative data augmentation, our final results further the state of the art deterministic VRA by up to 8.5 percentage points.},

@inproceedings{hu2024querypolicy,
  abstract = {Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) provides a natural way to align RL agents' behavior with human desired outcomes, but is often restrained by costly human feedback. The key to addressing this issue lies in how to select queries such that the preference oracle gives the most useful information about the reward function. Previous methods have focused on designing better query selection schemes, however, they do not consider the underlying learning dynamics, and thus may not be compatible with how policies are optimized. In this work, we identify a problem called query-policy misalignment: queries selected to improve the reward model may not actually benefit policy learning. We show both theoretically and empirically that this phenomenon can seriously impact the learning outcome. To this end, we propose a new method called policy-aligned query selection which not only improves the reward model but also takes into account policy learning dynamics. We design a policy-aligned query and a specially designed hybrid experience replay to address the query-policy misalignment issue. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over existing approaches on a diverse set of tasks and empirically validates the importance of considering policy learning dynamics in query selection.},

@inproceedings{hu2024treeplanner,
  abstract = {This paper studies close-loop task planning, which refers to the process of generating a sequence of skills (a plan) to accomplish a specific goal while adapting the plan based on real-time observations. Recently, prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate actions iteratively has become a prevalent paradigm due to its superior performance and user-friendliness. However, this paradigm is plagued by two inefficiencies: high token consumption and redundant error correction, both of which hinder its scalability for large-scale testing and applications. To address these issues, we propose Tree-Planner, which reframes task planning with LLMs into three distinct phases: plan sampling, action tree construction, and grounded deciding. Tree-Planner starts by using an LLM to sample a set of potential plans before execution, followed by the aggregation of them to form an action tree. Finally, the LLM performs a top-down decision-making process on the tree, taking into account real-time environmental information. Experiments show that Tree-Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high efficiency. By decomposing LLM queries into a single plan-sampling call and multiple grounded-deciding calls, a considerable part of the prompt are less likely to be repeatedly consumed. As a result, token consumption is reduced by 92.2\% compared to the previously best-performing model. Additionally, by enabling backtracking on the action tree as needed, the correction process becomes more flexible, leading to a 40.5\% decrease in error corrections.},

  abstract = {We need to look at our shoelaces as we first learn to tie them but having mastered this skill, can do it from touch alone. We call this phenomenon 'sensory scaffolding': observation streams that are not needed by a master might yet aid a novice learner. We consider such sensory scaffolding setups for training artificial agents. For example, a robot arm may need to be deployed with just a low-cost, robust, general-purpose camera; yet its performance may improve by having privileged training-time-only access to informative albeit expensive and unwieldy motion capture rigs or fragile tactile sensors. For these settings, we propose 'Scaffolder', a reinforcement learning approach which effectively exploits privileged sensing in critics, world models, reward estimators, and other such auxiliary components that are only used at training time, to improve the target policy. For evaluating sensory scaffolding agents, we design a new 'S3' suite of ten diverse simulated robotic tasks that explore a wide range of practical sensor setups. Agents must use privileged camera sensing to train blind hurdlers, privileged active visual perception to help robot arms overcome visual occlusions, privileged touch sensors to train robot hands, and more. Scaffolder easily outperforms relevant prior baselines and frequently performs comparably even to policies that have test-time access to the privileged sensors.},

@inproceedings{hu2024evoke,
  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have made impressive progress in natural language processing. These models rely on proper human instructions (or prompts) to generate suitable responses. However, the potential of LLMs are not fully harnessed by commonly-used prompting methods: many human-in-the-loop algorithms employ ad-hoc procedures for prompt selection; while auto prompt generation approaches are essentially searching all possible prompts randomly and inefficiently. We propose Evoke, an automatic prompt refinement framework. In Evoke, there are two instances of a same LLM: one as a reviewer (LLM-Reviewer), it scores the current prompt; the other as an author (LLM-Author), it edits the prompt by considering the edit history and the reviewer's feedback. Such an author-reviewer feedback loop ensures that the prompt is refined in each iteration. We further aggregate a data selection approach to Evoke, where only the hard samples are exposed to the LLM. The hard samples are more important because the LLM can develop deeper understanding of the tasks out of them, while the model may already know how to solve the easier cases. Experimental results show that Evoke significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, in the challenging task of logical fallacy detection, Evoke scores above 80, while all other baseline methods struggle to reach 20.},

@inproceedings{hu2024less,
  abstract = {Knowledge distillation aims to train a compact student network using soft supervision from a larger teacher network and hard supervision from ground truths. However, determining an optimal knowledge fusion ratio that balances these supervisory signals remains challenging. Prior methods generally resort to a constant or heuristic-based fusion ratio, which often falls short of a proper balance. In this study, we introduce a novel adaptive method for learning a sample-wise knowledge fusion ratio, exploiting both the correctness of teacher and student, as well as how well the student mimics the teacher on each sample. Our method naturally leads to the intra-sample trilateral geometric relations among the student prediction, teacher prediction, and ground truth. To counterbalance the impact of outliers, we further extend to the inter-sample relations, incorporating the teacher's global average prediction for samples within the same class. A simple neural network then learns the implicit mapping from the intra- and inter-sample relations to an adaptive, sample-wise knowledge fusion ratio in a bilevel-optimization manner. Our approach provides a simple, practical, and adaptable solution for knowledge distillation that can be employed across various architectures and model sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over other loss re-weighting methods on image classification, attack detection, and click-through rate prediction.},

First, we introduce mutual information maximization to formalize role representation learning, derive a contrastive learning objective, and concisely approximate the distribution of negative pairs.

@inproceedings{hu2024augmenting,
  abstract = {We present ReCAT, a recursive composition augmented Transformer that is able to explicitly model hierarchical syntactic structures of raw texts without relying on gold trees during both learning and inference. Existing research along this line restricts data to follow a hierarchical tree structure and thus lacks inter-span communications. To overcome the problem, we propose a novel contextual inside-outside (CIO) layer that learns contextualized representations of spans through bottom-up and top-down passes, where a bottom-up pass forms representations of high-level spans by composing low-level spans, while a top-down pass combines information inside and outside a span. By stacking several CIO layers between the embedding layer and the attention layers in Transformer, ReCAT can perform both deep intra-span and deep inter-span interactions, and thus generate multi-grained representations fully contextualized with other spans. The CIO layers can be jointly pre-trained with Transformers, making ReCAT enjoy scaling ability, strong performance, and interpretability at the same time. Evaluation results indicate that ReCAT can significantly outperform vanilla Transformer models on all span-level tasks and baselines that combine recursive networks with Transformers on natural language inference tasks. The hierarchical structures induced by ReCAT exhibit strong consistency with human-annotated syntactic trees, indicating good interpretability brought by the CIO layers.},

Despite extensive empirical research and practical applications, a systematic way to theoretically understand the convergence and generalization properties in {FL} remains limited. This work aims to establish a unified theoretical foundation for understanding {FL} through feature learning theory. We focus on a scenario where each client employs a two-layer convolutional neural network ({CNN}) for local training on their own data. Many existing works analyze the convergence of Federated Averaging ({FedAvg}) under lazy training with linearizing assumptions in weight space. In contrast, our approach tracks the trajectory of signal learning and noise memorization in {FL}, eliminating the need for these assumptions. We further show that {FedAvg} can achieve near-zero test error by effectively increasing signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) in feature learning, while local training without communication achieves a large constant test error. This finding highlights the benefits of communication for generalization in {FL}. Moreover, our theoretical results suggest that a weighted {FedAvg} method, based on the similarity of input features across clients, can effectively tackle data heterogeneity issues in {FL}. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets verify our theoretical conclusions and emphasize the effectiveness of the weighted {FedAvg} approach.},

Existing diffusion models primarily focus on incorporating protein-ligand interaction information solely in the reverse process, and neglect the interactions in the forward process. The inconsistency between forward and reverse processes may impair the binding affinity of generated molecules towards target protein. To bridge this gap, we propose IPDiff, a novel approach that integrates protein-ligand interaction prior into both diffusion and sampling process. We begin by pretraining a protein-ligand interaction prior network (IPNet) by utilizing the binding affinity signals as supervision. We then leverage the pretrained prior network to (1) integrate interactions between the target protein and the molecular ligand into the forward process for adapting the molecule diffusion trajectories (prior-shifting), and (2) enhance the binding-aware molecule sampling process (prior-conditioning). Empirical studies on CrossDocked2020 dataset show IPDiff can generate molecules with more realistic 3D structures and state-of-the-art binding affinities towards the protein targets, with up to -6.42 Avg.

Dimensional collapse, also known as the underfilling phenomenon, is one of the major causes of degraded performance on downstream tasks. While previous work has investigated the dimensional collapse problem of SSL at a global level, we demonstrate that representations can span over high dimensional space globally, but collapse locally. To address this, we propose a method called local dimensionality regularization (LDReg). LDReg introduces a novel approach by regularizing the local intrinsic dimensionality (LID) of representations. By maximizing the distance between local distance distributions and a target distribution, LDReg aims to prevent representations from collapsing locally to lower-dimensional subspaces. Our experiments demonstrate that LDReg improves the representation quality of SSL methods and achieves superior performance on downstream tasks.},

Rehearsal-free CIL methods struggle with distinguishing classes from different tasks, as those are not trained together. In this work we propose a regularization method based on virtual outliers to tighten decision boundaries of the classifier, such that confusion of classes among different tasks is mitigated. Recent prompt-based methods often require a pool of task-specific prompts, in order to prevent overwriting knowledge of previous tasks with that of the new task, leading to extra computation in querying and composing an appropriate prompt from the pool. This additional cost can be eliminated, without sacrificing accuracy, as we reveal in the paper. We illustrate that a simplified prompt-based method can achieve results comparable to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods equipped with a prompt pool, using much less learnable parameters and lower inference cost. Our regularization method has demonstrated its compatibility with different prompt-based methods, boosting those previous SOTA rehearsal-free CIL methods' accuracy on the ImageNet-R and CIFAR-100 benchmarks.},

Synthesizing financial time series to augment real-world data is challenging due to the irregular and scale-invariant patterns uniquely associated with financial time series – temporal dynamics that repeat with varying duration and magnitude. To tackle this challenge, we develop a novel generative framework called FTS-Diffusion to model irregular and scale-invariant patterns that consists of three modules. First, we develop a scale-invariant pattern recognition algorithm to extract recurring patterns that vary in duration and magnitude. Second, we construct a diffusion-based generative network to synthesize segments of patterns. Third, we model the temporal transition of patterns in order to aggregate the generated segments. Extensive experiments show that FTS-Diffusion generates synthetic financial time series highly resembling observed data, outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives. Two downstream experiments demonstrate that augmenting real-world data with synthetic data generated by FTS-Diffusion reduces the error of stock market prediction by up to 17.9 percent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on generating intricate time series with irregular and scale-invariant patterns, addressing data limitation issues in finance.},

We investigate whether such benefits can extend to more general sequential decision making problems such as partially observable MDPs (POMDPs) and more general predictive state representations (PSRs). The main challenge is that the large and complex model space makes it hard to identify what types of common latent structure of multi-task PSRs can reduce model complexity and improve sample efficiency. We propose using a joint model class for tasks and use the notion of η-bracketing number to quantify its complexity, which also serves as a general metric to capture task similarity and thus determines the benefit of multi-task over single-task RL. Our theoretical analysis reveals that under certain conditions on task similarity, multi-task RL achieves improved sample complexity compared to single-task approaches, providing the first theoretical guarantees for multi-task learning benefits in non-Markovian settings.},

By estimating the means of regularized posterior distributions, we derive a novel Monte Carlo sampling algorithm called reverse diffusion Monte Carlo (rdMC), which is distinct from Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We determine the sample size from the error tolerance and properties of the posterior distribution to yield an algorithm that can approximately sample the target distribution with any desired accuracy. We demonstrate and prove under suitable conditions that sampling with rdMC can be significantly faster than MCMC methods. For multi-modal target distributions such as Gaussian mixture models, rdMC greatly improves over Langevin-style MCMC sampling methods both theoretically and in practice.},

@inproceedings{huang2024catastrophic,
  abstract = {The rapid progress in open-source large language models (LLMs) is significantly advancing AI development. Extensive efforts have been made before model release to align their behavior with human values, with the primary goal of ensuring their helpfulness and harmlessness. However, even carefully aligned models can be manipulated maliciously, leading to unintended behaviors, known as "jailbreaks". These jailbreaks are typically triggered by specific text inputs, often referred to as adversarial prompts. In this work, we propose the generation exploitation attack, an extremely simple approach that disrupts model alignment by only manipulating variations of decoding methods. By exploiting different generation strategies, including varying decoding hyper-parameters and sampling methods, we increase the attack success rate from 0\% to more than 95\% across 11 language models including LLaMA2, Vicuna, Falcon, and MPT families, outperforming state-of-the-art attacks. Finally, we propose an effective alignment method that explores diverse generation strategies, which can reasonably reduce the attack success rate under our attack. Altogether, our study underscores a major failure in current safety evaluation and alignment procedures for open-source LLMs, strongly advocating for more comprehensive red teaming and better alignment before releasing such models.},

Training a robotic agent to learn this sequence over many different starting conditions typically requires many iterations or demonstrations, especially in 3D environments. We propose Fourier Transporter (FourTran), which leverages the two-fold SE(d)×SE(d) symmetry in the pick-place problem to achieve much higher sample efficiency. FourTran is an open-loop behavior cloning method trained using expert demonstrations to predict pick-place actions on new environments. FourTran is constrained to incorporate symmetries of the pick and place actions independently. The method utilizes a fiber space Fourier transformation that allows for memory-efficient construction. Tests on the RLbench benchmark achieve state-of-the-art results across various tasks.

Existing classification-based methods for text-image inconsistency can identify contextual inconsistencies but fail to provide explainable justifications for their decisions that humans can understand. Although more nuanced, human evaluation is impractical at scale and susceptible to errors. Instead of employing a binary classification model, we introduce D-TIIL (Diffusion-based Text-Image Inconsistency Localization), which leverages text-to-image diffusion models to locate semantic inconsistencies in text and image pairs. D-TIIL offers interpretable evidence by localizing word- and pixel-level inconsistencies and quantifying them through a consistency score. The method uses text embeddings and modified image regions to visualize these inconsistencies, treating diffusion models trained on large-scale datasets as "omniscient" agents with extensive background knowledge. To evaluate D-TIIL's efficacy, we introduce a new TIIL dataset containing 14K consistent and inconsistent text-image pairs. Unlike existing datasets, TIIL enables assessment at the level of individual words and image regions and is carefully designed to represent various inconsistencies.},

Recent studies have shown that the sequential decision-making problem is statistically learnable if it admits a low-rank structure modeled by predictive state representations (PSRs). Despite these advancements, existing approaches typically involve oracles or steps that are computationally intractable. On the other hand, the upper confidence bound (UCB) based approaches, which have served successfully as computationally efficient methods in bandits and MDPs, have not been investigated for more general PSRs. We develop a provably efficient upper confidence bound algorithm for online and offline low rank decision-making problem, which is modeled by predictive state representation.

@inproceedings{huang2024stability,
  abstract = {Designing effective positional encodings for graphs is key to building powerful graph transformers and enhancing message-passing graph neural networks. Although widespread, using Laplacian eigenvectors as positional encodings faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Non-uniqueness: there are many different eigendecompositions of the same Laplacian, and (2) Instability: small perturbations to the Laplacian could result in completely different eigenspaces, leading to unpredictable changes in positional encoding. Despite many attempts to address non-uniqueness, most methods overlook stability, leading to poor generalization on unseen graph structures. We identify the cause of instability to be a "hard partition" of eigenspaces. Hence, we introduce Stable and Expressive Positional Encodings (SPE), an architecture for processing eigenvectors that uses eigenvalues to "softly partition" eigenspaces. SPE is the first architecture that is (1) provably stable, and (2) universally expressive for basis invariant functions whilst respecting all symmetries of eigenvectors. Besides guaranteed stability, we prove that SPE is at least as expressive as existing methods, and highly capable of counting graph structures. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method on molecular property prediction, and out-of-distribution generalization tasks, finding improved generalization compared to existing positional encoding methods.},

Our paper aims to address this research gap by focusing on semi-supervised node classification. To accomplish this, we develop a curriculum-enhanced attention distillation method that involves utilizing a Local GT teacher and a Global GT student. Additionally, we introduce the concepts of in-class and out-of-class and then propose two improvements, out-of-class entropy and top-k pruning, to facilitate the student's out-of-class exploration under the teacher's in-class guidance. Taking inspiration from human learning, our method involves a curriculum mechanism for distillation that initially provides strict guidance to the student and gradually allows for more out-of-class exploration by a dynamic balance. Experiments demonstrate that our curriculum-enhanced attention distillation method for semi-supervised node classification, leveraging Local and Global Graph Transformers, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on multiple benchmarks.},

We extract different representations of the same dataset using distinct network backbones, and actively learn the linear prediction layer on each representation via an ℓp-regression formulation. The regression problems are solved approximately by sampling and reweighting the unlabeled instances based on their maximum Lewis weights across the representations. An upper bound on the number of samples needed is provided with a rigorous analysis for p∈[1,+∞).

In this paper, we show that the conflict between the 3D optimization process and uniform timestep sampling in score distillation is the main reason for these limitations. To resolve this conflict, we propose to prioritize timestep sampling with monotonically non-increasing functions, which aligns the 3D optimization process with the sampling process of diffusion model.

However, the elements of a set are unordered, which makes this scheme suffer from biased or conflicting training signals. In this paper, we propose a branching decoder, which can generate a dynamic number of tokens at each time-step and branch multiple generation paths. In particular, paths are generated individually so that no order dependence is required. Moreover, multiple paths can be generated in parallel which greatly reduces the inference time.

@inproceedings{huben2024sparse,
  abstract = {One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. The paper explores using sparse autoencoders to identify more interpretable features in language models by addressing the problem of superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons. We use a scalable and unsupervised method called Sparse Autoencoders to find interpretable, monosemantic features in the residual streams of real LLMs (Pythia-70M/410M). The authors demonstrate the ability to pinpoint causally responsible features for counterfactual behavior on the indirect object identification task with finer granularity than previous decompositions. This work indicates it's possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method, potentially serving as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work to enable greater model transparency and steerability.},

Even with access only to the model's output, an attacker can employ black-box attacks to generate such adversarial examples. The paper proposes a simple and lightweight defense against black-box attacks by adding random noise to hidden features at intermediate layers of the model at inference time. Their theoretical analysis confirms that this method effectively enhances the model's resilience against both score-based and decision-based black-box attacks. The defense does not necessitate adversarial training and has minimal impact on accuracy, rendering it applicable to any pre-trained model. Their analysis reveals the significance of selectively adding noise to different parts of the model based on the gradient of the adversarial objective function.},

@inproceedings{hu2024defining,
  abstract = {Decision-makers are often experts of their domain and take actions based on their domain knowledge. Doctors, for instance, may prescribe treatments by predicting the likely outcome of each available treatment. Actions of an expert thus naturally encode part of their domain knowledge, and can help make inferences within the same domain: Knowing doctors try to prescribe the best treatment for their patients, we can tell treatments prescribed more frequently are likely to be more effective. Yet in machine learning, the fact that most decision-makers are experts is often overlooked, and 'expertise' is seldom leveraged as an inductive bias. This is especially true for the literature on treatment effect estimation, where often the only assumption made about actions is that of overlap. In this paper, we argue that expertise---particularly the type of expertise the decision-makers of a domain are likely to have---can be informative in designing and selecting methods for treatment effect estimation. We formally define two types of expertise, predictive and prognostic, and demonstrate empirically that: (i) the prominent type of expertise in a domain significantly influences the performance of different methods in treatment effect estimation, and (ii) it is possible to predict the type of expertise present in a dataset, which can provide a quantitative basis for model selection.},

Bayesian optimization is an automatic, general and sample-efficient method to solve these problems with minimal knowledge of the underlying function dynamics. However, the ability of Bayesian optimization to incorporate prior knowledge or beliefs about the function at hand in order to accelerate the optimization is limited, which reduces its appeal for knowledgeable practitioners with tight budgets. To allow domain experts to customize the optimization routine, we propose {ColaBO}, the first Bayesian-principled framework for incorporating prior beliefs beyond the typical kernel structure, such as the likely location of the optimizer or the optimal value. The generality of {ColaBO} makes it applicable across different Monte Carlo acquisition functions and types of user beliefs. We empirically demonstrate {ColaBO}'s ability to substantially accelerate optimization when the prior information is accurate, and to retain approximately default performance when it is misleading.},

Although the potential benefits of applying data augmentation to {SFDA} are attractive, several challenges arise such as the dependence on prior knowledge of class-preserving transformations and the increase in memory and computational requirements. In this paper, we propose Source-free Domain Adaptation Through the Lens of Data Augmentation ({SF}({DA})$^2$), a novel approach that leverages the benefits of data augmentation without suffering from these challenges. We construct an augmentation graph in the feature space of the pretrained model using the neighbor relationships between target features and propose spectral neighborhood clustering to identify partitions in the prediction space. Furthermore, we propose implicit feature augmentation and feature disentanglement as regularization loss functions that effectively utilize class semantic information within the feature space. These regularizers simulate the inclusion of an unlimited number of augmented target features into the augmentation graph while minimizing computational and memory demands. Our method shows superior adaptation performance in {SFDA} scenarios, including 2D image and 3D point cloud datasets and a highly imbalanced dataset.},

Past attempts have been restricted to the case of fully-connected, convolutional, and residual networks. This paper presents a systematic approach for fusing two or more transformer-based networks exploiting {O}ptimal {T}ransport to (soft-)align the various architectural components. We flesh out an abstraction for layer alignment, that can generalize to arbitrary architectures -- in principle -- and we apply this to the key ingredients of {T}ransformers such as multi-head self-attention, layer-normalization, and residual connections, and we discuss how to handle them via various ablation studies. Furthermore, our method allows the fusion of models of different sizes (heterogeneous fusion), providing a new and efficient way to compress {T}ransformers. The proposed approach is evaluated on both image classification tasks via {V}ision {T}ransformer and natural language modeling tasks using {BERT}. Our approach consistently outperforms vanilla fusion, and, after a surprisingly short finetuning, also outperforms the individual converged parent models. In our analysis, we uncover intriguing insights about the significant role of soft alignment in the case of {T}ransformers. Our results showcase the potential of fusing multiple {T}ransformers, thus compounding their expertise, in the budding paradigm of model fusion and recombination.},

To counteract this, we present an ensemble of critics to mitigate target variance. Moreover, we introduce a regularisation loss that helps to mitigate the effects that exploratory actions in one dimension can have on the value of optimal actions in other dimensions.

To overcome this problem, most recent work on {RTRL} focuses on approximation theories, while experiments are often limited to diagnostic settings. Here we explore the practical promise of {RTRL} in more realistic settings. We study actor-critic methods that combine {RTRL} and policy gradients, and test them in several subsets of {DMLab}-30, {ProcGen}, and {Atari}-2600 environments. On {DMLab} memory tasks, our system trained on fewer than 1.2B environmental frames is competitive with or outperforms well-known {IMPALA} and {R2D2} baselines trained on 10B frames. To scale to such challenging tasks, we focus on certain well-known neural architectures with element-wise recurrence, allowing for tractable {RTRL} without approximation. Importantly, we also discuss rarely addressed limitations of {RTRL} in real-world applications, such as its complexity in the multi-layer case.},

In the realm of text-conditioned image synthesis, the recent surge in progress has ushered in a collaborative era where users and {AI} systems coalesce to refine visual creations. This co-creative process in the landscape of online social networks empowers users to craft original visual artworks seeking for community validation. Nevertheless, assessing these models in the context of collective community preference introduces distinct challenges. Existing evaluation methods predominantly center on limited size user studies guided by image quality and alignment with prompts. This work pioneers a paradigm shift, unveiling Social Reward - an innovative reward modeling framework that leverages implicit feedback from social network users engaged in creative editing of generated images. We embark on an extensive journey of dataset curation and refinement, drawing from {P}icsart: an online visual creation and editing platform, yielding a first million-user-scale dataset of implicit human preferences for user-generated visual art named {P}icsart Image-Social. Our analysis exposes the shortcomings of current metrics in modeling community creative preference of text-to-image models' outputs, compelling us to introduce a novel predictive model explicitly tailored to address these limitations. Rigorous quantitative experiments and user study show that our Social Reward model aligns better with social popularity than existing metrics. Furthermore, we utilize Social Reward to fine-tune text-to-image models, yielding images that are more favored by not only Social Reward, but also other established metrics. These findings highlight the relevance and effectiveness of Social Reward in assessing community appreciation for {AI}-generated artworks, establishing a closer alignment with users' creative goals: creating popular visual art.},

While they excel at recognizing common generic concepts, they still struggle on fine-grained entities which are rare, or even absent from the pre-training dataset. Hence, a key ingredient to their success has been the use of large-scale curated pre-training data aiming at expanding the set of concepts that they can memorize during the pre-training stage. In this work, we explore an alternative to encoding fine-grained knowledge directly into the model's parameters: we instead train the model to retrieve this knowledge from an external memory. Specifically, we propose to equip existing vision-text models with the ability to refine their embedding with cross-modal retrieved information from a memory at inference time, which greatly improves their zero-shot predictions. Remarkably, we show that this can be done with a light-weight, single-layer, fusion transformer on top of a frozen {CLIP}. Our experiments validate that our retrieval-enhanced contrastive ({RECO}) training improves {CLIP} performance substantially on several challenging fine-grained tasks: for example +10.9 on {S}tanford Cars, +10.2 on {CUB}-2011 and +7.3 on the recent {OVEN} benchmark, where we even outperform the fine-tuned models on unseen classes.},

The CB layer and these loss terms are model agnostic, which we demonstrate by applying the CB layer to three different families of generative models: generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, and diffusion models.

To improve upon manually designed algorithms, the parameterization of this learned objective function must be expressive enough to represent novel principles of learning (instead of merely recovering already established ones) while still generalizing to a wide range of settings outside of its meta-training distribution. However, existing methods focus on discovering objective functions that, like many widely used objective functions in reinforcement learning, do not take into account the total number of steps allowed for training, or 'training horizon'. In contrast, humans use a plethora of different learning objectives across the course of acquiring a new ability. For instance, students may alter their studying techniques based on the proximity to exam deadlines and their self-assessed capabilities. This paper contends that ignoring the optimization time horizon significantly restricts the expressive potential of discovered learning algorithms. We propose a simple augmentation to two existing objective discovery approaches that allows the discovered algorithm to dynamically update its objective function throughout the agent's training procedure, resulting in expressive schedules and increased generalization across different training horizons. In the process, we find that commonly used meta-gradient approaches fail to discover such adaptive objective functions while evolution strategies discover highly dynamic learning rules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of tasks and analyze the resulting learned algorithms, which we find effectively balance exploration and exploitation by modifying the structure of their learning rules throughout the agent's lifetime.},

@inproceedings{jacob2024modeling,
  abstract = {We study the problem of modeling a population of agents pursuing unknown goals subject to unknown computational constraints. In standard models of bounded rationality, sub-optimal decision-making is simulated by adding homoscedastic noise to optimal decisions rather than actually simulating constrained inference. In this work, we introduce a latent inference budget model (L-IBM) that models these constraints explicitly, via a latent variable (inferred jointly with a model of agents' goals) that controls the runtime of an iterative inference algorithm. L-IBMs make it possible to learn agent models using data from diverse populations of suboptimal actors. In three modeling tasks---inferring navigation goals from routes, inferring communicative intents from human utterances, and predicting next moves in human chess games---we show that L-IBMs match or outperforms Boltzmann models of decision-making under uncertainty. Moreover, the inferred inference budgets are themselves meaningful, efficient to compute, and correlated with measures of player skill, partner skill and task difficulty.},

@inproceedings{jacob2024consensus,
  abstract = {When applied to question answering and other text generation tasks, language models (LMs) may be queried generatively (by sampling answers from their output distribution) or discriminatively (by using them to score or rank a set of candidate answers). These procedures sometimes yield very different predictions. How do we reconcile mutually incompatible scoring procedures to obtain coherent LM predictions? We introduce a new, a training-free, game-theoretic procedure for language model decoding. Our approach casts language model decoding as a regularized imperfect-information sequential signaling game---which we term the consensus game---in which a generator seeks to communicate an abstract correctness parameter using natural language sentences to a discriminator. We develop computational procedures for finding approximate equilibria of this game, resulting in a decoding algorithm we call equilibrium-ranking. Applied to a large number of tasks (including reading comprehension, commonsense reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, and assistive dialog), equilibrium-ranking consistently improves performance over existing LM decoding procedures. These improvements are sometimes substantial---on multiple benchmarks, we observe that applying equilibrium-ranking to LLaMA-7B outperforms the much larger LLaMA-65B and PaLM-540B models.},

  abstract = {Fine-tuning large pre-trained models has become the de facto strategy for developing both task-specific and general-purpose machine learning systems, including developing models that are safe to deploy. Despite its clear importance, there has been minimal work that explains how fine-tuning alters the underlying capabilities learned by a model during pretraining: does fine-tuning yield entirely novel capabilities or does it just modulate existing ones? We address this question empirically in synthetic, controlled settings where we can use mechanistic interpretability tools (e.g., network pruning and probing) to understand how the model's underlying capabilities are changing. We perform an extensive analysis of the effects of fine-tuning in these settings, and show that: (i) fine-tuning rarely alters the underlying model capabilities; (ii) a minimal transformation, which we call a 'wrapper', is typically learned on top of the underlying model capabilities, creating the illusion that they have been modified; and (iii) further fine-tuning on a task where such 'wrapped capabilities' are relevant leads to sample-efficient revival of the capability, i.e., the model begins reusing these capabilities after only a few gradient steps. This indicates that practitioners can unintentionally remove a model's safety wrapper merely by fine-tuning it on a, e.g., superficially unrelated, downstream task. We additionally perform analysis on language models trained on the TinyStories dataset to support our claims in a more realistic setup.},

  abstract = {Predictive uncertainty--a model's self-awareness regarding its accuracy on an input--is key for both building robust models via training interventions and for test-time applications such as selective classification. We propose a novel instance-conditional reweighting approach that captures predictive uncertainty using an auxiliary network, and unifies these train- and test-time applications. The auxiliary network is trained using a meta-objective in a bilevel optimization framework. A key contribution of our proposal is the meta-objective of minimizing dropout variance, an approximation of Bayesian predictive uncertainty. We show in controlled experiments that we effectively capture diverse specific notions of uncertainty through this meta-objective, while previous approaches only capture certain aspects. These results translate to significant gains in real-world settings--selective classification, label noise, domain adaptation, calibration--and across datasets--Imagenet, Cifar100, diabetic retinopathy, Camelyon, WILDs, Imagenet-C,-A,-R, Clothing-1.6M, etc. For Diabetic Retinopathy, we see upto 3.4\%/3.3\% accuracy \& AUC gains over SOTA in selective classification.

The majority of relevant studies have exclusively concentrated on increasing the quantity and functional correctness of training sets while disregarding other stylistic elements of programs. More recently, data quality has garnered a lot of interest and multiple works have showcased its importance for improving performance. In this work, we investigate data quality for code and find that making the code more structured and readable leads to improved code generation performance of the system. We build a novel data-cleaning pipeline that uses these principles to transform existing programs by 1.) renaming variables, 2.) modularizing and decomposing complex code into smaller helper sub-functions, and 3.) inserting natural-language based plans via {LLM} based transformations. We evaluate our approach on two challenging algorithmic code generation benchmarks and find that fine-tuning {C}ode{LL}a{M}a-7B on our transformed modularized programs improves the performance by up to 30\% compared to fine-tuning on the original dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate improved performance from using a smaller amount of higher-quality data, finding that a model fine-tuned on the entire original dataset is outperformed by a model trained on 15\% of our cleaned dataset. Even in comparison to closed-source models, our models outperform the much larger {A}lpha{C}oder models.},

Recently, several works have shown significant success in training-free and data-free compression (pruning and quantization) of {LLM}s that achieve 50--60\% sparsity and reduce the bit width to 3 or 4 bits per weight, with negligible degradation of perplexity over the uncompressed baseline. As recent research efforts are focused on developing increasingly sophisticated compression methods, our work takes a step back and re-evaluates the effectiveness of existing {SOTA} compression methods, which rely on a fairly simple and widely questioned metric, perplexity (even for dense {LLM}s). We introduce Knowledge-Intensive Compressed {LLM} {B}ench{M}ar{K} ({LLM}-{KICK}), a collection of carefully curated tasks to redefine the evaluation protocol for compressed {LLM}s, which have significant alignment with their dense counterparts and perplexity fail to capture subtle change in their true capabilities. {LLM}-{KICK} unveils many favorable merits and unfortunate plights of current {SOTA} compression methods: all pruning methods suffer significant performance degradation, sometimes at trivial sparsity ratios (e.g., 25--30\%), and fail for {N:M} sparsity in knowledge-intensive tasks; current quantization methods are more successful than pruning; yet, pruned {LLM}s even at $\geq$ 50\% sparsity are robust in-context retrieval and summarization systems; among others. {LLM}-{KICK} is designed to holistically access compressed {LLM}s' ability for language understanding, reasoning, generation, in-context retrieval, in-context summarization, etc. We hope our study can foster the development of better {LLM} compression methods.},

In particular, we focus on improving {GF}low{N}et with partial inference: training flow functions with the evaluation of the intermediate states or transitions. To this end, the recently developed forward-looking {GF}low{N}et reparameterizes the flow functions based on evaluating the energy of intermediate states. However, such an evaluation of intermediate energies may (i) be too expensive or impossible to evaluate and (ii) even provide misleading training signals under large energy fluctuations along the sequence of actions. To resolve this issue, we propose learning energy decompositions for {GF}low{N}ets ({LED}-{GFN}). Our main idea is to (i) decompose the energy of an object into learnable potential functions defined on state transitions and (ii) reparameterize the flow functions using the potential functions. In particular, to produce informative local credits, we propose to regularize the potential to change smoothly over the sequence of actions. It is also noteworthy that training {GF}low{N}et with our learned potential can preserve the optimal policy. We empirically verify the superiority of {LED}-{GFN} in five problems including the generation of unstructured and maximum independent sets, molecular graphs, and {RNA} sequences.},

In this work, we focus on computational fluid dynamics and address the shortcomings of a large part of the literature, which are based on fixed support for computations and predictions in the form of regular or irregular grids. We propose a novel setup to perform predictions in a continuous spatial and temporal domain while being trained on sparse observations. We formulate the task as a double observation problem and propose a solution with two interlinked dynamical systems defined on, respectively, the sparse positions and the continuous domain, which allows to forecast and interpolate a solution from the initial condition. Our practical implementation involves recurrent {GNN}s and a spatio-temporal attention observer capable of interpolating the solution at arbitrary locations. Our model not only generalizes to new initial conditions (as standard auto-regressive models do) but also performs evaluation at arbitrary space and time locations.

@inproceedings{javanmard2024learning,
  abstract = {Due to the rise of privacy concerns, in many practical applications the training data is aggregated before being shared with the learner, in order to protect privacy of users' sensitive responses. In an aggregate learning framework, the dataset is grouped into bags of samples, where each bag is available only with an aggregate response, providing a summary of individuals' responses in that bag. In this paper, we study two natural loss functions for learning from aggregate responses: bag-level loss and the instance-level loss. In the former, the model is learnt by minimizing a loss between aggregate responses and aggregate model predictions, while in the latter the model aims to fit individual predictions to the aggregate responses. In this work, we show that the instance-level loss can be perceived as a regularized form of the bag-level loss. This observation lets us compare the two approaches with respect to bias and variance of the resulting estimators, and introduce a novel interpolating estimator which combines the two approaches. For linear regression tasks, we provide a precise characterization of the risk of the interpolating estimator in an asymptotic regime where the size of the training set grows in proportion to the features dimension. Our analysis allows us to theoretically understand the effect of different factors, such as bag size on the model prediction risk. In addition, we propose a mechanism for differentially private learning from aggregate responses and derive the optimal bag size in terms of prediction risk-privacy trade-off. We also carry out thorough experiments to corroborate our theory and show the efficacy of the interpolating estimator.},

However, designing Input Mixup for node classification is challenging due to the irregularity issue that each node contains a different number of neighboring nodes for input and the alignment issue that how to align and interpolate two sets of neighboring nodes is not well-defined when two nodes are interpolated. We propose {iGraphMix}, a novel mixup method that generates virtual nodes and their edges by interpolating input features and labels, and attaching sampled neighboring nodes. {iGraphMix} focuses on mixing the features and connections of labeled nodes on the input graph to improve the model's classification ability and robustness.},

However, when confronted with the complexities of multi-attribute editing scenarios, they exhibit shortcomings such as omitting or overlooking intended attribute changes, modifying the wrong elements of the input video, and failing to preserve regions of the input video that should remain intact. We introduce {Ground-A-Video}, a novel grounding-guided video-to-video translation framework for multi-attribute video editing. Central to the method is the introduction of cross-frame gated attention which incorporates groundings information into the latent representations in a temporally consistent fashion, along with Modulated Cross-Attention and optical flow guided inverted latents smoothing.

In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively by proposing the first horizon-free policy search algorithm called {HF-O²PS} (Horizon-Free Occupancy-Measure Guided Optimistic Policy Search). To tackle the challenges caused by exploration and adversarially chosen reward, our algorithm employs (1) a variance-uncertainty-aware weighted least square estimator for the transition kernel; and (2) an occupancy measure-based technique for the online search of a stochastic policy.

Meanwhile, current reinforcement learning methods commonly rely on numerous environment interactions but hardly obtain generalizable policies. In this paper, we introduce the idea of rehearsal into policy optimization, where the agent plans for all possible outcomes in mind and acts adaptively according to actual responses from the environment. To effectively rehearse, we propose {ReDM}, an algorithm that generates a diverse and eligible set of dynamics models and then rehearse the policy via adaptive training on the generated model set. Rehearsal enables the policy to make decision plans for various hypothetical dynamics and to naturally generalize to previously unseen environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that {ReDM} is capable of learning a valid policy solely through rehearsal, even with zero interaction data. We further extend {ReDM} to scenarios where limited or mismatched interaction data is available, and our experimental results reveal that {ReDM} produces high-performing policies compared to other offline {RL} baselines.},

Specifically, we propose a Cascade {DyNeRF} to facilitate stable convergence and temporal continuity under the supervision signal which is discrete along the time axis.

In this work, we empirically show that diversity is critical in sampling outliers for {OOD} detection performance.

Since training {SNN}s from scratch is costly and has limited performance, converting pretrained artificial neural networks ({ANN}s) to {SNN}s is an attractive approach that retains robust performance without additional training data and resources. However, while existing conversion methods work well on convolution networks, emerging Transformer models introduce unique mechanisms like self-attention and test-time normalization, leading to non-causal non-linear interactions unachievable by current {SNN}s. To address this, we approximate these operations in both temporal and spatial dimensions, thereby providing the first {SNN} conversion pipeline for Transformers. We propose Universal Group Operators to approximate non-linear operations spatially and a Temporal-Corrective Self-Attention Layer that approximates spike multiplications at inference through an estimation-correction approach. Our algorithm is implemented on a pretrained {ViT}-{B}/32 from {CLIP}, inheriting its zero-shot classification capabilities, while improving control over conversion losses.

While recent studies have made notable progress in mitigating heterogeneity associated with label distributions, the issue of effectively handling feature heterogeneity remains an open question. In this paper, we propose a personalization approach by Local-global updates Mixing (LG-Mix) via Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based convergence. The core idea is to leverage the convergence rate induced by NTK to quantify the importance of local and global updates, and subsequently mix these updates based on their importance. Specifically, we find the trace of the NTK matrix can manifest the convergence rate, and propose an efficient and effective approximation to calculate the trace of a feature matrix instead of the NTK matrix. Such approximation significantly reduces the cost of computing NTK, and the feature matrix explicitly considers the heterogeneous features among samples. We have theoretically analyzed the convergence of our method in the over-parameterize regime, and experimentally evaluated our method on five datasets. These datasets present heterogeneous data features in natural and medical images. With comprehensive comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches, our LG-Mix has consistently outperformed them across all datasets (largest accuracy improvement of 5.01\%), demonstrating the outstanding efficacy of the proposed method for model personalization.},

Our method extracts knowledge from large language models (LLMs) and external biomedical KGs to build patient-specific KGs, which are then used to train our proposed Bi-attention AugmenTed (BAT) graph neural network (GNN) for healthcare predictions. On two public datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, GraphCare surpasses baselines in four vital healthcare prediction tasks: mortality, readmission, length of stay (LOS), and drug recommendation. On MIMIC-III, it boosts AUROC by 17.6\% and 6.6\% for mortality and readmission, and F1-score by 7.9\% and 10.8\% for LOS and drug recommendation, respectively. Notably, GraphCare demonstrates a substantial edge in scenarios with limited data availability. Our findings highlight the potential of using external KGs in healthcare prediction tasks and demonstrate the promise of GraphCare in generating personalized KGs for promoting personalized medicine.},

  abstract = {The training method of Spiking Neural Networks ({SNNs}) is an essential problem, and how to integrate local and global learning is a worthy research interest. However, the current integration methods do not consider the network conditions suitable for local and global learning, and thus fail to balance their advantages. In this paper, we propose an Excitation-Inhibition Mechanism-assisted Hybrid Learning ({EIHL}) algorithm that adjusts the network connectivity by using the excitation-inhibition mechanism and then switches between local and global learning according to the network connectivity. The experimental results on {CIFAR-10/100} and {DVS-CIFAR-10} demonstrate that the {EIHL} not only has better accuracy performance than other methods but also has excellent sparsity advantage. Especially, the Spiking {VGG-11} is trained by {EIHL}, {STBP}, and {STDP} on {DVS-CIFAR-10}, respectively. The accuracy of the Spiking {VGG-11} model on {EIHL} is 62.45\%, which is 4.35\% higher than {STBP} and 11.40\% higher than {STDP}, and the sparsity is 18.74\%, which is 18.74\% higher than the other two methods. Moreover, the excitation-inhibition mechanism used in our method also offers a new perspective on the field of {SNN} learning.},

  abstract = {Humanoid control is an important research challenge offering avenues for integration into human-centric infrastructures and enabling physics-driven humanoid animations. The daunting challenges in this field stem from the difficulty of optimizing in high-dimensional action spaces and the instability introduced by the bipedal morphology of humanoids. However, the extensive collection of human motion-captured data and the derived datasets of humanoid trajectories, such as {MoCapAct}, paves the way to tackle these challenges. In this context, we present Humanoid Generalist Autoencoding Planner ({H-GAP}), a state-action trajectory generative model trained on humanoid trajectories derived from human motion-captured data, capable of adeptly handling downstream control tasks with Model Predictive Control ({MPC}). For 56 degrees of freedom humanoid, we empirically demonstrate that {H-GAP} learns to represent and generate a wide range of motor behaviors. Further, without any learning from online interactions, it can also flexibly transfer these behaviours to solve novel downstream control tasks via planning. Notably, {H-GAP} excels established {MPC} baselines with access to the ground truth model, and is superior or comparable to offline {RL} methods trained for individual tasks. Finally, we do a series of empirical studies on the scaling properties of {H-GAP}, showing the potential for performance gains via additional data but not computing.},

  abstract = {Federated Domain Adaptation (FDA) describes the federated learning (FL) setting where source clients and a server work collaboratively to improve the performance of a target client where limited data is available. The domain shift between the source and target domains, coupled with limited data of the target client, makes FDA a challenging problem, e.g., common techniques such as federated averaging and fine-tuning fail due to domain shift and data scarcity. To theoretically understand the problem, we introduce new metrics that characterize the FDA setting and a theoretical framework with novel theorems for analyzing the performance of server aggregation rules. Further, we propose a novel lightweight aggregation rule, Federated Gradient Projection (FedGP), which significantly improves the target performance with domain shift and data scarcity. Moreover, our theory suggests an auto-weighting scheme that finds the optimal combinations of the source and target gradients. This scheme improves both FedGP and a simpler heuristic aggregation rule. Extensive experiments verify the theoretical insights and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in practice.},

  abstract = {The current electroencephalogram ({EEG}) based deep learning models are typically designed for specific datasets and applications in brain-computer interaction ({BCI}), limiting the scale of the models and thus diminishing their perceptual capabilities and generalizability. Recently, Large Language Models ({LLMs}) have achieved unprecedented success in text processing, prompting us to explore the capabilities of Large {EEG} Models ({LEMs}). We hope that {LEMs} can break through the limitations of different task types of {EEG} datasets, and obtain universal perceptual capabilities of {EEG} signals through unsupervised pre-training. Then the models can be fine-tuned for different downstream tasks. However, compared to text data, the volume of {EEG} datasets is generally small and the format varies widely. For example, there can be mismatched numbers of electrodes, unequal length data samples, varied task designs, and low signal-to-noise ratio. To overcome these challenges, we propose a unified foundation model for {EEG} called Large Brain Model ({LaBraM}). {LaBraM} enables cross-dataset learning by segmenting the {EEG} signals into {EEG} channel patches. Vector-quantized neural spectrum prediction is used to train a semantically rich neural tokenizer that encodes continuous raw {EEG} channel patches into compact neural codes. We then pre-train neural Transformers by predicting the original neural codes for the masked {EEG} channel patches. The {LaBraMs} were pre-trained on about 2,500 hours of various types of {EEG} signals from around 20 datasets and validated on multiple different types of downstream tasks.},

  abstract = {Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are attracting growing interest for their energy-efficient computing when implemented on neuromorphic hardware. However, directly training SNNs, even adopting batch normalization (BN), is highly challenging due to their non-differentiable activation function and the temporally delayed accumulation of outputs over time. For SNN training, this temporal accumulation gives rise to Temporal Covariate Shifts (TCS) along the temporal dimension, a phenomenon that would become increasingly pronounced with layer-wise computations across multiple layers and multiple time-steps. To address this issue, we propose a novel TAB (Temporal Accumulated Batch normalization) method that effectively encapsulates the historical temporal dependencies that underlie the membrane potential accumulation process, thereby establishing a natural connection between neuron dynamics and TAB batch normalization. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and DVS-CIFAR10 show that our TAB method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

While various learning-based approaches have been proposed for crystal generation, existing methods seldom consider the space group constraint which is crucial in describing the geometry of crystals and closely relevant to many desirable properties. However, considering space group constraint is challenging owing to its diverse and nontrivial forms. In this paper, we reduce the space group constraint into an equivalent formulation that is more tractable to be handcrafted into the generation process. In particular, we translate the space group constraint into two parts: the basis constraint of the invariant logarithmic space of the lattice matrix and the {Wyckoff} position constraint of the fractional coordinates. Upon the derived constraints, we then propose {DiffCSP++}, a novel diffusion model that has enhanced a previous work {DiffCSP} by further taking space group constraint into account. Experiments on several popular datasets verify the benefit of the involvement of the space group constraint, and show that our {DiffCSP++} achieves promising performance on crystal structure prediction, ab initio crystal generation and controllable generation with customized space groups.},

  abstract = {Deep implicit functions (DIFs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for many computer vision tasks such as 3D shape reconstruction, generation, registration, completion, editing, and understanding. However, given a set of 3D shapes with associated covariates there is at present no shape representation method which allows to precisely represent the shapes while capturing the individual dependencies on each covariate. Such a method would be of high utility to researchers to discover knowledge hidden in a population of shapes. For scientific shape discovery, we propose a 3D Neural Additive Model for Interpretable Shape Representation (NAISR) which describes individual shapes by deforming a shape atlas in accordance to the effect of disentangled covariates. Our approach captures shape population trends and allows for patient-specific predictions through shape transfer. NAISR is the first approach to combine the benefits of deep implicit shape representations with an atlas deforming according to specified covariates. We evaluate NAISR with respect to shape reconstruction, shape disentanglement, shape evolution, and shape transfer on three datasets: 1) Starman, a simulated 2D shape dataset; 2) the ADNI hippocampus 3D shape dataset; and 3) a pediatric airway 3D shape dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that NAISR achieves excellent shape reconstruction performance while retaining interpretability.},

While the field of {C}ausal{NLP} has attracted much interest in the recent years, existing causal inference datasets in {NLP} primarily rely on discovering causality from empirical knowledge (e.g., commonsense knowledge). In this work, we propose the first benchmark dataset to test the pure causal inference skills of large language models ({LLM}s). Specifically, we formulate a novel task {C}orr2{C}ause, which takes a set of correlational statements and determines the causal relationship between the variables. We curate a large-scale dataset of more than 200K samples, on which we evaluate seventeen existing {LLM}s. Through our experiments, we identify a key shortcoming of {LLM}s in terms of their causal inference skills, and show that these models achieve almost close to random performance on the task. This shortcoming is somewhat mitigated when we try to re-purpose {LLM}s for this skill via finetuning, but we find that these models still fail to generalize -- they can only perform causal inference in in-distribution settings when variable names and textual expressions used in the queries are similar to those in the training set, but fail in out-of-distribution settings generated by perturbing these queries. {C}orr2{C}ause is a challenging task for {LLM}s, and can be helpful in guiding future research on improving {LLM}s' pure reasoning skills and generalizability.},

@inproceedings{jin2024unified,

However, the prevailing approaches primarily regard the visual input as a prompt and focus exclusively on optimizing the text generation process conditioned upon vision content by a frozen {LLM}. Such an inequitable treatment of vision and language heavily constrains the model's potential. In this paper, we break through this limitation by representing both vision and language in a unified form. Specifically, we introduce a well-designed visual tokenizer to translate the non-linguistic image into a sequence of discrete tokens like a foreign language that {LLM} can read. The resulting visual tokens encompass high-level semantics worthy of a word and also support dynamic sequence length varying from the image. Coped with this tokenizer, the presented foundation model called {L}a{VIT} can handle both image and text indiscriminately under the same generative learning paradigm. This unification empowers {L}a{VIT} to serve as an impressive generalist interface to understand and generate multi-modal content simultaneously. Extensive experiments further showcase that it outperforms the existing models by a large margin on massive vision-language tasks.},

  abstract = {How does scaling the number of parameters in large language models ({LLM}s) affect their core capabilities? We study two natural scaling techniques -- weight pruning and simply training a smaller or larger model, which we refer to as dense scaling -- and their effects on two core capabilities of {LLM}s: (a) recalling facts presented during pre-training and (b) processing information presented in-context during inference. By curating a suite of tasks that help disentangle these two capabilities, we find a striking difference in how these two abilities evolve due to scaling. Reducing the model size by more than 30\% (via either scaling approach) significantly decreases the ability to recall facts seen in pre-training. Yet, a 60--70\% reduction largely preserves the various ways the model can process in-context information, ranging from retrieving answers from a long context to learning parameterized functions from in-context exemplars. The fact that both dense scaling and weight pruning exhibit this behavior suggests that scaling model size has an inherently disparate effect on fact recall and in-context learning.},

To this end, we formalize an Offline Opponent Modeling ({OOM}) problem with the objective of utilizing pre-collected offline datasets to learn opponent models that characterize the opponent from the viewpoint of the controlled agent, which aids in adapting to the unknown fixed policies of the opponent. Drawing on the promises of the Transformers for decision-making, we introduce a general approach, Transformer Against Opponent ({TAO}), for {OOM}. Essentially, {TAO} tackles the problem by harnessing the full potential of the supervised pre-trained Transformers' in-context learning capabilities. The foundation of {TAO} lies in three stages: an innovative offline policy embedding learning stage, an offline opponent-aware response policy training stage, and a deployment stage for opponent adaptation with in-context learning. Theoretical analysis establishes {TAO}'s equivalence to Bayesian posterior sampling in opponent modeling and guarantees {TAO}'s convergence in opponent policy recognition. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on competitive environments with sparse and dense rewards demonstrate the impressive performance of {TAO}. Our approach manifests remarkable prowess for fast adaptation, especially in the face of unseen opponent policies, confirming its in-context learning potency.},

@inproceedings{johnson2024sampleefficiency,
  abstract = {We theoretically explore the relationship between sample-efficiency and adaptivity in reinforcement learning. An algorithm is sample-efficient if it uses a number of queries $n$ to the environment that is polynomial in the dimension $d$ of the problem. Adaptivity refers to the frequency at which queries are sent and feedback is processed to update the querying strategy. To investigate this interplay, we employ a learning framework that allows sending queries in $K$ batches, with feedback being processed and queries updated after each batch. This model encompasses the whole adaptivity spectrum, ranging from non-adaptive `offline' ($K=1$) to fully adaptive ($K=n$) scenarios, and regimes in between. For the problems of policy evaluation and best-policy identification under $d$-dimensional linear function approximation, we establish $\Omega(\log \log d)$ lower bounds on the number of batches $K$ required for sample-efficient algorithms with $n = O(poly(d))$ queries. Our results show that just having adaptivity ($K>1$) does not necessarily guarantee sample-efficiency. Notably, the adaptivity-boundary for sample-efficiency is not between offline reinforcement learning ($K=1$), where sample-efficiency was known to not be possible, and adaptive settings. Instead, the boundary lies between different regimes of adaptivity and depends on the problem dimension.},

These impressive capabilities seem to imply an escape from the curse of dimensionality, but recent reports of memorization of the training set raise the question of whether these networks are learning the `true' continuous density of the data. To investigate this question, we study training of score-based diffusion models and examine the learned score functions. We show that two {DNN}s trained on non-overlapping subsets of a dataset learn nearly identical score functions, and that the diffusion-generated images are distinct from the training set. This suggests that the networks are learning the `true' score of the underlying continuous distribution. We provide evidence that this generalization behavior is connected to an inductive bias that favors geometry-adaptive harmonic representations.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty estimation is an essential and heavily-studied component for the reliable application of semantic segmentation methods. While various studies exist claiming methodological advances on the one hand, and successful application on the other hand, the field is currently hampered by a gap between theory and practice leaving fundamental questions unanswered: Can data-related and model-related uncertainty really be separated in practice? Which components of an uncertainty method are essential for real-world performance? Which uncertainty method works well for which application? In this work, we link this research gap to a lack of systematic and comprehensive evaluation of uncertainty methods. Specifically, we identify three key pitfalls in current literature and present an evaluation framework that bridges the research gap by providing: (1) A controlled environment for studying data ambiguities as well as distribution shifts (2) Systematic ablations of relevant method components (3) Test-beds for the five predominant uncertainty applications: {OoD}-detection, active learning, failure detection, calibration, and ambiguity modeling. Empirical results on simulated as well as real-world data demonstrate that: (1) Separation of uncertainty types works on simulated data but does not necessarily translate to real-world data (2) Aggregation of scores is a crucial but currently neglected component of uncertainty methods (3) While ensembles are performing most robustly across the different downstream tasks and settings, test-time augmentation often constitutes a light-weight alternative.},

As such, practitioners often turn to the use of similar but imperfect outlier data from which they might transfer information to the target outlier detection task. Despite the recent empirical success of transfer learning in outlier detection, a fundamental understanding of when and how knowledge can be transferred from a source to a target in outlier detection remains elusive. In this work, we adopt the traditional framework of {N}eyman-{P}earson classification---which formalizes supervised outlier detection, i.e., unbalanced classification---with the added assumption that we have access to both source and (some or no) target outlier data. Our main results are then as follows: We first determine the information-theoretic limits of the problem under a measure of discrepancy that extends some existing notions from traditional balanced classification; interestingly, unlike in balanced classification, seemingly very dissimilar sources can provide much information about a target, thus resulting in fast transfer. We then show that, in principle, these information-theoretic limits are achievable by adaptive procedures, i.e., procedures with no a priori information on the discrepancy between source and target distributions.},

Among the several changes we advocate for, we propose to synthesize variants of the training set images, obtained from generative text-to-image models, in order to automatically expand the training set towards a number of nameable variations that particularly hurt visual localization. After expanding the training set, we propose a training approach that leverages the specificities and the underlying geometry of this mix of real and synthetic data. We validate our approach on challenging visual localization benchmarks and report substantial improvements over baselines, with {SOTA} results on the challenging {C}yber{L}ocalization dataset.},

They can prevent erratic and harmful behaviors while being easier to implement and interpret. However, in practice, exploration is largely performed by stochastic policies. First-order {B}ayesian Optimization ({BO}) methods offer a principled way of performing exploration using deterministic policies. This is done through a learned probabilistic model of the objective function and its gradient. Nonetheless, such approaches treat policy search as a black-box problem, and thus, neglect the reinforcement learning nature of the problem. In this work, we leverage the performance difference lemma to introduce a novel mean function for the probabilistic model. We introduce a principled solution to this problem by building a novel {RL}-aware mean function to enhance local {BO} methods, leveraging the performance difference lemma to inject an action-value function into the {GP} prior of the objective function, thus effectively incorporating knowledge of past trajectories into their belief about the return of untested policies.},

  abstract = {Conformal prediction has shown spurring performance in constructing statistically rigorous prediction sets for arbitrary black-box machine learning models, assuming the data is exchangeable. However, even small adversarial perturbations during the inference can violate the exchangeability assumption, challenge the coverage guarantees, and result in a subsequent decline in empirical coverage. We propose a certifiably robust learning-reasoning conformal prediction framework (COLEP) via probabilistic circuits, which comprise a data-driven learning component that trains statistical models to learn different semantic concepts, and a reasoning component that encodes knowledge and characterizes the relationships among the trained models for logic reasoning. To achieve exact and efficient reasoning, we employ probabilistic circuits (PCs) within the reasoning component. Theoretically, we provide end-to-end certification of prediction coverage for COLEP in the presence of bounded adversarial perturbations. We also provide certified coverage considering the finite size of the calibration set. Furthermore, we prove that COLEP achieves higher prediction coverage and accuracy over a single model as long as the utilities of knowledge models are non-trivial. Empirically, we show the validity and tightness of our certified coverage, demonstrating the robust conformal prediction of COLEP on various datasets, including GTSRB, CIFAR10, and AwA2.},

The goal is to minimize the need for costly domain-specific data for subsequent fine-tuning while achieving desired performance levels. The key idea is to select data that nudges the pre-training distribution closer to the target distribution. We show the optimality of this approach for fine-tuning tasks under certain conditions. This differs from previous approaches that simply prioritize data that aligns with the target distribution. While this strategy may be effective when training a model from scratch, it can yield limited results when the model has already been pre-trained on a different distribution.},

@inproceedings{kang2024deep,
  abstract = {Conventional wisdom suggests that neural network predictions tend to be unpredictable and overconfident when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Our work reassesses this assumption for neural networks with high-dimensional inputs. Rather than extrapolating in arbitrary ways, we observe that neural network predictions often tend towards a constant value as input data becomes increasingly OOD. Moreover, we find that this value often closely approximates the optimal constant solution (OCS), i.e., the prediction that minimizes the average loss over the training data without observing the input. We present results showing this phenomenon across 8 datasets with different distributional shifts (including CIFAR10-C and ImageNet-R, S), different loss functions (cross entropy, MSE, and Gaussian NLL), and different architectures (CNNs and transformers). Furthermore, we present an explanation for this behavior, which we first validate empirically and then study theoretically in a simplified setting involving deep homogeneous networks with ReLU activations. Finally, we show how one can leverage our insights in practice to enable risk-sensitive decision-making in the presence of OOD inputs.},

@inproceedings{kang2024progressive,
  abstract = {Neural Implicit Representation (NIR) has recently gained significant attention due to its remarkable ability to encode complex and high-dimensional data into representation space and easily reconstruct it through a trainable mapping function. However, NIR methods assume a one-to-one mapping between the target data and representation models regardless of data relevancy or similarity. This results in poor generalization over multiple complex data and limits their efficiency and scalability. Motivated by continual learning, this work investigates how to accumulate and transfer neural implicit representations for multiple complex video data over sequential encoding sessions. To overcome the limitation of NIR, we propose a novel method, Progressive Fourier Neural Representation (PFNR), that aims to find an adaptive and compact sub-module in Fourier space to encode videos in each training session. This sparsified neural encoding allows the neural network to hold free weights, enabling an improved adaptation for future videos. In addition, when learning a representation for a new video, PFNR transfers the representation of previous videos with frozen weights. This design allows the model to continuously accumulate high-quality neural representations for multiple videos while ensuring lossless decoding that perfectly preserves the learned representations for previous videos. We validate our PFNR method on the UVG8/17 and DAVIS50 video sequence benchmarks and achieve impressive performance gains over strong continual learning baselines.},

Unlike traditional continuous GNNs that rely on integer-order differential equations, FROND employs the Caputo fractional derivative to leverage the non-local properties of fractional calculus. This approach enables the capture of long-term dependencies in feature updates, moving beyond the Markovian update mechanisms in conventional integer-order models and offering enhanced capabilities in graph representation learning. We offer an interpretation of the node feature updating process in FROND from a non-Markovian random walk perspective when the feature updating is particularly governed by a diffusion process. We demonstrate analytically that oversmoothing can be mitigated in this setting. Experimentally, we validate the FROND framework by comparing the fractional adaptations of various established integer-order continuous GNNs, demonstrating their consistently improved performance and underscoring the framework's potential as an effective extension to enhance traditional continuous GNNs.},

To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph generative network that captures the hierarchical nature of graphs and successively generates the graph sub-structures in a coarse-to-fine fashion. At each level of hierarchy, this model generates communities in parallel, followed by the prediction of cross-edges between communities using separate neural networks. This modular approach enables scalable graph generation for large and complex graphs. We model the output distribution of edges in the hierarchical graph with a multinomial distribution and derive a recursive factorization for this distribution. This enables us to generate community graphs with integer-valued edge weights in an autoregressive manner. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed generative model, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of graph quality across various benchmark datasets.},

@inproceedings{karlas2024data,
  abstract = {When a machine learning (ML) model exhibits poor quality (e.g., poor accuracy or fairness), the problem can often be traced back to errors in the training data. Being able to discover the data examples that are the most likely culprits is a fundamental concern that has received a lot of attention recently. One prominent way to measure 'data importance' with respect to model quality is the Shapley value. Unfortunately, existing methods only focus on the ML model in isolation, without considering the broader ML pipeline for data preparation and feature extraction, which appears in the majority of real-world ML code. This presents a major limitation to applying existing methods in practical settings. In this paper, we propose Datascope, a method for efficiently computing Shapley-based data importance over ML pipelines. We introduce several approximations that lead to dramatic improvements in terms of computational speed. Finally, our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our methods are capable of data error discovery that is as effective as existing Monte Carlo baselines, and in some cases even outperform them. We release our code as an open-source data debugging library available at https://github.com/easeml/datascope.},

A precise description of interactions between regions remains an open problem. Moreover, neural dynamics are nonlinear and non-stationary. Here, we propose MR-SDS, a multiregion, switching nonlinear state space model that decomposes global dynamics into local and cross-communication components in the latent space. MR-SDS includes directed interactions between brain regions, allowing for estimation of state-dependent communication signals, and accounts for sensory inputs effects. We show that our model accurately recovers latent trajectories, vector fields underlying switching nonlinear dynamics, and cross-region communication profiles in three simulations. We then apply our method to two large-scale, multi-region neural datasets involving mouse decision making. The first includes hundreds of neurons per region, recorded simultaneously at single-cell-resolution across 3 distant cortical regions. The second is a mesoscale widefield dataset of 8 adjacent cortical regions imaged across both hemispheres. On these multi-region datasets, our model outperforms existing piece-wise linear multi-region models and reveals multiple distinct dynamical states and a rich set of cross-region communication profiles.},

  abstract = {Given an image and a target modification (e.g an image of the Eiffel tower and the text 'without people and at night-time'), Compositional Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve the relevant target image in a database. While supervised approaches rely on annotating triplets that is costly (i.e. query image, textual modification, and target image), recent research sidesteps this need by using large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), performing Zero-Shot CIR (ZS-CIR). However, state-of-the-art approaches in ZS-CIR still require training task-specific, customized models over large amounts of image-text pairs. In this work, we propose to tackle CIR in a training-free manner via our Compositional Image Retrieval through Vision-by-Language (CIReVL), a simple, yet human-understandable and scalable pipeline that effectively recombines large-scale VLMs with large language models (LLMs). By captioning the reference image using a pre-trained generative VLM and asking a LLM to recompose the caption based on the textual target modification for subsequent retrieval via e.g. CLIP, we achieve modular language reasoning. In four ZS-CIR benchmarks, we find competitive, in-part state-of-the-art performance - improving over supervised methods Moreover, the modularity of CIReVL offers simple scalability without re-training, allowing us to both investigate scaling laws and bottlenecks for ZS-CIR while easily scaling up to in parts more than double of previously reported results. Finally, we show that CIReVL makes CIR human-understandable by composing image and text in a modular fashion in the language domain, thereby making it intervenable, allowing to post-hoc re-align failure cases},

As a result, it is often appropriate to think of the reward function as a proxy for the true objective rather than as its definition. We study this phenomenon through the lens of Goodhart's law, which predicts that increasing optimisation of an imperfect proxy beyond some critical point decreases performance on the true objective. We propose a way to quantify the magnitude of this effect and show empirically that optimising an imperfect proxy reward often leads to the behaviour predicted by Goodhart's law for a wide range of environments and reward functions. We provide a geometric explanation for why Goodhart's law occurs in Markov decision processes. We then use these theoretical insights to propose an optimal early stopping method that provably avoids the aforementioned pitfall and derive theoretical regret bounds for this method. We also derive a training method that maximises worst-case reward, for the setting where there is uncertainty about the true reward function. Finally, we empirically analyse the degree to which our theoretical results transfer to neural policy gradient algorithms.},

Building upon our interpretation, we propose a novel Noise-Free Score Distillation (NFSD) process, which requires minimal modifications to the original SDS framework. Through this streamlined design, we achieve more effective distillation of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models while using a nominal CFG scale.

  abstract = {We consider the problem of source-free unsupervised category-level pose estimation from only RGB images to a target domain without any access to source domain data or 3D annotations during adaptation. Collecting and annotating real-world 3D data and corresponding images is laborious, expensive, yet unavoidable process, since even 3D pose domain adaptation methods require 3D data in the target domain. We introduce 3DUDA, a method capable of adapting to a nuisance-ridden target domain without 3D or depth data. Our key insight stems from the observation that specific object subparts remain stable across out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios, enabling strategic utilization of these invariant subcomponents for effective model updates. We represent object categories as simple cuboid meshes, and harness a generative model of neural feature activations modeled at each mesh vertex learnt using differential rendering. We focus on individual locally robust mesh vertex features and iteratively update them based on their proximity to corresponding features in the target domain even when the global pose is not correct. Our model is then trained in an EM fashion, alternating between updating the vertex features and the feature extractor. We show that our method simulates fine-tuning on a global pseudo-labeled dataset under mild assumptions, which converges to the target domain asymptotically. Through extensive empirical validation, including a complex extreme UDA setup which combines real nuisances, synthetic noise, and occlusion, we demonstrate the potency of our simple approach in addressing the domain shift challenge and significantly improving pose estimation accuracy.},

Our key observation is that, while an image can be recognized in multiple ways, each has a consistent part-and-whole visual organization. Segmentation thus should be treated not as an end task to be mastered through supervised learning, but as an internal process that evolves with and supports the ultimate goal of recognition. We propose to integrate a hierarchical segmenter into the recognition process, train and adapt the entire model solely on image-level recognition objectives. We learn hierarchical segmentation for free alongside recognition, automatically uncovering part-to-whole relationships that not only underpin but also enhance recognition. Enhancing the Vision Transformer (ViT) with adaptive segment tokens and graph pooling, our model surpasses ViT in unsupervised part-whole discovery, semantic segmentation, image classification, and efficiency.

The key insight is to leverage local continuity in the environment dynamics to generate corrective labels. Our method first constructs a dynamics model from the expert demonstration, encouraging local Lipschitz continuity in the learned model. In locally continuous regions, this model allows us to generate corrective labels within the neighborhood of the demonstrations but beyond the actual set of states and actions in the dataset. Training on this augmented data enhances the agent's ability to recover from perturbations and deal with compounding errors.

  abstract = {Traveling waves of neural activity have been observed throughout the brain at a diversity of regions and scales; however, their precise computational role is still debated. One physically inspired hypothesis suggests that the cortical sheet may act like a wave-propagating system capable of invertibly storing a short-term memory of sequential stimuli through induced waves traveling across the cortical surface, and indeed many experimental results from neuroscience correlate wave activity with memory tasks. To date, however, the computational implications of this idea have remained hypothetical due to the lack of a simple recurrent neural network architecture capable of exhibiting such waves. In this work, we introduce a model to fill this gap, which we denote the Wave-RNN (wRNN), and demonstrate how such an architecture indeed efficiently encodes the recent past through a suite of synthetic memory tasks where wRNNs learn faster and reach significantly lower error than wave-free counterparts. We further explore the implications of this memory storage system on more complex sequence modeling tasks such as sequential image classification and find that wave-based models not only again outperform comparable wave-free RNNs while using significantly fewer parameters, but additionally perform comparably to more complex gated architectures such as LSTMs and GRUs.},

The extensive body of imbalanced approaches address categorical label spaces but fail to effectively extend to regression problems where the label space is continuous. Local and global correlations among continuous labels provide valuable insights towards effectively modelling relationships in feature space. In this work, we propose ConR, a contrastive regularizer that models global and local label similarities in feature space and prevents the features of minority samples from being collapsed into their majority neighbours. ConR discerns the disagreements between the label space and feature space and imposes a penalty on these disagreements. ConR addresses the continuous nature of label space with two main strategies in a contrastive manner: incorrect proximities are penalized proportionate to the label similarities and the correct ones are encouraged to model local similarities. ConR consolidates essential considerations into a generic, easy-to-integrate, and efficient method that effectively addresses deep imbalanced regression. Moreover, ConR is orthogonal to existing approaches and smoothly extends to uni- and multi-dimensional label spaces. Our comprehensive experiments show that ConR significantly boosts the performance of all the state-of-the-art methods on four large-scale deep imbalanced regression benchmarks.},

  abstract = {With the ever-increasing popularity of pretrained Video-Language Models (VidLMs), there is a pressing need to develop robust evaluation methodologies that delve deeper into their visio-linguistic capabilities. To address this challenge, we present ViLMA (Video Language Model Assessment), a task-agnostic benchmark that places the assessment of fine-grained capabilities of these models on a firm footing. Task-based evaluations, while valuable, fail to capture the complexities and specific temporal aspects of moving images that VidLMs need to process. Through carefully curated counterfactuals, ViLMA offers a controlled evaluation suite that sheds light on the true potential of these models, as well as their performance gaps compared to human-level understanding. ViLMA also includes proficiency tests, which assess basic capabilities deemed essential to solving the main counterfactual tests. We show that current VidLMs' grounding abilities are no better than those of vision-language models which use static images. This is especially striking once the performance on proficiency tests is factored in. Our benchmark serves as a catalyst for future research on VidLMs, helping to highlight areas that still need to be explored.},

@inproceedings{khandelwal2024large,
  abstract = {Shannon and Weaver's seminal information theory divides communication into three levels: technical, semantic, and effectiveness. While the technical level deals with the accurate reconstruction of transmitted symbols, the semantic and effectiveness levels deal with the inferred meaning and its effect on the receiver. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their wide generalizability, make some progress towards the second level. However, LLMs and other communication models are not conventionally designed for predicting and optimizing communication for desired receiver behaviors and intents. As a result, the effectiveness level remains largely untouched by modern communication systems. In this paper, we introduce the receivers' 'behavior tokens,' such as shares, likes, clicks, purchases, and retweets, in the LLM's training corpora to optimize content for the receivers and predict their behaviors. Other than showing similar performance to LLMs on content understanding tasks, our trained models show generalization capabilities on the behavior dimension for behavior simulation, content simulation, behavior understanding, and behavior domain adaptation. We show results on all these capabilities using a wide range of tasks on three corpora. We call these models Large Content and Behavior Models (LCBMs). Further, to spur more research on LCBMs, we release our new Content Behavior Corpus (CBC), a repository containing communicator, message, and corresponding receiver behavior.},

Thus, we carry out an empirical investigation in a range of different settings (namely, architectures, datasets, label noise, and more) by exhausting the limits of the simplest and the most general lower and upper bounds. As a highlight of this investigation, we showcase a remarkable fidelity of the lower Lipschitz bound, identify a striking Double Descent trend in both upper and lower bounds to the Lipschitz and explain the intriguing effects of label noise on function smoothness and generalisation.},

Although convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) have exhibited remarkable success in this field, they are predicated upon the belief that noise follows established distributions, which restricts their practicality when dealing with real-world noise. To overcome this limitation, several efforts have been taken to collect noisy image datasets from the real world. Generative methods, employing techniques such as generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) and normalizing flows ({NFs}), have emerged as a solution for generating realistic noisy images.

@inproceedings{kim2024fixed,
  abstract = {Fixed classifiers in neural networks for classification problems have demonstrated cost efficiency and even outperformed learnable classifiers in some popular benchmarks when incorporating orthogonality. Despite these advantages, prior research has yet to investigate the training dynamics of fixed orthogonal classifiers on neural collapse, a recently clarified phenomenon that last-layer features converge to a specific form, called simplex ETF, in training classification models involving the post-zero-error phase. Ensuring this phenomenon is critical for obtaining global optimality in a layer-peeled model, potentially leading to enhanced performance in practice. However, fixed orthogonal classifiers cannot invoke neural collapse due to their geometric limitations. To overcome the limits, we analyze a zero-mean neural collapse considering the orthogonality in non-negative Euclidean space. Then, we propose a fixed non-negative orthogonal classifier that induces the optimal solution and maximizes the margin of an orthogonal layer-peeled model by satisfying the properties of zero-mean neural collapse. Building on this foundation, we exploit a feature dimension separation effect inherent in our classifier for further purposes: (1) enhances softmax masking by mitigating feature interference in continual learning and (2) tackles the limitations of mixup on the hypersphere in imbalanced learning. We conducted comprehensive experiments on various datasets and architectures and demonstrated significant performance improvements.},

Designing a generative SSL strategy for hypergraphs, however, is not straightforward. Questions remain with regard to its generative SSL task, connection to downstream tasks, and empirical properties of learned representations. In light of the promises and challenges, we propose a novel generative SSL strategy for hypergraphs. We first formulate a generative SSL task on hypergraphs, hyperedge filling, and highlight its theoretical connection to node classification. Based on the generative SSL task, we propose a hypergraph SSL method, HYPEBOY. HYPEBOY learns effective general-purpose hypergraph representations, outperforming 15 baseline methods across 11 benchmark datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first study on generative SSL on hypergraphs, and we demonstrate its theoretical and empirical strengths for hypergraph representation learning.},

However, the Gaussian tail often decays too quickly to effectively accommodate the encoded points, failing to preserve crucial structures hidden in the data. In this paper, we explore the use of heavy-tailed models to combat over-regularization. Drawing upon insights from information geometry, we propose $t^3$VAE, a modified VAE framework that incorporates Student's t-distributions for the prior, encoder, and decoder. This results in a joint model distribution of a power form which we argue can better fit real-world datasets. We derive a new objective by reformulating the evidence lower bound as joint optimization of KL divergence between two statistical manifolds and replacing with $\gamma$-power divergence, a natural alternative for power families. $t^3$VAE demonstrates superior generation of low-density regions when trained on heavy-tailed synthetic data. Furthermore, we show that $t^3$VAE significantly outperforms other models on CelebA and imbalanced CIFAR-100 datasets.},

This paper presents Instructive Decoding (ID), a simple yet effective approach that augments the efficacy of instruction-tuned models. Specifically, ID adjusts the logits for next-token prediction in a contrastive manner, utilizing predictions generated from a manipulated version of the original instruction, referred to as a noisy instruction. This noisy instruction aims to elicit responses that could diverge from the intended instruction yet remain plausible. We conduct experiments across a spectrum of such noisy instructions, ranging from those that insert semantic noise via random words to others like 'opposite' that elicit the deviated responses. Our approach achieves considerable performance gains across various instruction-tuned models and tasks without necessitating any additional parameter updates. Notably, utilizing 'opposite' as the noisy instruction in ID, which shows the maximum divergence from the original instruction, consistently produces the most significant performance gains across multiple models and tasks.},

@inproceedings{kim2024stream,
  abstract = {Image generative models have made significant progress in generating realistic and diverse images, supported by comprehensive guidance from various evaluation metrics. However, current video generative models struggle to generate even short video clips, with limited tools that provide insights for improvements. Current video evaluation metrics are simple adaptations of image metrics by switching the embeddings with video embedding networks, which may underestimate the unique characteristics of video. Our analysis reveals that the widely used Frechet Video Distance (FVD) has a stronger emphasis on the spatial aspect than the temporal naturalness of video and is inherently constrained by the input size of the embedding networks used, limiting it to 16 frames. Additionally, it demonstrates considerable instability and diverges from human evaluations. To address the limitations, we propose STREAM, a new video evaluation metric uniquely designed to independently evaluate spatial and temporal aspects. This feature allows comprehensive analysis and evaluation of video generative models from various perspectives, unconstrained by video length. We provide analytical and experimental evidence demonstrating that STREAM provides an effective evaluation tool for both visual and temporal quality of videos, offering insights into area of improvement for video generative models. To the best of our knowledge, STREAM is the first evaluation metric that can separately assess the temporal and spatial aspects of videos.},

@inproceedings{kim2024scalable,
  abstract = {In this research, we focus on the problem of learning monotonic neural networks, as preserving the monotonicity of a model with respect to a subset of inputs is crucial for practical applications across various domains. Although several methods have recently been proposed to address this problem, they have limitations such as not guaranteeing monotonicity in certain cases, requiring additional inference time, lacking scalability with increasing network size and number of monotonic inputs, and manipulating network weights during training. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but novel architecture of the partially connected network which incorporates a 'scalable monotonic hidden layer' comprising three units: the exponentiated unit, ReLU unit, and confluence unit. This allows for the repetitive integration of the scalable monotonic hidden layers without other structural constraints. Consequently, our method offers ease of implementation and rapid training through the conventional error-backpropagation algorithm. We accordingly term this method as Scalable Monotonic Neural Networks (SMNN). Numerical experiments demonstrated that our method achieved comparable prediction accuracy to the state-of-the-art approaches while effectively addressing the aforementioned weaknesses.},

@inproceedings{kim2024clamtts,
  abstract = {With the emergence of neural audio codecs, which encode multiple streams of discrete tokens from audio, large language models have recently gained attention as a promising approach for zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis. Despite the ongoing rush towards scaling paradigms, audio tokenization ironically amplifies the scalability challenge, stemming from its long sequence length and the complexity of modelling the multiple sequences. To mitigate these issues, we present CLaM-TTS that employs a probabilistic residual vector quantization to (1) achieve superior compression in the token length, and (2) allow a language model to generate multiple tokens at once, thereby eliminating the need for cascaded modeling to handle the number of token streams. Our experimental results demonstrate that CLaM-TTS is better than or comparable to state-of-the-art neural codec-based TTS models regarding naturalness, intelligibility, speaker similarity, and inference speed. In addition, we examine the impact of the pretraining extent of the language models and their text tokenization strategies on performances.},

@inproceedings{kim2024decision,
  abstract = {The recent success of Transformer in natural language processing has sparked its use in various domains. In offline reinforcement learning (RL), Decision Transformer (DT) is emerging as a promising model based on Transformer. However, we discovered that the attention module of DT is not appropriate to capture the inherent local dependence pattern in trajectories of RL modeled as a Markov decision process. To overcome the limitations of DT, we propose a novel action sequence predictor, named Decision ConvFormer (DC), based on the architecture of MetaFormer, which is a general structure to process multiple entities in parallel and understand the interrelationship among the multiple entities. DC employs local convolution filtering as the token mixer and can effectively capture the inherent local associations of the RL dataset. In extensive experiments, DC achieved state-of-the-art performance across various standard RL benchmarks while requiring fewer resources. Furthermore, we show that DC better understands the underlying meaning in data and exhibits enhanced generalization capability.},

To address this challenge, the authors propose a novel approach called Diffusion Bridge Network ({DBN}). Based on the theory of the {S}chrödinger bridge, this method directly learns to simulate a Stochastic Differential Equation ({SDE}) that connects the output distribution of a single ensemble member to the output distribution of the ensembled model, allowing them to obtain ensemble prediction without having to invoke forward passes for multiple models.},

The main idea is to explore the local neighborhood via backtracking and reconstruction guided by backward and forward policies, respectively.

Modeling the combinatorially large space of sequences is infeasible; prior methods often constrain optimization to a small mutational radius, but this drastically limits the design space. Instead of heuristics, we propose smoothing the fitness landscape to facilitate protein optimization. First, we formulate protein fitness as a graph signal then use Tikunov regularization to smooth the fitness landscape. We find optimizing in this smoothed landscape leads to improved performance across multiple methods in the GFP and AAV benchmarks. Second, we achieve state-of-the-art results utilizing discrete energy-based models and MCMC in the smoothed landscape.

We find that RLHF generalises better than SFT to new inputs, particularly as the distribution shift between train and test becomes larger. However, RLHF significantly reduces output diversity compared to SFT across a variety of measures, implying a tradeoff in current LLM fine-tuning methods between generalisation and diversity.},

Existing evaluation metrics for OPE estimators primarily focus on the 'accuracy' of OPE or that of downstream policy selection, neglecting risk-return tradeoff and efficiency in subsequent online policy deployment. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from portfolio evaluation in finance and develop a new metric, called SharpeRatio@k, which measures the risk-return tradeoff and efficiency of policy portfolios formed by an OPE estimator under varying online evaluation budgets. We conduct a benchmark experiment of various OPE estimators regarding their risk-return tradeoff, presenting several future directions for OPE research.},

Despite the radical differences between biological and artificial networks, critical learning periods have been empirically observed in both systems. This suggests that critical periods may be fundamental to learning and not an accident of biology. Yet, why exactly critical periods emerge in deep networks is still an open question. To isolate the key underlying factors, we focus on deep linear network models, and show that, surprisingly, such networks also display much of the behavior seen in biology and artificial networks, while being amenable to analytical treatment. We show that critical periods depend on the depth of the model and structure of the data distribution, and that the learning of features is tied to competition between sources.},

However, most of the existing methods are focused on classification tasks using images and language datasets. Therefore, in order to expand the transfer learning scheme to regression tasks, we propose a novel transfer technique based on differential geometry, namely the Geometrically Aligned Transfer Encoder ({GATE}). In this method, we interpret the latent vectors from the model to exist on a Riemannian curved manifold. We find a proper diffeomorphism between pairs of tasks to ensure that every arbitrary point maps to a locally flat coordinate in the overlapping region, allowing the transfer of knowledge from the source to the target data. This also serves as an effective regularizer for the model to behave in extrapolation regions. In this article, we demonstrate that {GATE} outperforms conventional methods and exhibits stable behavior in both the latent space and extrapolation regions for various molecular graph datasets.},

Our method leverages images as a task-agnostic representation, encoding both the state and action information, and text as a general representation for specifying robot goals. By synthesizing videos that 'hallucinate' robot executing actions and in combination with dense correspondences between frames, our approach can infer the closed-formed action to execute to an environment without the need of any explicit action labels. This unique capability allows us to train the policy solely based on {RGB} videos and deploy learned policies to various robotic tasks.

In seminal works, Hyvärinen proposed vanilla score matching as a way to learn distributions from data by computing an estimate of the score function of the underlying ground truth, and established connections between this method and established techniques like Contrastive Divergence and Pseudolikelihood estimation. It is by now well-known that vanilla score matching has significant difficulties learning multimodal distributions. Although there are various ways to overcome this difficulty, the following question has remained unanswered --- is there a natural way to sample multimodal distributions using just the vanilla score? Inspired by a long line of related experimental works, we prove that the Langevin diffusion with early stopping, initialized at the empirical distribution, and run on a score function estimated from data successfully generates natural multimodal distributions (mixtures of log-concave distributions).},

However, despite the importance of a protein's dynamical properties for its function, conditioning on dynamical properties remains elusive. We present a new approach to protein generative modeling by leveraging Normal Mode Analysis that enables us to capture dynamical properties too. We introduce a method for conditioning the diffusion probabilistic models on protein dynamics, specifically on the lowest non-trivial normal mode of oscillation. Our method, similar to the classifier guidance conditioning, formulates the sampling process as being driven by conditional and unconditional terms. However, unlike previous works, we approximate the conditional term with a simple analytical function rather than an external neural network, thus making the eigenvector calculations approachable. We present the corresponding {SDE} theory as a formal justification of our approach. We extend our framework to conditioning on structure and dynamics at the same time, enabling scaffolding of the dynamical motifs. We demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our method by turning the open-source unconditional protein diffusion model Genie into the conditional model with no retraining. Generated proteins exhibit the desired dynamical and structural properties while still being biologically plausible.},

We illuminate the fine-grained relationships learned by diffusion models by noticing a precise relationship between diffusion and information decomposition. Exact expressions for mutual information and conditional mutual information can be written in terms of the denoising model. Pointwise estimates can be easily estimated as well, allowing us to ask questions about the relationships between specific images and captions. For diffusion models, we show that a natural non-negative decomposition of mutual information emerges, allowing us to quantify informative relationships between words and pixels in an image. We exploit these new relations to measure the compositional understanding of diffusion models, to do unsupervised localization of objects in images, and to measure effects when selectively editing images through prompt interventions.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates discrepancies in how neural networks learn from different imaging domains, which are commonly overlooked when adopting computer vision techniques from the domain of natural images to other specialized domains such as medical images. Recent works have found that the generalization error of a trained network typically increases with the intrinsic dimension (d\_data) of its training set. Yet, the steepness of this relationship varies significantly between medical (radiological) and natural imaging domains, with no existing theoretical explanation. We address this gap in knowledge by establishing and empirically validating a generalization scaling law with respect to d\_data, and propose that the substantial scaling discrepancy between the two considered domains may be at least partially attributed to the higher intrinsic ``label sharpness'' (K\_F) of medical imaging datasets, a metric which we propose. Next, we demonstrate an additional benefit of measuring the label sharpness of a training set: it is negatively correlated with the trained model's adversarial robustness, which notably leads to models for medical images having a substantially higher vulnerability to adversarial attack. Finally, we extend our d\_data formalism to the related metric of learned representation intrinsic dimension (d\_repr), derive a generalization scaling law with respect to d\_repr, and show that d\_data serves as an upper bound for d\_repr. Our theoretical results are supported by thorough experiments with six models and eleven natural and medical imaging datasets over a range of training set sizes.},

@inproceedings{koohpayegani2024nola,
  abstract = {Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) and storing them for each downstream task or domain is impractical because of the massive model size (e.g., 350GB in GPT-3). Current literature, such as LoRA, showcases the potential of low-rank modifications to the original weights of an LLM, enabling efficient adaptation and storage for task-specific models. These methods can reduce the number of parameters needed to fine-tune an LLM by several orders of magnitude. Yet, these methods face two primary limitations: (1) the parameter count is lower-bounded by the rank one decomposition, and (2) the extent of reduction is heavily influenced by both the model architecture and the chosen rank. We introduce NOLA, which overcomes the rank one lower bound present in LoRA. It achieves this by re-parameterizing the low-rank matrices in LoRA using linear combinations of randomly generated matrices (basis) and optimizing the linear mixture coefficients only. This approach allows us to decouple the number of trainable parameters from both the choice of rank and the network architecture. We present adaptation results using GPT-2, LLaMA-2, and ViT in natural language and computer vision tasks. NOLA performs as well as LoRA models with much fewer number of parameters compared to LoRA with rank one, the best compression LoRA can archive. Particularly, on LLaMA-2 70B, our method is almost 20 times more compact than the most compressed LoRA without degradation in accuracy.},

In this work, we present Vector-based Random Matrix Adaptation (VeRA), which significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters compared to LoRA, yet maintains the same performance. It achieves this by using a single pair of low-rank matrices shared across all layers and learning small scaling vectors instead. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the GLUE and E2E benchmarks, image classification tasks, and show its application in instruction-tuning of 7B and 13B language models.},

  abstract = {The extraction of object-centric representations for downstream tasks is an emerging area of research. Learning grounded representations of objects that are guaranteed to be stable and invariant promises robust performance across different tasks and environments. Slot Attention (SA) learns object-centric representations by assigning objects to slots, but presupposes a single distribution from which all slots are randomly initialised. This results in an inability to learn specialized slots which bind to specific object types and remain invariant to identity-preserving changes in object appearance. We present Conditional Slot Attention (CoSA) using a novel concept of Grounded Slot Dictionary (GSD) inspired by vector quantization. The proposed GSD comprises (i) canonical object-level property vectors and (ii) parametric Gaussian distributions, which define a prior over the slots. Our approach enables learning grounded representations of objects that remain stable and invariant to changes in object appearance while providing interpretable slot attention mechanisms that can generalize to downstream tasks.},

  abstract = {Despite the recent advances in the field of computational Schr{\"o}dinger Bridges (SB), most existing SB solvers are still heavy-weighted and require complex optimization of several neural networks. It turns out that there is no principal solver which plays the role of simple-yet-effective baseline for SB just like, e.g., k-means method in clustering, logistic regression in classification or Sinkhorn algorithm in discrete optimal transport. We address this issue and propose a novel fast and simple SB solver. Our development is a smart combination of two ideas which recently appeared in the field: (a) parameterization of the Schr{\"o}dinger potentials with sum-exp quadratic functions and (b) viewing the log-Schr{\"o}dinger potentials as the energy functions. We show that combined together these ideas yield a lightweight, simulation-free and theoretically justified SB solver with a simple straightforward optimization objective. As a result, it allows solving SB in moderate dimensions in a matter of minutes on CPU without a painful hyperparameter selection. Our light solver resembles the Gaussian mixture model which is widely used for density estimation. Inspired by this similarity, we also prove an important theoretical result showing that our light solver is a universal approximator of SBs.},

Despite the inclusion of empirical evaluations in all the proposed algorithms, the interrogative aspects of these evaluations lack diversity. As a result, various facets of explainability pertaining to GNNs, such as a comparative analysis of counterfactual reasoners, their stability to variational factors such as different GNN architectures, noise, stochasticity in non-convex loss surfaces, feasibility amidst domain constraints, and so forth, have yet to be formally investigated. Motivated by this need, we present a benchmarking study on perturbation-based explainability methods for GNNs, aiming to systematically evaluate and compare a wide range of explainability techniques. Among the key findings of our study, we identify the Pareto-optimal methods that exhibit superior efficacy and stability in the presence of noise. However, we also identify several troubling trends such as the universal instability of counterfactual explainers when faced with noisy data and the general ineffectiveness of current explainers when faced with graph data which incorporates realistic domain-specific constraints.},

However, there is currently no consensus about how this in-context learning (ICL) ability of LLMs works. For example, while Xie et al. (2022) liken ICL to a general-purpose learning algorithm, Min et al. (2022) argue ICL does not even learn label relationships from in-context examples. In this paper, we provide novel insights into how ICL leverages label information, revealing both capabilities and limitations. To ensure we obtain a comprehensive picture of ICL behavior, we study probabilistic aspects of ICL predictions and thoroughly examine the dynamics of ICL as more examples are provided. Our experiments show that ICL predictions almost always depend on in-context labels and that ICL can learn truly novel tasks in-context. However, we also find that ICL struggles to fully overcome prediction preferences acquired from pre-training data and, further, that ICL does not consider all in-context information equally.},

This is instrumental to learning the transfer operator or the generator of the system, which in turn can be used for numerous tasks, such as forecasting and interpreting the system dynamics. We show that the search for a good representation can be cast as an optimization problem over neural networks. Our approach is supported by recent results in statistical learning theory, highlighting the role of approximation error and metric distortion in the learning problem. The objective function we propose is associated with projection operators from the representation space to the data space, overcomes metric distortion, and can be empirically estimated from data. In the discrete-time setting, we further derive a relaxed objective function that is differentiable and numerically well-conditioned. We compare our method against state-of-the-art approaches on different datasets, showing better performance across the board.},

In a simplified scenario, we demonstrate that improving performance on tasks within the fine-tuning data distribution comes at the expense of capabilities on other tasks. We hypothesize that language models implicitly infer the task of the prompt and that fine-tuning skews this inference towards tasks in the fine-tuning distribution. To test this, we propose Conjugate Prompting, which artificially makes the task look farther from the fine-tuning distribution while requiring the same capability, and we find that this recovers some of the pretraining capabilities in our synthetic setup. Since real-world fine-tuning distributions are predominantly English, we apply conjugate prompting to recover pretrained capabilities in LLMs by simply translating the prompts to different languages. This allows us to recover in-context learning abilities lost via instruction tuning, natural reasoning capability lost during code fine-tuning, and, more concerningly, harmful content generation suppressed by safety fine-tuning in chatbots like ChatGPT.},

As a result, they can assign predictions that are fixed -- meaning that individuals who are denied loans and interviews are, in fact, precluded from access to credit and employment. In this work, we introduce a procedure called recourse verification to test if a model assigns fixed predictions to its decision subjects. We propose a model-agnostic approach for verification with reachable sets -- i.e., the set of all points that a person can reach through their actions in feature space. We develop methods to construct reachable sets for discrete feature spaces, which can certify the responsiveness of any model by simply querying its predictions. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the infeasibility of recourse on datasets from consumer finance. Our results highlight how models can inadvertently preclude access by assigning fixed predictions and underscore the need to account for actionability in model development.},

The estimated pixel-wise uncertainty can not only be aggregated into a sample-wise metric to filter out low-fidelity images but also aids in augmenting successful generations and rectifying artifacts in failed generations in text-to-image tasks.

In this paper, we introduce ContextRef, a benchmark for assessing referenceless metrics for such alignment. ContextRef has two components: human ratings along a variety of established quality dimensions, and ten diverse robustness checks designed to uncover fundamental weaknesses. A crucial aspect of ContextRef is that images and descriptions are presented in context, reflecting prior work showing that context is important for description quality. Using ContextRef, we assess a variety of pretrained models, scoring functions, and techniques for incorporating context. None of the methods is successful with ContextRef, but we show that careful fine-tuning yields substantial improvements.

We develop a mathematical framework that outlines sufficient conditions for the emergence of neural reactivation in circuits that encode features of smoothly varying stimuli. We show that noisy recurrent networks optimized to track environmental state variables using change-based sensory information naturally develop denoising dynamics, which, in the absence of input, cause the network to revisit state configurations observed during periods of online activity. Our findings demonstrate that multiple interneuron types organized in a canonical excitatory-inhibitory circuit support offline reactivation. We validate our findings using numerical experiments on two canonical neuroscience tasks: spatial position estimation based on self-motion cues, and head direction estimation.},

This paper proposes ImagenHub, which is a one-stop library to standardize the inference and evaluation of all the conditional image generation models. Firstly, we define seven prominent tasks and curate high-quality evaluation datasets for them. Secondly, we built a unified inference pipeline to ensure fair comparison. Thirdly, we design two human evaluation scores, i.e. Semantic Consistency and Perceptual Quality, along with comprehensive guidelines to evaluate generated images. We train expert raters to evaluate the model outputs based on the proposed metrics. Our human evaluation achieves a high inter-worker agreement of Krippendorff's alpha on 76\% models with a value higher than 0.4. We comprehensively evaluated a total of around 30 models and observed three key takeaways: (1) the existing models' performance is generally unsatisfying except for Text-guided Image Generation and Subject-driven Image Generation, with 74\% models achieving an overall score lower than 0.5. (2) we examined the claims from published papers and found 83\% of them hold with a few exceptions. (3) None of the existing automatic metrics has a Spearman's correlation higher than 0.2 except subject-driven image generation.},

However, the high training and inference cost and limited interpretability of ML approaches severely limit their wide application to modern exact CO solvers. In contrast, human-designed policies -- though widely integrated in modern CO solvers due to their compactness and reliability -- cannot capture data-driven patterns for higher performance. In this paper, we show the potential existence of small symbolic policies and propose the first symbolic discovery framework called Deep Symbolic Optimization (DSO) for exact combinatorial optimization solver (Symb4CO) to learn high-performance symbolic policies on the branching task. Experiments show that the Symb4CO learned purely CPU-based policies consistently achieve comparable performance to previous GPU-based state-of-the-art approaches. The appealing features of Symb4CO include its high training efficiency (ten training instances), inference efficiency (one CPU core), and good interpretability (one-line expressions), making it simple and reliable for deployment.},

However, a theoretical understanding of how perturbations include class features and contribute to generalization is limited. In this study, we provide a theoretical framework for understanding learning from perturbations using a one-hidden-layer network trained on mutually orthogonal samples.

We examine this transition in a two-layer neural network trained on sparse parity, where we can understand the transition from lazy to rich training using recent advances in the theory of feature learning. We show that the emergence of grokking is caused by competition between feature learning and memorization, and that feature learning only occurs once the network's initial features become sufficiently aligned with the sparse parity task. We identify key factors that determine whether grokking occurs: the feature learning rate, the strength of initial feature-target alignment, and the degree of sparsity in the data. Our theory predicts novel ways to induce and control grokking behavior, which we validate empirically.},

@inproceedings{kumar2024how,
  abstract = {{SGD} and {AdamW} are the two most used optimizers for fine-tuning large neural networks in computer vision. When the two methods perform the same, {SGD} is preferable because it uses less memory (12 bytes/parameter with momentum and 8 bytes/parameter without) than {AdamW} (16 bytes/parameter). However, on a suite of downstream tasks, especially those with distribution shifts, we find that fine-tuning with {AdamW} performs substantially better than {SGD} on modern Vision Transformer and {ConvNeXt} models. We find that large gaps in performance between {SGD} and {AdamW} occur when the fine-tuning gradients in the first embedding layer are much larger than in the rest of the model. Our analysis suggests an easy fix that works consistently across datasets and models: freezing the embedding layer (less than 1\% of the parameters) leads to {SGD} with or without momentum performing slightly better than {AdamW} while using less memory (e.g., on {ViT-L}, {SGD} uses 33\% less {GPU} memory). Our insights result in state-of-the-art accuracies on five popular distribution shift benchmarks: {WILDS-FMoW}, {WILDS-Camelyon}, {BREEDS-Living-17}, Waterbirds, and {DomainNet}.},

As a first step, we study the landscape of {BO} through the lens of penalty methods, in which the upper- and lower-level objectives are combined in a weighted sum with penalty parameter $\sigma > 0$. In particular, we establish a strong connection between the penalty function and the hyper-objective by explicitly characterizing the conditions under which the values and derivatives of the two must be $O(\sigma)$-close. A by-product of our analysis is the explicit formula for the gradient of hyper-objective when the lower-level problem has multiple solutions under minimal conditions, which could be of independent interest. Next, viewing the penalty formulation as $O(\sigma)$-approximation of the original {BO}, we propose first-order algorithms that find an $\epsilon$-stationary solution by optimizing the penalty formulation with appropriate penalty parameters. When the perturbed lower-level problem uniformly satisfies the small-error proximal error-bound ({EB}) condition, we propose a first-order algorithm that converges to an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the penalty function. Under an additional assumption on stochastic oracles, we show that the algorithm can be implemented in a fully single-loop manner and achieves improved oracle-complexity.},

In this work, we present a new methodology for performing image clustering based on user-specified criteria in the form of text by leveraging modern Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models. We call our method Image Clustering Conditioned on Text Criteria ({IC|TC}), and it represents a different paradigm of image clustering. {IC|TC} requires a minimal and practical degree of human intervention and grants the user significant control over the clustering results in return. Our experiments show that {IC|TC} can effectively cluster images with various criteria, such as human action, physical location, or the person's mood, while significantly outperforming baselines.},

Instead of forcing corrupted image representations to cross the nearest decision boundaries or converge to a particular point, we propose a distribution-oriented approach that relies on optimal transport to push the feature distribution of attacked images towards an already modeled distribution. We show that this new approach leads to better transferable patches. Through digital experiments conducted on {ImageNet-1K}, we provide evidence that our new patches are the only ones that can simultaneously influence multiple target models.

  abstract = {Equilibrium propagation ({EP}) is a compelling alternative to the backpropagation of error algorithm ({BP}) for computing gradients of neural networks on biological or analog neuromorphic substrates. However, the algorithm requires weight symmetry and infinitesimal equilibrium perturbations, i.e., nudges, to estimate unbiased gradients efficiently, both of which are challenging to implement in physical systems. We study generalized {EP}, which can be formulated without weight symmetry, and analytically isolate the two sources of bias: the finite nudge amplitude and the {Jacobian} asymmetry. We found how finite nudge and non-symmetric weights induce distinct biases in the gradient estimate. While bias due to finite nudge is avoidable using holomorphic {EP}, weight asymmetry remains a significant obstacle by inducing non-normal {Jacobians}. We illustrate how both issues can be overcome through oscillations by combining holomorphic {EP} with a new form of {Jacobian} homeostasis that encourages functional symmetry, but without imposing strict weight symmetry. {Jacobian} homeostasis enables training of deep networks with untied weights on challenging tasks such as {ImageNet} 32×32 with minimal drop in accuracy compared to symmetric networks, thereby further strengthening the role of {EP} family algorithms for bio-plausible learning and neuromorphic engineering.},

The models allow inference of system behavior at any continuous time and generalize well beyond the data distributions seen during training. Furthermore, the models do not require an explicit neural {ODE} formulation, making them efficient and highly scalable in practice. The approach rests on a separation into an instance-specific encoding (capturing initial conditions, constants etc.) and a latent dynamics model that is itself universal across all instances/realizations of the system. We include extensive empirical experiments that investigate the ability to predict the trajectories of complicated systems based on finite data and show that the proposed approaches can outperform existing neural-dynamical models. The method focuses on learning dynamical systems from high-dimensional empirical data, specifically in the setting where data are available from multiple different instances of a system whose underlying dynamical model is entirely unknown at the outset.},

Existing attempts to quantify the statistical benefits of these biases in {CNNs} over locally connected convolutional neural networks ({LCNs}) and fully connected neural networks ({FCNs}) fall into one of the following categories: either they disregard the optimizer and only provide uniform convergence upper bounds with no separating lower bounds, or they consider simplistic tasks that do not truly mirror the locality and translation invariance as found in real-world vision tasks. To address these deficiencies, we introduce the Dynamic Signal Distribution ({DSD}) classification task that models an image as consisting of $k$ patches, each of dimension $d$, and the label is determined by a $d$-sparse signal vector that can freely appear in any one of the $k$ patches. We establish concrete sample complexity separations: for any orthogonally equivariant algorithm like gradient descent, {CNNs} require $\tilde{O}(k+d)$ samples, whereas {LCNs} require $\Omega(kd)$ samples, establishing the statistical advantages of weight sharing in translation invariant tasks. {LCNs} need $\tilde{O}(k(k+d))$ samples, compared to $\Omega(k^2d)$ samples for {FCNs}, showcasing the benefits of locality in local tasks.},

@inproceedings{lai2024memoryassisted,
  abstract = {Universal domain adaptation (UniDA) aims to align the class distributions and reduce the feature gap between source and target domains, where the target private category set is set unknown during adaptation. However, most existing methods overlook the intra-class structure within the same category, especially when there is significant concept shift between samples in the same category. When samples with large concept shift are forced to be pushed together, it may negatively affect the adaptation performance. From the perspective of interpretability, it is not reasonable to align the visual features with significant difference (e.g. fighter and civil aircraft) to the same category. Due to the semantic ambiguity and annotation cost, the categories are not always classified very carefully. This makes it difficult to adapt precisely. To address these issues, we propose a novel Memory-Assisted Sub-Prototype Mining (MemSPM) method, which can learn the difference between the samples belonging to the same category and mine sub-classes when there is significant concept shift between them. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in all three domain adaptation scenarios: UniDA, Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) and Partial Domain Adaptation (PDA).},

To address this issue of inherent instability, we introduce a formal definition for an alternative concept called the Faithful Vision-Language Concept (FVLC) model. We present a methodology for constructing an FVLC that satisfies four critical properties.

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) theory has largely focused on proving minimax sample complexity bounds. These require strategic exploration algorithms that use relatively limited function classes for representing the policy or value function. Our goal is to explain why deep RL algorithms often perform well in practice, despite using random exploration and much more expressive function classes like neural networks. Our work arrives at an explanation by showing that many stochastic MDPs can be solved by performing only a few steps of value iteration on the random policy's Q function and then acting greedily. When this is true, we find that it is possible to separate the exploration and learning components of RL, making it much easier to analyze. We introduce a new RL algorithm, SQIRL, that iteratively learns a near-optimal policy by exploring randomly to collect rollouts and then performing a limited number of steps of fitted-Q iteration over those roll- outs. We find that any regression algorithm that satisfies basic in-distribution generalization properties can be used in SQIRL to efficiently solve common MDPs. This can explain why deep RL works with complex function approximators like neural networks, since it is empirically established that neural networks generalize well in-distribution. Furthermore, SQIRL explains why random exploration works well in practice, since we show many environments can be solved by effectively estimating the random policy's Q-function and then applying zero or a few steps of value iteration. We leverage SQIRL to derive instance-dependent sample complexity bounds for RL that are exponential only in an "effective horizon" of lookahead—which is typically much smaller than the full horizon—and on the complexity of the class used for function approximation. Empirically, we also find that SQIRL performance strongly correlates with PPO and DQN performance in a variety of stochastic environments, supporting that our theoretical analysis is predictive of practical performance.

  abstract = {When a small number of poisoned samples are injected into the training dataset of a deep neural network, the network can be induced to exhibit malicious behavior during inferences, which poses potential threats to real-world applications. While they have been intensively studied in classification, backdoor attacks on semantic segmentation have been largely overlooked. Unlike classification, semantic segmentation aims to classify every pixel within a given image. In this work, we explore backdoor attacks on segmentation models to misclassify all pixels of a victim class by injecting a specific trigger on non-victim pixels during inferences, which is dubbed Influencer Backdoor Attack (IBA). IBA is expected to maintain the classification accuracy of non-victim pixels and mislead classifications of all victim pixels in every single inference and could be easily applied to real-world scenes. Based on the context aggregation ability of segmentation models, we proposed a simple, yet effective, Nearest-Neighbor trigger injection strategy. We also introduce an innovative Pixel Random Labeling strategy which maintains optimal performance even when the trigger is placed far from the victim pixels. Our extensive experiments reveal that current segmentation models do suffer from backdoor attacks, demonstrate IBA real-world applicability, and show that our proposed techniques can further increase attack performance.},

This connection has reignited interest in comprehending the specific graph properties effectively distinguishable by the $k$WL test. A central focus of research in this field revolves around determining the least dimensionality $k$, for which $k$WL can discern graphs with different number of occurrences of a pattern graph $p$. We refer to such a least $k$ as the WL-dimension of this pattern counting problem. This inquiry traditionally delves into two distinct counting problems related to patterns: subgraph counting and induced subgraph counting. Intriguingly, despite their initial appearance as separate challenges with seemingly divergent approaches, both of these problems are interconnected components of a more comprehensive problem: "graph motif parameters". In this paper, we provide a precise characterization of the WL-dimension of labeled graph motif parameters. As specific instances of this result, we obtain characterizations of the WL-dimension of the subgraph counting and induced subgraph counting problem for every labeled pattern $p$. Particularly noteworthy is our resolution of a problem left open in previous work concerning induced copies. We additionally demonstrate that in cases where the $k$WL test distinguishes between graphs with varying occurrences of a pattern $p$, the exact number of occurrences of $p$ can be computed uniformly using only local information of the last layer of a corresponding GNN. We finally delve into the challenge of recognizing the WL-dimension of various graph parameters. We give a polynomial time algorithm for determining the WL-dimension of the subgraph counting problem for given pattern $p$, answering an open question from previous work. We additionally show how to utilize deep results from the field of graph motif parameters, together with our characterization, to determine the WL-dimension of induced subgraph counting and counting $k$-graphlets.},

Training PINNs using this loss function is challenging as it typically requires selecting large numbers of points of different types, each with different training dynamics.

PINNACLE uses information on the interactions among training point types, which had not been considered before, based on an analysis of PINN training dynamics via the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK).

  abstract = {Optimizing and certifying the positivity of polynomials are fundamental primitives across mathematics and engineering applications, from dynamical systems to operations research. However, solving these problems in practice requires large semidefinite programs, with poor scaling in dimension and degree. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that neural networks can effectively solve such problems in a data-driven fashion, achieving tenfold speedups while retaining high accuracy. Moreover, we observe that these polynomial learning problems are equivariant to the non-compact group $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, which consists of area-preserving linear transformations. We therefore adapt our learning pipelines to accommodate this structure, including data augmentation, a new $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$-equivariant architecture, and an architecture equivariant with respect to its maximal compact subgroup, $SO(2, \mathbb{R})$. Surprisingly, the most successful approaches in practice do not enforce equivariance to the entire group, which we prove arises from an unusual lack of architecture universality for $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ in particular. A consequence of this result, which is of independent interest, is that there exists an equivariant function for which there is no sequence of equivariant polynomials multiplied by arbitrary invariants that approximates the original function. This is a rare example of a symmetric problem where data augmentation outperforms a fully equivariant architecture, and provides interesting lessons in both theory and practice for other problems with non-compact symmetries.},

To address this gap, we explore the design space of {E(3)}-equivariant diffusion models, focusing on previously unexplored areas. Our extensive comparative analysis evaluates the interplay between continuous and discrete state spaces. From this investigation, we present the {EQGAT}-diff model, which consistently outperforms established models for the {QM9} and {GEOM}-Drugs datasets. Significantly, {EQGAT}-diff takes continuous atom positions, while chemical elements and bond types are categorical and uses time-dependent loss weighting, substantially increasing training convergence, the quality of generated samples, and inference time. We also showcase that including chemically motivated additional features like hybridization states in the diffusion process enhances the validity of generated molecules. To further strengthen the applicability of diffusion models to limited training data, we investigate the transferability of {EQGAT}-diff trained on the large {PubChem3D} dataset with implicit hydrogen atoms to target different data distributions. Fine-tuning {EQGAT}-diff for just a few iterations shows an efficient distribution shift, further improving performance throughout data sets.

Therefore, it is common to exploit translation and label projection to further improve the performance by (1) translating training data that is available in a high-resource language (e.g., English) together with the gold labels into low-resource languages, and/or (2) translating test data in low-resource languages to a high-source language to run inference on, then projecting the predicted span-level labels back onto the original test data. However, state-of-the-art marker-based label projection methods suffer from translation quality degradation due to the extra label markers injected in the input to the translation model. In this work, we explore a new direction that leverages constrained decoding for label projection to overcome the aforementioned issues. Our new method not only can preserve the quality of translated texts but also has the versatility of being applicable to both translating training and translating test data strategies. This versatility is crucial as our experiments reveal that translating test data can lead to a considerable boost in performance compared to translating only training data. We evaluate on two cross-lingual transfer tasks, namely Named Entity Recognition and Event Argument Extraction, spanning 20 languages. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art marker-based method by a large margin and also shows better performance than other label projection methods that rely on external word alignment.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models ({LLMs}) have already become quite proficient at solving simpler programming tasks like those in {HumanEval} or {MBPP} benchmarks. However, solving more complex and competitive programming tasks is still quite challenging for these models - possibly due to their tendency to generate solutions as monolithic code blocks instead of decomposing them into logical sub-tasks and sub-modules. On the other hand, experienced programmers instinctively write modularized code with abstraction for solving complex tasks, often reusing previously developed modules. To address this gap, we propose {CodeChain}, a novel framework for inference that elicits modularized code generation through a chain of self-revisions, each being guided by some representative sub-modules generated in previous iterations. Concretely, {CodeChain} first instructs the {LLM} to generate modularized codes through chain-of-thought prompting. Then it applies a chain of self-revisions by iterating the two steps: 1) extracting and clustering the generated sub-modules and selecting the cluster representatives as the more generic and re-usable implementations, and 2) augmenting the original chain-of-thought prompt with these selected module-implementations and instructing the {LLM} to re-generate new modularized solutions. We find that by naturally encouraging the {LLM} to reuse the previously developed and verified sub-modules, {CodeChain} can significantly boost both modularity as well as correctness of the generated solutions, achieving relative pass@1 improvements of 35\% on {APPS} and 76\% on {CodeContests}. It is shown to be effective on both {OpenAI} {LLMs} as well as open-sourced {LLMs} like {WizardCoder}. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies with different methods of prompting, number of clusters, model sizes, program qualities, etc., to provide useful insights that underpin {CodeChain}'s success.},

  abstract = {Mesh deformation plays a pivotal role in many {3D} vision tasks including dynamic simulations, rendering, and reconstruction. However, defining an efficient discrepancy between predicted and target meshes remains an open problem. A prevalent approach in current deep learning is the set-based approach which measures the discrepancy between two surfaces by comparing two randomly sampled point-clouds from the two meshes with Chamfer pseudo-distance. Nevertheless, the set-based approach still has limitations such as lacking a theoretical guarantee for choosing the number of points in sampled point-clouds, and the pseudo-metricity and the quadratic complexity of the Chamfer divergence. To address these issues, we propose a novel metric for learning mesh deformation. The metric is defined by sliced Wasserstein distance on meshes represented as probability measures that generalize the set-based approach. By leveraging probability measure space, we gain flexibility in encoding meshes using diverse forms of probability measures, such as continuous, empirical, and discrete measures via varifold representation. After having encoded probability measures, we can compare meshes by using the sliced Wasserstein distance which is an effective optimal transport distance with linear computational complexity and can provide a fast statistical rate for approximating the surface of meshes. To the end, we employ a neural ordinary differential equation ({ODE}) to deform the input surface into the target shape by modeling the trajectories of the points on the surface. Our experiments on cortical surface reconstruction demonstrate that our approach surpasses other competing methods in multiple datasets and metrics.},

Subsampling the graph is a viable alternative, but sampling on graphs is nontrivial as graphs are non-Euclidean. Existing graph sampling techniques require not only computing the spectra of large matrices but also repeating these computations when the graph changes, e.g., grows. In this paper, we introduce a signal sampling theory for a type of graph limit---the graphon. We prove a {Poincar{\'e}} inequality for graphon signals and show that complements of node subsets satisfying this inequality are unique sampling sets for {Paley-Wiener} spaces of graphon signals. Exploiting connections with spectral clustering and {Gaussian} elimination, we prove that such sampling sets are consistent in the sense that unique sampling sets on a convergent graph sequence converge to unique sampling sets on the graphon. We then propose a related graphon signal sampling algorithm for large graphs, and demonstrate its good empirical performance on graph machine learning tasks.},

However, this approach faces limitations when applied to scene-centric datasets, where multiple objects within an image are only implicitly captured in the global representation. Such global bootstrapping can lead to undesirable entanglement of object representations. Furthermore, even object-centric datasets stand to benefit from a finer-grained bootstrapping approach. In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel Cross-Image Object-Level Bootstrapping method tailored to enhance dense visual representation learning. By employing object-level nearest neighbor bootstrapping throughout the training, {CrIBo} emerges as a notably strong and adequate candidate for in-context learning, leveraging nearest neighbor retrieval at test time. {CrIBo} shows state-of-the-art performance on the latter task while being highly competitive in more standard downstream segmentation tasks.

A tractable alternative approach consists in computing instead the best rank-one (matrix) approximation of an unfolding of the observed tensor data, but its performance was hitherto unknown. We quantify here the performance gap between these two approaches, in particular by deriving the precise algorithmic threshold of the unfolding approach and demonstrating that it exhibits a {BBP}-type transition behavior.

Its canonical version asks how to pack items of different values and weights arriving online into a capacity-limited knapsack so as to maximize the total value of the admitted items. Although optimal competitive algorithms are known for this problem, they may be fundamentally unfair, i.e., individual items may be treated inequitably in different ways. We formalize a practically-relevant notion of time fairness which effectively models a trade off between static and dynamic pricing in a motivating application such as cloud resource allocation, and show that existing algorithms perform poorly under this metric. We propose a parameterized deterministic algorithm where the parameter precisely captures the {Pareto}-optimal trade-off between fairness (static pricing) and competitiveness (dynamic pricing). We show that randomization is theoretically powerful enough to be simultaneously competitive and fair; however, it does not work well in experiments. To further improve the trade-off between fairness and competitiveness, we develop a nearly-optimal learning-augmented algorithm which is fair, consistent, and robust (competitive), showing substantial performance improvements in numerical experiments.},

Despite its success, we found that surprisingly, reward prediction is often a bottleneck of {MBRL}, especially for sparse rewards that are challenging (or even ambiguous) to predict. Motivated by the intuition that humans can learn from rough reward estimates, we propose a simple yet effective reward smoothing approach, {DreamSmooth}, which learns to predict a temporally-smoothed reward, instead of the exact reward at the given timestep.

@inproceedings{lee2024continual,
  abstract = {Deep neural networks ({DNNs}) have revolutionized tasks such as image classification and speech recognition but often falter when training and test data diverge in distribution. External factors, from weather effects on images to varied speech environments, can cause this discrepancy, compromising {DNN} performance. Online test-time adaptation ({OTTA}) methods present a promising solution, recalibrating models in real-time during the test stage without requiring historical data. However, the {OTTA} paradigm is imperfect, often falling prey to issues such as catastrophic forgetting due to its reliance on noisy, self-trained predictions. Although some contemporary strategies mitigate this by tying adaptations to the static source model, this restricts model flexibility. This paper introduces a continual momentum filtering ({CMF}) framework, leveraging the {Kalman} filter ({KF}) to strike a balance between model adaptability and information retention. The {CMF} intertwines optimization via stochastic gradient descent with a {KF}-based inference process. This methodology not only aids in averting catastrophic forgetting but also provides high adaptability to shifting data distributions. We validate our framework on various {OTTA} scenarios and real-world situations regarding covariate and label shifts, and the {CMF} consistently shows superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

Although successful, previous works do not account for the specific localization of said attributes extended into the three dimensional plane. In this context, we present a conditional diffusion model that integrates control over three-dimensional object placement with disentangled representations of global stylistic semantics from multiple exemplar images. Specifically, we first introduce depth disentanglement training to leverage the relative depth of objects as an estimator, allowing the model to identify the absolute positions of unseen objects through the use of synthetic image triplets. We also introduce soft guidance, a method for imposing global semantics onto targeted regions without the use of any additional localization cues. Our integrated framework, Compose and Conquer ({CnC}), unifies these techniques to localize multiple conditions in a disentangled manner. We demonstrate that our approach allows perception of objects at varying depths while offering a versatile framework for composing localized objects with different global semantics.},

In order to address this issue, some recent works on {OPE} proposed in-sample learning with importance resampling. Yet, these approaches are not applicable to deterministic target policies for continuous action spaces. To address this limitation, we propose to relax the deterministic target policy using a kernel and learn the kernel metrics that minimize the overall mean squared error of the estimated temporal difference update vector of an action value function, where the action value function is used for policy evaluation. We derive the bias and variance of the estimation error due to this relaxation and provide analytic solutions for the optimal kernel metric. In empirical studies using various test domains, we show that the {OPE} with in-sample learning using the kernel with optimized metric achieves significantly improved accuracy than other baselines.},

However, we argue that they have overlooked the impact of knowledge transfer when the training dataset of a certain task is biased -- namely, when the dataset contains some spurious correlations that can overly influence the prediction rule of a model. In this work, we carefully design systematic experiments using three benchmark datasets to answer the question from our empirical findings. Specifically, we first show through two-task {CL} experiments that standard {CL} methods, which are oblivious of the dataset bias, can transfer bias from one task to another, both forward and backward. Moreover, we find out this transfer is exacerbated depending on whether the {CL} methods focus on stability or plasticity. We then present that the bias is also transferred and even accumulates in longer task sequences. Finally, we offer a standardized experimental setup and a simple, yet strong plug-in baseline method, dubbed as group-class Balanced Greedy Sampling ({BGS}), which are utilized for the development of more advanced bias-aware {CL} methods.},

  abstract = {The disparity in accuracy between classes in standard training is amplified during adversarial training, a phenomenon termed the robust fairness problem. Existing methodologies aimed to enhance robust fairness by sacrificing the model's performance on easier classes in order to improve its performance on harder ones. However, we observe that under adversarial attacks, the majority of the model's predictions for samples from the worst class are biased towards classes similar to the worst class, rather than towards the easy classes. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that robust fairness deteriorates as the distance between classes decreases. Motivated by these insights, we introduce the Distance-Aware Fair Adversarial Training ({DAFA}) methodology, which addresses robust fairness by taking into account the similarities between classes. Specifically, our method assigns distinct adversarial margins and loss weights to each class and adjusts them to encourage a trade-off in robustness among similar classes. Experimental results across various datasets demonstrate that our method not only maintains average robust accuracy but also significantly improves the worst robust accuracy, indicating a marked improvement in robust fairness compared to existing methods.},

However, they are not designed to produce a distilled dataset that can be effectively used for facilitating self-supervised pre-training. To address this, we propose a novel problem of distilling an unlabeled dataset into a set of small synthetic samples for efficient self-supervised learning ({SSL}). We prove that gradient calculation in naive bilevel optimization is biased due to randomness from data augmentations or masking. Our solution involves: (1) minimizing mean squared error between a model's synthetic example representations and learnable target feature representations; (2) introducing {MSE} between representations of the inner model and self-supervised target model; (3) optimizing only a linear head on a fixed feature extractor to reduce computational cost.

In these transfer learning scenarios, the prior distribution for downstream data becomes crucial in {Bayesian} model averaging ({BMA}). While previous works proposed the prior over the neural network parameters centered around the pre-trained solution, such strategies have limitations when dealing with distribution shifts between upstream and downstream data. This paper introduces nonparametric transfer learning ({NPTL}), a flexible posterior sampling method to address the distribution shift issue within the context of nonparametric learning. The nonparametric learning ({NPL}) method is a recent approach that employs a nonparametric prior for posterior sampling, efficiently accounting for model misspecification scenarios, which is suitable for transfer learning scenarios that may involve the distribution shift between upstream and downstream tasks.

Hence, $d$ can still scale with $S$ depending on the direct reachability of the environment. To address this limitation of linear {MDPs}, we propose a novel structural aggregation framework based on dynamics, named as the 'dynamics aggregation'. For this newly proposed framework, we design a provably efficient hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm in linear function approximation that leverages aggregated sub-structures. Our proposed algorithm exhibits statistical efficiency, achieving a regret of $\tilde{O} ( d_{\psi}^{3/2} H^{3/2}\sqrt{ N T} )$, where $d_{\psi}$ represents the feature dimension of aggregated sub{MDPs} and $N$ signifies the number of aggregated sub{MDPs}. We establish that the condition $d_{\psi}^3 N \ll d^{3}$ is readily met in most real-world environments with hierarchical structures, enabling a substantial improvement in the regret bound compared to {LSVI}-{UCB}, which enjoys a regret of $\tilde{O} (d^{3/2} H^{3/2} \sqrt{ T})$.

However, contrasting similar time series instances or values from adjacent timestamps within a time series leads to ignore their inherent correlations, which results in deteriorating the quality of learned representations. To address this issue, we propose {SoftCLT}, a simple yet effective soft contrastive learning strategy for time series. This is achieved by introducing instance-wise and temporal contrastive loss with soft assignments ranging from zero to one. Specifically, we define soft assignments for 1) instance-wise contrastive loss by the distance between time series on the data space, and 2) temporal contrastive loss by the difference of timestamps. {SoftCLT} is a plug-and-play method for time series contrastive learning that improves the quality of learned representations without bells and whistles. In experiments, we demonstrate that {SoftCLT} consistently improves the performance in various downstream tasks including classification, semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and anomaly detection, showing state-of-the-art performance.},

Inspired by masked image modeling in computer vision, recent works first patchify and partially mask out time series, and then train {Transformers} to capture the dependencies between patches by predicting masked patches from unmasked patches. However, we argue that capturing such patch dependencies might not be an optimal strategy for time series representation learning; rather, learning to embed patches independently results in better time series representations. To this end, we propose a simple patch reconstruction task that autoencode each patch without looking at other patches, and a simple patch-wise {MLP} that embeds each patch independently. In addition, we introduce complementary contrastive learning to hierarchically capture adjacent time series information efficiently. Our proposed method improves time series forecasting and classification performance compared to state-of-the-art {Transformer}-based models, while being more efficient in terms of parameters and training/inference time.},

On the other hand, methods using grids are free from spectral bias and achieve fast training speed, however, at the expense of high spatial complexity. We propose Coordinate-Aware Modulation ({CAM}), which modulates the intermediate features using scale and shift parameters extracted from the grid representations. This can maintain the strengths of {MLPs} while mitigating any remaining potential biases, facilitating the rapid learning of high-frequency components. In addition, we empirically found that the feature normalizations, which have not been successful in neural field literature, proved to be effective when applied in conjunction with the proposed {CAM}. Experimental results demonstrate that {CAM} enhances the performance of neural representation and improves learning stability across a range of signals.},

  abstract = {Large language models like {GPT}-4 exhibit emergent capabilities across general-purpose tasks, such as basic arithmetic, when trained on extensive text data, even though these tasks are not explicitly encoded by the unsupervised, next-token prediction objective. This study investigates how even small transformers, trained from random initialization, can efficiently learn arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, and elementary functions like square root, using the next-token prediction objective. We first demonstrate that conventional training data is not the most effective for arithmetic learning, and simple formatting changes can significantly improve accuracy. This leads to sharp phase transitions as a function of training data scale, which, in some cases, can be explained through connections to low-rank matrix completion. Building on prior work, we then train on chain-of-thought style data that includes intermediate step results. Even in the complete absence of pretraining, this approach significantly and simultaneously improves accuracy, sample complexity, and convergence speed. We also study the interplay between arithmetic and text data during training and examine the effects of few-shot prompting, pretraining, and parameter scaling. Additionally, we discuss the challenges associated with length generalization. Our work highlights the importance of high-quality, instructive data that considers the particular characteristics of the next-word prediction loss for rapidly eliciting arithmetic capabilities.},

However, such an approach inevitably results in the use of random timesteps at each update, which increases the variance of the gradient and ultimately prolongs the optimization process. In this paper, we propose to enhance the text-to-{3D} optimization by leveraging the {T2I} diffusion prior in the generative sampling process with a predetermined timestep schedule. To this end, we interpret text-to-{3D} optimization as a multi-view image-to-image translation problem, and propose a solution by approximating the probability flow. By leveraging the proposed novel optimization algorithm, we design {DreamFlow}, a practical three-stage coarse-to-fine text-to-{3D} optimization framework that enables fast generation of high-quality and high-resolution (i.e., $1024 \times 1024$) {3D} contents.

  abstract = {Current evaluation protocols predominantly assess physical reasoning in stationary scenes, creating a gap in evaluating agents' abilities to interact with dynamic events. While contemporary methods allow agents to modify initial scene configurations and observe consequences, they lack the capability to interact with events in real time. To address this, we introduce {I-PHYRE}, a framework that challenges agents to simultaneously exhibit intuitive physical reasoning, multi-step planning, and in-situ intervention. In {I-PHYRE}, agents are required to reason about the physics and then interact with a scene to achieve a goal by placing objects and applying forces. Successful task solving demands ``intuitive physical reasoning'' (i.e., a quick, approximate understanding of physics), ``multi-step'' planning (i.e., an extensive sequence planning where each intervention can alter subsequent choices), and ``in-situ'' intervention (i.e., timely object manipulation where the timing deviations can cause task failure). We formulated four game splits to scrutinize agents' learning and generalization of interactive physical reasoning principles. We explored three planning strategies and examined both supervised and reinforcement agents' zero-shot generalization proficiency on {I-PHYRE}. The outcomes highlight a notable gap between existing learning algorithms and human performance, emphasizing the need for more research in enhancing agents with interactive physical reasoning capabilities.},

  abstract = {Despite the promising few-shot ability of large language models ({LLMs}), the standard paradigm of In-context Learning ({ICL}) suffers the disadvantages of susceptibility to selected demonstrations and the intricacy to generate these demonstrations. In this paper, we raise the fundamental question that whether human-generated demonstrations are necessary for {ICL}. To answer this question, we propose self-contemplation prompting strategy ({SEC}), a paradigm free from human-crafted demonstrations. The key point of {SEC} is that, instead of using hand-crafted examples as demonstrations in {ICL}, {SEC} asks {LLMs} to first create demonstrations on their own, based on which the final output is generated. {SEC} is a flexible framework and can be adapted to both the vanilla {ICL} and the chain-of-thought ({CoT}), but with greater ease: as the manual-generation process of both examples and rationale can be saved. Extensive experiments in arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, multi-task language understanding, and code generation benchmarks, show that {SEC}, which does not require hand-crafted demonstrations, significantly outperforms the zero-shot learning strategy, and achieves comparable results to {ICL} with hand-crafted demonstrations. Our finding demonstrates that for many tasks, contemporary {LLMs} possess a sufficient level of competence to exclusively depend on their own capacity for decision making, removing the need for external training data.},

  abstract = {Quantization is an indispensable technique for serving Large Language Models ({LLMs}) and has recently found its way into {LoRA} fine-tuning. In this work we focus on the scenario where quantization and {LoRA} fine-tuning are applied together on a pre-trained model. In such cases it is common to observe a consistent gap in the performance on downstream tasks between full fine-tuning and quantization plus {LoRA} fine-tuning approach. In response, we propose {LoftQ} ({LoRA}-Fine-Tuning-aware Quantization), a novel quantization framework that simultaneously quantizes an {LLM} and finds a proper low-rank initialization for {LoRA} fine-tuning. Such an initialization alleviates the discrepancy between the quantized and full-precision model and significantly improves generalization in downstream tasks. We evaluate our method on natural language understanding, question answering, summarization, and natural language generation tasks. Experiments show that our method is highly effective and outperforms existing quantization methods, especially in the challenging 2-bit and 2/4-bit mixed precision regimes.},

However, existing methods either rely on score distillation-based optimization which suffer from slow inference, low diversity and Janus problems, or are feed-forward methods that generate low-quality results due to the scarcity of 3D training data. In this paper, we propose Instant3D, a novel method that generates high-quality and diverse 3D assets from text prompts in a feed-forward manner. We adopt a two-stage paradigm, which first generates a sparse set of four structured and consistent views from text in one shot with a fine-tuned 2D text-to-image diffusion model, and then directly regresses the NeRF from the generated images with a novel transformer-based sparse-view reconstructor. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method can generate diverse 3D assets of high visual quality within 20 seconds, which is two orders of magnitude faster than previous optimization-based methods that can take 1 to 10 hours.},

@inproceedings{li2024crossloco,
  abstract = {Human motion driven control ({HMDC}) is an effective approach for generating natural and compelling robot motions while preserving high-level semantics. However, establishing the correspondence between humans and robots with different body structures is not straightforward due to the mismatches in kinematics and dynamics properties, which causes intrinsic ambiguity to the problem. Many previous algorithms approach this motion retargeting problem with unsupervised learning, which requires the prerequisite skill sets. However, it will be extremely costly to learn all the skills without understanding the given human motions, particularly for high-dimensional robots. In this work, we introduce CrossLoco, a guided unsupervised reinforcement learning framework that simultaneously learns robot skills and their correspondence to human motions. Our key innovation is to introduce a cycle-consistency-based reward term designed to maximize the mutual information between human motions and robot states. We demonstrate that the proposed framework can generate compelling robot motions by translating diverse human motions, such as running, hopping, and dancing. We quantitatively compare our CrossLoco against the manually engineered and unsupervised baseline algorithms along with the ablated versions of our framework and demonstrate that our method translates human motions with better accuracy, diversity, and user preference. We also showcase its utility in other applications, such as synthesizing robot movements from language input and enabling interactive robot control.},

@inproceedings{li2024get,
  abstract = {The success of recent text-to-image diffusion models is largely due to their capacity to be guided by a complex text prompt, which enables users to precisely describe the desired content. However, these models struggle to effectively suppress the generation of undesired content, which is explicitly requested to be omitted from the generated image in the prompt. In this paper, we analyze how to manipulate the text embeddings and remove unwanted content from them. We introduce two contributions, which we refer to as soft-weighted regularization and inference-time text embedding optimization. The first regularizes the text embedding matrix and effectively suppresses the undesired content. The second method aims to further suppress the unwanted content generation of the prompt, and encourages the generation of desired content. We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on extensive experiments, validating its effectiveness. Furthermore, our method is generalizable to both the pixel-space diffusion models (i.e. {DeepFloyd-IF}) and the latent-space diffusion models (i.e. Stable Diffusion).},

@inproceedings{li2024towards,
  abstract = {Language Models ({LMs}) have greatly influenced diverse domains. However, their inherent limitation in comprehending {3D} molecular structures has considerably constrained their potential in the biomolecular domain. To bridge this gap, we focus on {3D} molecule-text interpretation, and propose {3D-MoLM}: {3D}-Molecular Language Modeling. Specifically, {3D-MoLM} enables an {LM} to interpret and analyze {3D} molecules by equipping the {LM} with a {3D} molecular encoder. This integration is achieved by a {3D} molecule-text projector, bridging the {3D} molecular encoder's representation space and the {LM}'s input space. Moreover, to enhance {3D-MoLM}'s ability of cross-modal molecular understanding and instruction following, we meticulously curated a {3D} molecule-centric instruction tuning dataset -- {3D-MoIT}. Through {3D} molecule-text alignment and {3D} molecule-centric instruction tuning, {3D-MoLM} establishes an integration of {3D} molecular encoder and {LM}. It significantly surpasses existing baselines on downstream tasks, including molecule-text retrieval, molecule captioning, and more challenging open-text molecular {QA} tasks, especially focusing on {3D}-dependent properties.},

@inproceedings{li2024fewshot,
  abstract = {Can a pre-trained generator be adapted to the hybrid of multiple target domains and generate images with integrated attributes of them? In this work, we introduce a new task -- Few-shot Hybrid Domain Adaptation ({HDA}). Given a source generator and several target domains, {HDA} aims to acquire an adapted generator that preserves the integrated attributes of all target domains, without overriding the source domain's characteristics. Compared with Domain Adaptation ({DA}), {HDA} offers greater flexibility and versatility to adapt generators to more composite and expansive domains. Simultaneously, {HDA} also presents more challenges than {DA} as we have access only to images from individual target domains and lack authentic images from the hybrid domain. To address this issue, we introduce a discriminator-free framework that directly encodes different domains' images into well-separable subspaces. To achieve {HDA}, we propose a novel directional subspace loss comprised of a distance loss and a direction loss. Concretely, the distance loss blends the attributes of all target domains by reducing the distances from generated images to all target subspaces. The direction loss preserves the characteristics from the source domain by guiding the adaptation along the perpendicular to subspaces. Experiments show that our method can obtain numerous domain-specific attributes in a single adapted generator, which surpasses the baseline methods in semantic similarity, image fidelity, and cross-domain consistency.},

@inproceedings{li2024learning,
  abstract = {Generalized Linear Models ({GLMs}) encompass a wide array of regression and classification models, where prediction is a function of a linear combination of the input variables. Often in real-world scenarios, a number of observations would be added into or removed from the existing training dataset, necessitating the development of learning systems that can efficiently train optimal models with varying observations in an online (sequential) manner instead of retraining from scratch. Despite the significance of data-varying scenarios, most existing approaches to sparse {GLMs} concentrate on offline batch updates, leaving online solutions largely underexplored. In this work, we present the first algorithm without compromising accuracy for {GLMs} regularized by sparsity-enforcing penalties trained on varying observations. Our methodology is capable of handling the addition and deletion of observations simultaneously, while adaptively updating data-dependent regularization parameters to ensure the best statistical performance. Specifically, we recast sparse {GLMs} as a bilevel optimization objective upon varying observations and characterize it as an explicit gradient flow in the underlying space for the inner and outer subproblems we are optimizing over, respectively. We further derive a set of rules to ensure a proper transition at regions of non-smoothness, and establish the guarantees of theoretical consistency and finite convergence. Encouraging results are exhibited on real-world benchmarks.},

@inproceedings{li2024merge,
  abstract = {Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts ({SMoE}) has shown promise to scale up the learning capacity of neural networks, however, they have issues like: (a) High Memory Usage, due to duplication of the network layers into multiple copies as experts; and (b) Redundancy in Experts, as common learning-based routing policies suffer from representational collapse. Therefore, vanilla {SMoE} models are memory inefficient and non-scalable, especially for resource-constrained downstream scenarios. In this paper, we ask: Can we craft a compact {SMoE} model by consolidating expert information? What is the best recipe to merge multiple experts into fewer but more knowledgeable experts? Our pilot investigation reveals that conventional model merging methods fail to be effective in such expert merging for {SMoE}. The potential reasons are: (1) redundant information overshadows critical experts; (2) appropriate neuron permutation for each expert is missing to bring all of them in alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel merging algorithm for {SMoE}, i.e., M-{SMoE}, which leverages routing statistics to guide expert merging. Specifically, it starts with neuron permutation alignment for experts; then, dominant experts and their ``group members'' are formed based on routing policies; lastly, every expert group is merged into a single expert by utilizing each expert's activation frequency as their weight for merging, thus diminishing the impact of insignificant experts. Moreover, we draw an interesting observation that our proposed merging promotes a low dimensionality in the merged expert's weight space, naturally paving the way for additional compression. Hence, our final method, MC-{SMoE} (i.e., Merge, then Compress {SMoE}), further decomposes the merged experts into low-rank and structural sparse alternatives. Extensive experiments across 8 benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our proposals. For instance, our MC-{SMoE} achieves up to 80\% memory and a 20\% {FLOPs} reduction, with virtually no loss in performance.},

This paper pioneers the investigation into the potential pitfalls associated with knowledge editing for {LLMs}. To achieve this, we introduce new benchmark datasets and propose innovative evaluation metrics. Our results underline two pivotal concerns: (1) Knowledge Conflict: Editing groups of facts that logically clash can magnify the inherent inconsistencies in {LLMs}---a facet neglected by previous methods. (2) Knowledge Distortion: Altering parameters with the aim of editing factual knowledge can irrevocably warp the innate knowledge structure of {LLMs}.

However, current latent-action-based methods are limited to discrete spaces and require expensive planning steps.

Chiefly, in cascaded models each intermediary scale introduces extraneous variables that cannot be tractably marginalized out for likelihood evaluation. This issue vanishes by modeling the diffusion process on latent spaces induced by a class of transformations we call hierarchical volume-preserving maps, which decompose spatially structured data in a hierarchical fashion without introducing local distortions in the latent space.

  abstract = {We explore the robustness of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (c-MARL) against Byzantine failures, where any agent can enact arbitrary, worst-case actions due to malfunction or adversarial attack. To address the uncertainty that any agent can be adversarial, we propose a Bayesian Adversarial Robust Dec-POMDP (BARDec-POMDP) framework, which views Byzantine adversaries as nature-dictated types, represented by a separate transition. This allows agents to learn policies grounded on their posterior beliefs about the type of other agents, fostering collaboration with ideal teammates while defending against adversaries. We define the optimal solution to the BARDec-POMDP as an ex post robust Bayesian Markov perfect equilibrium, which we proof to exist and weakly dominates the equilibrium of previous robust MARL approaches. To realize this equilibrium, we put forward a two-timescale actor-critic algorithm with almost sure convergence under specific conditions. Experimentation on matrix games, level-based foraging and StarCraft II indicate that, even under worst-case perturbations, our method successfully acquires intricate micromanagement skills and adaptively aligns with allies, demonstrating resilience against non-oblivious adversaries, random allies, observation-based attacks, and transfer-based attacks.},

However, existing machine unlearning methods have been primarily focused on classification models, leaving the landscape of unlearning for generative models relatively unexplored. This paper serves as a bridge, addressing the gap by providing a unifying framework of machine unlearning for image-to-image generative models. Within this framework, we propose a computationally-efficient algorithm, underpinned by rigorous theoretical analysis, that demonstrates negligible performance degradation on the retain samples, while effectively removing the information from the forget samples. Empirical studies on two large-scale datasets, ImageNet-1K and Places-365, further show that our algorithm does not rely on the availability of the retain samples, which further complies with data retention policy. To our best knowledge, this work is the first that represents systemic, theoretical, empirical explorations of machine unlearning specifically tailored for image-to-image generative models.},

@inproceedings{li2024fedda,
  abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is an emerging learning paradigm where a set of distributed clients learns a task under the coordination of a server. The FedAvg algorithm is one of the most widely used methods in FL. In FedAvg, the learning rate is a constant rather than changing adaptively. Adaptive gradient methods have demonstrated superior performance over the constant learning rate schedules in non-distributed settings, and they have recently been adapted to FL. However, the majority of these methods are designed for unconstrained settings. Meanwhile, many crucial FL applications, like disease diagnosis and biomarker identification, often rely on constrained formulations such as Lasso and group Lasso. It remains an open question as to whether adaptive gradient methods can be effectively applied to FL problems with constrains. In this work, we introduce FedDA, a novel adaptive gradient framework for FL. This framework utilizes a restarted dual averaging technique and is compatible with a range of gradient estimation methods and adaptive learning rate schedules. Specifically, an instantiation of our framework FedDA-MVR achieves sample complexity $\tilde{O}(K^{-1}\epsilon^{-1.5})$ and communication complexity $\tilde{O}(K^{-0.25}\epsilon^{-1.25})$ for finding a stationary point $\epsilon$ in the constrained setting with $K$ be the number of clients. We conduct experiments over both constrained and unconstrained tasks to confirm the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract = {This paper studies zero-shot anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) in industrial vision. We reveal that the abundant normal and abnormal cues implicit in unlabeled test images can be exploited for anomaly determination, which is ignored by prior methods. Our key observation is that for the industrial product images, the normal image patches could find a relatively large number of similar patches in other unlabeled images, while the abnormal ones only have a few similar patches. We leverage such a discriminative characteristic to design a novel zero-shot AC/AS method by Mutual Scoring (MuSc) of the unlabeled images, which does not need any training or prompts. Specifically, we perform Local Neighborhood Aggregation with Multiple Degrees (LNAMD) to obtain the patch features that are capable of representing anomalies in varying sizes. Then we propose the Mutual Scoring Mechanism (MSM) to leverage the unlabeled test images to assign the anomaly score to each other. Furthermore, we present an optimization approach named Re-scoring with Constrained Image-level Neighborhood (RsCIN) for image-level anomaly classification to suppress the false positives caused by noises in normal images. The superior performance on the challenging MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.},

In this work, we address this issue by learning the inherent structure of action-wise similar MDP to appropriately balance the performance degradation versus sample/computational complexity. In particular, we partition the action spaces into multiple groups based on the similarity in transition distribution and reward function, and build a linear decomposition model to capture the difference between the intra-group transition kernel and the intra-group rewards.

@inproceedings{li2024lanesegnet,
  abstract = {A map, as crucial information for downstream applications of an autonomous driving system, is usually represented in lanelines or centerlines. However, existing literature on map learning primarily focuses on either detecting geometry-based lanelines or perceiving topology relationships of centerlines. Both of these methods ignore the intrinsic relationship of lanelines and centerlines, that lanelines bind centerlines. While simply predicting both types of lane in one model is mutually excluded in learning objective, we advocate lane segment as a new representation that seamlessly incorporates both geometry and topology information. Thus, we introduce LaneSegNet, the first end-to-end mapping network generating lane segments to obtain a complete representation of the road structure. Our algorithm features two key modifications. One is a lane attention module to capture pivotal region details within the long-range feature space. Another is an identical initialization strategy for reference points, which enhances the learning of positional priors for lane attention. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, LaneSegNet outperforms previous counterparts by a substantial gain across three tasks, i.e., map element detection (+4.8 mAP), centerline perception (+6.9 DET_l), and the newly defined one, lane segment perception (+5.6 mAP). Furthermore, it obtains a real-time inference speed of 14.7 FPS.},

The main challenge is how to distinguish high-quality pseudo labels against the confirmation bias. However, existing pseudo-label selection strategies are limited to pre-defined schemes or complex hand-crafted policies specially designed for classification, failing to achieve high-quality labels, fast convergence, and task versatility simultaneously. To these ends, we propose a Semi-supervised Reward framework (SemiReward) that predicts reward scores to evaluate and filter out high-quality pseudo labels, which is pluggable to mainstream SSL methods in wide task types and scenarios. To mitigate confirmation bias, SemiReward is trained online in two stages with a generator model and subsampling strategy. With classification and regression tasks on 13 standard SSL benchmarks across three modalities, extensive experiments verify that SemiReward achieves significant performance gains and faster convergence speeds upon Pseudo Label, FlexMatch, and Free/SoftMatch.},

Current L2I models either suffer from poor editability via text or weak alignment between the generated image and the input layout. This limits their usability in practice. To mitigate this, we propose to integrate adversarial supervision into the conventional training pipeline of L2I diffusion models (ALDM). Specifically, we employ a segmentation-based discriminator which provides explicit feedback to the diffusion generator on the pixel-level alignment between the denoised image and the input layout. To encourage consistent adherence to the input layout over the sampling steps, we further introduce the multistep unrolling strategy. Instead of looking at a single timestep, we unroll a few steps recursively to imitate the inference process, and ask the discriminator to assess the alignment of denoised images with the layout over a certain time window.},

Inferred neural interactions from neural signals primarily reflect functional connectivity. In a long experiment, subject animals may experience different stages defined by the experiment, stimuli, or behavioral states, and hence functional connectivity can change over time. To model dynamically changing functional connectivity, prior work employs state-switching generalized linear models with hidden Markov models (i.e., {HMM}-{GLM}s). However, we argue they lack biological plausibility, as functional connectivities are shaped and confined by the underlying anatomical connectome. Here, we propose two novel prior-informed state-switching {GLM}s, called {G}aussian {HMM}-{GLM} ({G}aussian prior) and one-hot {HMM}-{GLM} ({G}umbel-{S}oftmax one-hot prior). We show that the learned prior should capture the state-invariant interaction, shedding light on the underlying anatomical connectome and revealing more likely physical neuron interactions. The state-dependent interaction modeled by each {GLM} offers traceability to capture functional variations across multiple brain states. Our methods effectively recover true interaction structures in simulated data, achieve the highest predictive likelihood, and enhance the interpretability of interaction patterns and hidden states when applied to real neural data.},

At its core lies a conditional latent 3D diffusion process that lifts 2D editing to 3D space by learning the correlation between the paired images' difference and the instructions via triplet data. With the help of our proposed token position randomization strategy, we could even achieve multi-semantic editing through one single pass with the portrait identity well-preserved. Besides, we further propose an identity consistency module that directly modulates the extracted identity signals into our diffusion process, which increases the multi-view 3D identity consistency. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our method and show its superiority against strong baselines quantitatively and qualitatively.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks ({DNN}s) have been shown to perform well on exclusive, multi-class classification tasks. However, when different classes have similar visual features, it becomes challenging for human annotators to differentiate them. When an image is ambiguous, such as a blurry one where an annotator can't distinguish between a husky and a wolf, it may be labeled with both classes: \{husky, wolf\}. This scenario necessitates the use of composite set labels. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Hyper-Evidential Neural Network ({HENN}) that explicitly models predictive uncertainty due to composite class labels in training data in the context of the belief theory called Subjective Logic ({SL}). By placing a grouped Dirichlet distribution on the class probabilities, we treat predictions of a neural network as parameters of hyper-subjective opinions and learn the network that collects both single and composite evidence leading to these hyper-opinions by a deterministic {DNN} from data. We introduce a new uncertainty type called vagueness originally designed for hyper-opinions in {SL} to quantify composite classification uncertainty for {DNN}s. Our results demonstrate that {HENN} outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts based on four image datasets.},

Since the data is collected separately by each client and always remains decentralized, federated optimization preserves data privacy and allows for large-scale computing, which makes it a promising decentralized machine learning paradigm. Though it is often deployed for tasks that are online in nature, e.g., next-word prediction on keyboard apps, most works formulate it as an offline problem. The few exceptions that consider federated bandit optimization are limited to very simplistic function classes, e.g., linear, generalized linear, or non-parametric function class with bounded {RKHS} norm, which severely hinders its practical usage. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, named {F}ed-{GO}-{UCB}, for federated bandit optimization with generic non-linear objective function.},

  abstract = {Coordinate network or implicit neural representation ({INR}) is a fast-emerging method for encoding natural signals (such as images and videos) with the benefits of a compact neural representation. While numerous methods have been proposed to increase the encoding capabilities of an {INR}, an often overlooked aspect is the inference efficiency, usually measured in multiply-accumulate ({MAC}) count. This is particularly critical in use cases where inference bandwidth is greatly limited by hardware constraints. To this end, we propose the Activation-Sharing Multi-Resolution ({ASMR}) coordinate network that combines multi-resolution coordinate decomposition with hierarchical modulations. Specifically, an {ASMR} model enables the sharing of activations across grids of the data. This largely decouples its inference cost from its depth which is directly correlated to its reconstruction capability, and renders a near $O(1)$ inference complexity irrespective of the number of layers. Experiments show that {ASMR} can reduce the {MAC} of a vanilla {SIREN} model by up to 500$\times$ while achieving an even higher reconstruction quality than its {SIREN} baseline.},

To this end, we derive a simple and novel vision-language manipulation framework, dubbed {R}obo{F}lamingo, built upon the open-source {VLM}s, {O}pen{F}lamingo.

Such a decomposition provides {R}obo{F}lamingo the flexibility for open-loop control and deployment on low-performance platforms. By exceeding the state-of-the-art performance with a large margin on the tested benchmark, we show {R}obo{F}lamingo can be an effective and competitive alternative to adapt {VLM}s to robot control. Our extensive experimental results also reveal several interesting conclusions regarding the behavior of different pre-trained {VLM}s on manipulation tasks.

Sparse {BNN}s have been investigated for efficient inference, typically by either slowly introducing sparsity throughout the training or by post-training compression of dense {BNN}s. To solve this challenge, we introduce Sparse Subspace Variational Inference ({SSVI}), the first fully sparse {BNN} framework that maintains a consistently highly sparse Bayesian model throughout the training and inference phases. Starting from a randomly initialized low-dimensional sparse subspace, our approach alternately optimizes the sparse subspace basis selection and its associated parameters. While basis selection is characterized as a non-differentiable problem, we approximate the optimal solution with a removal-and-addition strategy, guided by novel criteria based on weight distribution statistics. Our extensive experiments show that {SSVI} sets new benchmarks in crafting sparse {BNN}s, achieving, for instance, a 10-20x compression in model size with under 3\% performance drop, and up to 20x {FLOP}s reduction during training compared with dense {VI} training.},

@inproceedings{li2024federated,

This discrepancy has motivated the development of federated causal discovery ({FCD}) approaches. However, existing {FCD} methods may be limited by their potentially restrictive assumptions of identifiable functional causal models or homogeneous data distributions, narrowing their applicability in diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel {FCD} method attempting to accommodate arbitrary causal models and heterogeneous data. We first utilize a surrogate variable corresponding to the client index to account for the data heterogeneity across different clients. We then develop a federated conditional independence test ({FCIT}) for causal skeleton discovery and establish a federated independent change principle ({FICP}) to determine causal directions. These approaches involve constructing summary statistics as a proxy of the raw data to protect data privacy. Owing to the nonparametric properties, {FCIT} and {FICP} make no assumption about particular functional forms, thereby facilitating the handling of arbitrary causal models. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets to show the efficacy of our method.},

@inproceedings{li2024alleviating,
  abstract = {Diffusion Probabilistic Models ({DPM}) have shown remarkable efficacy in the synthesis of high-quality images. However, their inference process characteristically requires numerous, potentially hundreds, of iterative steps, which could exaggerate the problem of exposure bias due to the training and inference discrepancy. Previous work has attempted to mitigate this issue by perturbing inputs during training, which consequently mandates the retraining of the {DPM}. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of exposure bias in {DPM} and, intriguingly, we find that the exposure bias could be alleviated with a novel sampling method that we propose, without retraining the model. We theoretically and empirically show that by adjusting the next time step during sampling according to the approximated variance of the current generated samples, one can effectively alleviate the exposure bias. We propose a new sampling method called Time-Shift Sampler. The framework can be seamlessly integrated to existing sampling algorithms, such as {DDPM}, {DDIM} and other high-order solvers, inducing merely minimal additional computations. Experimental results show the method brings significant and consistent improvements in {FID} scores on different datasets and sampling methods. For example, integrating Time-Shift Sampler to {F-PNDM} yields a {FID}=3.88, achieving 44.49\% improvements as compared to {F-PNDM}, on {CIFAR}-10 with 10 sampling steps, which is more performant than the vanilla {DDIM} with 100 sampling steps.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization is a highly efficient approach to optimizing objective functions which are expensive to query. These objectives are typically represented by Gaussian process ({GP}) surrogate models which are easy to optimize and support exact inference. While standard {GP} surrogates have been well-established in Bayesian optimization, Bayesian neural networks ({BNN}s) have recently become practical function approximators, with many benefits over standard {GP}s such as the ability to naturally handle non-stationarity and learn representations for high-dimensional data. In this paper, we study {BNN}s as alternatives to standard {GP} surrogates for optimization. We consider a variety of approximate inference procedures for finite-width {BNN}s, including high-quality Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, low-cost stochastic {MCMC}, and heuristics such as deep ensembles. We also consider infinite-width {BNN}s, linearized Laplace approximations, and partially stochastic models such as deep kernel learning. We evaluate this collection of surrogate models on diverse problems with varying dimensionality, number of objectives, non-stationarity, and discrete and continuous inputs. Our key findings include: (i) the ranking of methods is highly problem dependent, suggesting the need for tailored inductive biases; (ii) {HMC} is the most successful approximate inference procedure for fully stochastic {BNN}s; (iii) full stochasticity may be unnecessary as deep kernel learning is relatively competitive; (iv) deep ensembles perform relatively poorly; (v) infinite-width {BNN}s are particularly promising, especially in high dimensions.},

However, this is not certain because some sequential models, such as Conditional Random Field ({CRF}), are free from this problem. To address this issue, we develop a theoretical framework to mathematically formulate error propagation in the architecture of {DM}s. The framework contains three elements, including modular error, cumulative error, and propagation equation. The modular and cumulative errors are related by the equation, which interprets that {DM}s are indeed affected by error propagation. Our theoretical study also suggests that the cumulative error is closely related to the generation quality of {DM}s. To alleviate the problem, we propose using cumulative error as an additional regularization term in the training objective. Experiments on toy examples, image generation, and speech synthesis show that our understanding and solution can improve the performance of diffusion models.},

While prompt-tuning has yielded continuous advancements in various tasks, such an approach still remains a persistent defect: prompt-tuning methods fail to generalize to specific few-shot patterns. From the perspective of distribution analyses, we disclose that the intrinsic issues behind the phenomenon are the over-multitudinous conceptual knowledge contained in {PLM}s and the abridged knowledge for target downstream domains, which jointly result in that {PLM}s mis-locate the knowledge distribution. To this end, we intuitively explore to approximate the unabridged target domains of downstream tasks in a debiased manner, and then abstract such domains to generate discriminative prompts, thereby providing the de-ambiguous guidance for {PLM}s. Guided by such an intuition, we propose a simple yet effective approach, namely {BayesPrompt}, to learn prompts that contain the domain discriminative information against the interference from domain-irrelevant knowledge. {BayesPrompt} primitively leverages known distributions to approximate the debiased factual distributions of target domains and further uniformly samples certain representative features from the approximated distributions to generate the ultimate prompts for {PLM}s. We provide theoretical insights with the connection to domain adaptation. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.},

This inconsistency between generating and validating an answer is prevalent in language models ({LM}s) and erodes trust. In this paper, we propose a framework for measuring the consistency between generation and validation (which we call generator-validator consistency, or {GV}-consistency), finding that even {GPT}-4 (0613), a state-of-the-art {LM}, is {GV}-consistent only 76\% of the time. To improve the consistency of {LM}s, we propose to finetune on the filtered generator and validator responses that are {GV}-consistent, and call this approach consistency fine-tuning. We find that this approach improves {GV}-consistency of Alpaca-30B from 60\% to 93\%, and the improvement extrapolates to unseen tasks and domains (e.g., {GV}-consistency for positive style transfers extrapolates to unseen styles like humor). In addition to improving consistency, consistency fine-tuning improves both generator quality and validator accuracy without using any labeled data.

In this paper, we introduce a more realistic attack scenario where victims collect data from multiple sources, and attackers cannot access the complete training data. We refer to this scenario as data-constrained backdoor attacks. In such cases, previous attack methods suffer from severe efficiency degradation due to the entanglement between benign and poisoning features during the backdoor injection process. We introduce three {CLIP}-based technologies from two distinct streams: Clean Feature Suppression, which aims to suppress the influence of clean features to enhance the prominence of poisoning features, and Poisoning Feature Augmentation, which focuses on augmenting the presence and impact of poisoning features to effectively manipulate the model's behavior. To evaluate the effectiveness, harmlessness to benign accuracy, and stealthiness of our method, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 target models, 3 datasets, and over 15 different settings.

  abstract = {Interactions among features are central to understanding the behavior of machine learning models. Recent research has made significant strides in detecting and quantifying feature interactions in single predictive models. However, we argue that the feature interactions extracted from a single pre-specified model may not be trustworthy since: a well-trained predictive model may not preserve the true feature interactions and there exist multiple well-performing predictive models that differ in feature interaction strengths. Thus, we recommend exploring feature interaction strengths in a model class of approximately equally accurate predictive models. In this work, we introduce the feature interaction score ({FIS}) in the context of a {Rashomon} set, representing a collection of models that achieve similar accuracy on a given task.},

Researchers have attempted to address the problem with machine learning and fragmentation-based methods. However, the two approaches fail to give a satisfactory description of long-range and many-body interactions, respectively. Inspired by fragmentation-based methods, we propose the Long-Short-Range Message-Passing ({LSR}-{MP}) framework as a generalization of the existing equivariant graph neural networks ({EGNN}s) with the intent to incorporate long-range interactions efficiently and effectively. We apply the {LSR}-{MP} framework to the recently proposed {ViSNet} and demonstrate the state-of-the-art results with up to 40\% {MAE} reduction for molecules in {MD}22 and {C}hignolin datasets. Consistent improvements to various {EGNN}s will also be discussed to illustrate the general applicability and robustness of our {LSR}-{MP} framework.},

Existing works usually assume that the input images are captured by a global shutter camera. Thus, rolling shutter ({RS}) images cannot be trivially applied to an off-the-shelf {NeRF} algorithm for novel view synthesis. Rolling shutter effect would also affect the accuracy of the camera pose estimation (e.g. via {COLMAP}), which further prevents the success of {NeRF} algorithm with {RS} images. In this paper, we propose Unrolling Shutter Bundle Adjusted Neural Radiance Fields ({USB}-{NeRF}). {USB}-{NeRF} is able to correct rolling shutter distortions and recover accurate camera motion trajectory simultaneously under the framework of {NeRF}, by modeling the physical image formation process of a {RS} camera. Experimental results demonstrate that {USB}-{NeRF} achieves better performance compared to prior works, in terms of {RS} effect removal, novel view image synthesis as well as camera motion estimation. Furthermore, our algorithm can also be used to recover high-fidelity high frame-rate global shutter video from a sequence of {RS} images.},

  abstract = {Federated learning has emerged as a promising distributed learning paradigm that facilitates collaborative learning among multiple parties without transferring raw data. However, most existing federated learning studies focus on either horizontal or vertical data settings, where the data of different parties are assumed to be from the same feature or sample space. In practice, a common scenario is the hybrid data setting, where data from different parties may differ both in the features and samples. To address this, we propose {H}ybrid{T}ree, a novel federated learning approach that enables federated tree learning on hybrid data. We observe the existence of consistent split rules in trees. With the help of these split rules, we theoretically show that the knowledge of parties can be incorporated into the lower layers of a tree. Based on our theoretical analysis, we propose a layer-level solution that does not need frequent communication traffic to train a tree. Our experiments demonstrate that {H}ybrid{T}ree can achieve comparable accuracy to the centralized setting with low computational and communication overhead. {H}ybrid{T}ree can achieve up to 8 times speedup compared with the other baselines.},

Many previous studies have focused on addressing selection bias to achieve unbiased learning of the prediction model, but ignore the fact that potential outcomes for a given user-item pair may vary with the treatments assigned to other user-item pairs, named neighborhood effect. To fill the gap, this paper formally formulates the neighborhood effect as an interference problem from the perspective of causal inference and introduces a treatment representation to capture the neighborhood effect. On this basis, we propose a novel ideal loss that can be used to deal with selection bias in the presence of neighborhood effect. We develop two estimators for the proposed ideal loss and theoretically establish the connection between the proposed and previous debiasing methods ignoring the neighborhood effect. We show that the proposed methods can achieve unbiased learning when both selection bias and neighborhood effects are present, while the existing methods are biased. Extensive semi-synthetic and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

Given practical computational budgets, targeting the original posterior can lead to suboptimal performance as samples may become trapped in bad modes and suffer from overfitting. We leverage the observation that good modes with low generalization error often reside in flat basins of the energy landscape, and propose to bias sampling on the posterior toward these flat regions. Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary guiding variable whose stationary distribution resembles a smoothed posterior free from sharp modes, to lead the MCMC sampler to flat basins.

The framework of curriculum learning trains agents using a sequence of related and more manageable source tasks, with the expectation that shared optimal decision rules across tasks can help agents learn necessary skills more quickly. However, despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of curriculum learning remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a causal framework for curriculum learning in RL. We formalize the notion of causally aligned source tasks that can effectively transfer knowledge to target tasks through shared causal mechanisms. Our theoretical analysis reveals conditions under which curriculum learning is guaranteed to improve sample efficiency, and we propose algorithms for automatically constructing effective curricula based on causal structure.

  abstract = {We present Chain-of-Knowledge (CoK), a novel framework that augments large language models (LLMs) by dynamically incorporating grounding information from heterogeneous sources, resulting in more factual rationales and reduced hallucination in generation. CoK consists of three stages: reasoning preparation, dynamic knowledge adapting, and answer consolidation. Given a knowledge-intensive question, CoK first prepares several preliminary rationales and answers while identifying the relevant knowledge domains. If there is no majority consensus among the answers from samples, CoK corrects the rationales step by step by adapting knowledge from the identified domains. These corrected rationales can plausibly serve as a better foundation for the final answer consolidation. Unlike prior studies that primarily use unstructured data, CoK also leverages structured knowledge sources such as Wikidata and tables that provide more reliable factual information. To access both unstructured and structured knowledge sources in the dynamic knowledge adapting stage, we propose an adaptive query generator that allows the generation of queries for various types of query languages, including SPARQL, SQL, and natural sentences. Moreover, to minimize error propagation between rationales, CoK corrects the rationales progressively using preceding corrected rationales to generate and correct subsequent rationales. Extensive experiments show that CoK consistently improves the performance of LLMs on knowledge-intensive tasks across different domains.},

Recently, there has been a surge of causal discovery methods that explicitly consider latent variables. While some works aim to reveal causal relations between observed variables in the presence of latent variables, others seek to identify latent variables and recover the causal structure over them. The latter typically entail strong distributional and graphical assumptions, such as the non-Gaussianity, purity, and two-pure-children assumption. In this paper, we endeavor to recover the whole causal structure involving both latent and observed variables under milder assumptions. We formulate two cases: one allows entirely arbitrary distributions and requires only one pure child per latent variable, while the other focuses on linear relationships under mild distributional assumptions. Our theoretical analysis shows that the proposed methods can successfully recover causal structures that previous methods could not identify due to their restrictive assumptions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.},

  abstract = {Current advancements in reinforcement learning ({RL}) have predominantly focused on learning step-based policies that generate actions for each perceived state. While these methods efficiently leverage step information from environmental interaction, they often ignore the temporal correlation between actions, resulting in inefficient exploration and unsmooth trajectories that are challenging to implement on real hardware. Episodic {RL} ({ERL}) seeks to overcome these challenges by exploring in parameters space that capture the correlation of actions. However, these approaches typically compromise data efficiency, as they treat trajectories as opaque black boxes. In this work, we introduce a novel {ERL} algorithm, Temporally-Correlated Episodic {RL} ({TCE}), which effectively utilizes step information in episodic policy updates, opening the `black box' in existing {ERL} methods while retaining the smooth and consistent exploration in parameter space. {TCE} synergistically combines the advantages of step-based and episodic {RL}, achieving comparable performance to recent {ERL} methods while maintaining data efficiency akin to state-of-the-art ({SoTA}) step-based {RL}.},

@inproceedings{li2024graph,
  abstract = {While contrastive self-supervised learning has become the de-facto learning paradigm for graph neural networks, the pursuit of higher task accuracy requires a larger hidden dimensionality to learn informative and discriminative full-precision representations, raising concerns about computation, memory footprint, and energy consumption burden (largely overlooked) for real-world applications. This work explores a promising direction for graph contrastive learning ({GCL}) with spiking neural networks ({SNNs}), which leverage sparse and binary characteristics to learn more biologically plausible and compact representations. We propose {SpikeGCL}, a novel {GCL} framework to learn binarized 1-bit representations for graphs, making balanced trade-offs between efficiency and performance. We provide theoretical guarantees to demonstrate that {SpikeGCL} has comparable expressiveness with its full-precision counterparts. Experimental results demonstrate that, with nearly 32x representation storage compression, {SpikeGCL} is either comparable to or outperforms many fancy state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised methods across several graph benchmarks.},

@inproceedings{li2024debiased,
  abstract = {Collaborative filtering builds personalized models from the collected user feedback. However, the collected data is observational rather than experimental, leading to various biases in the data, which can significantly affect the learned model. To address this issue, many studies have focused on propensity-based methods to combat the selection bias by reweighting the sample loss, and demonstrate that balancing is important for debiasing both theoretically and empirically. However, there are two questions that still need to be addressed: which function class should be balanced and how to effectively balance that function class? In this paper, we first perform theoretical analysis to show the effect of balancing finite-dimensional function classes on the bias of {IPS} and {DR} methods, and based on this, we propose a universal kernel-based balancing method to balance functions on the reproducing kernel {Hilbert} space. In addition, we propose a novel adaptive causal balancing method during the alternating update between unbiased evaluation and training of the prediction model. Specifically, the prediction loss of the model is projected in the kernel-based covariate function space, and the projection coefficients are used to determine which functions should be prioritized for balancing to reduce the estimation bias. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks ({GNNs}) have been widely adopted for drug discovery with molecular graphs. Nevertheless, current {GNNs} mainly excel in leveraging short-range interactions ({SRI}) but struggle to capture long-range interactions ({LRI}), both of which are crucial for determining molecular properties. In this work, we propose to abstract collective information of atomic groups into {Neural} {Atoms} by implicitly projecting atoms of a molecule. We explicitly exchange information among neural atoms and project them back to atoms' representations as enhancement. Such a mechanism establishes communication channels among distant nodes, effectively reducing the interaction scope of arbitrary node pairs into a single hop. Theoretical analysis reveals the connection with the traditional {LRI} calculation method, {Ewald} {Summation}, which enhances {GNNs} to capture {LRI} by approximating the potential {LRI} of molecules. Extensive experiments on four long-range graph benchmarks covering graph-level and link-level tasks on molecular graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving up to 27.32\% and 38.27\% improvement in 2{D} and 3{D} scenarios respectively. The {Neural} {Atom} can be equipped with arbitrary {GNNs} to help capture {LRI}.},

@inproceedings{li2024adaptive,
  abstract = {Local motion blur commonly occurs in real-world photography due to the mixing between moving objects and stationary backgrounds during exposure. Existing image deblurring methods predominantly focus on global deblurring, inadvertently affecting the sharpness of backgrounds in locally blurred images and wasting unnecessary computation on sharp pixels, especially for high-resolution images. This paper aims to adaptively and efficiently restore high-resolution locally blurred images. We propose a local motion deblurring vision {Transformer} ({LMD}-{ViT}) built on adaptive window pruning {Transformer} blocks ({AdaWPT}). To focus deblurring on local regions and reduce computation, {AdaWPT} prunes unnecessary windows, only allowing the active windows to be involved in the deblurring processes. The pruning operation relies on the blurriness confidence predicted by a confidence predictor that is trained end-to-end using a reconstruction loss with {Gumbel}-{Softmax} re-parameterization and a pruning loss guided by annotated blur masks. Our method removes local motion blur effectively without distorting sharp regions, demonstrated by its exceptional perceptual and quantitative improvements (+0.28{dB}) compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, our approach substantially reduces {FLOPs} by 66\% and achieves more than a twofold increase in inference speed compared to {Transformer}-based deblurring methods. We will make our code and annotated blur masks publicly available.},

However, current models still struggle with intricate spatiotemporal prompts and often generate restricted or incorrect motion. To address these limitations, we introduce {LLM}-grounded Video Diffusion ({LVD}). Instead of directly generating videos from the text inputs, {LVD} first leverages a large language model ({LLM}) to generate dynamic scene layouts based on the text inputs and subsequently uses the generated layouts to guide a diffusion model for video generation. We show that {LLMs} are able to understand complex spatiotemporal dynamics from text alone and generate layouts that align closely with both the prompts and the object motion patterns typically observed in the real world. We then propose to guide video diffusion models with these layouts by adjusting the attention maps. Our approach is training-free and can be integrated into any video diffusion model that admits classifier guidance. Our results demonstrate that {LVD} significantly outperforms its base video diffusion model and several strong baseline methods in faithfully generating videos with the desired attributes and motion patterns.},

@inproceedings{liang2024generative,
  abstract = {By employing neural networks ({NN}) to learn input-solution mappings and passing a new input through the learned mapping to obtain a solution instantly, recent studies have shown remarkable speed improvements over iterative algorithms for solving optimization problems. Meanwhile, they also highlight methodological challenges to be addressed. In particular, general non-convex problems often present multiple optimal solutions for identical inputs, signifying a complex, multi-valued input-solution mapping. Conventional learning techniques, primarily tailored to learn single-valued mappings, struggle to train {NNs} to accurately decipher multi-valued ones, leading to inferior solutions. We address this fundamental issue by developing a generative learning approach using a rectified flow ({RectFlow}) model built upon ordinary differential equations. In contrast to learning input-solution mapping, we learn the mapping from input to solution distribution, exploiting the universal approximation capability of the {RectFlow} model. Upon receiving a new input, we employ the trained {RectFlow} model to sample high-quality solutions from the input-dependent distribution it has learned. Our approach outperforms conceivable {GAN} and Diffusion models in terms of training stability and run-time complexity. We provide a detailed characterization of the optimality loss and runtime complexity associated with our generative approach. Simulation results for solving non-convex problems show that our method achieves significantly better solution optimality than recent {NN} schemes, with comparable feasibility and speedup performance.},

  abstract = {In many machine learning systems that jointly learn from multiple modalities, a core research question is to understand the nature of multimodal interactions: how modalities combine to provide new task-relevant information that was not present in either alone. We study this question of interaction quantification under a semi-supervised setting with only labeled unimodal data and naturally co-occurring multimodal data (e.g., unlabeled images and captions, video and corresponding audio). Using a precise information-theoretic definition of interactions, we derive lower and upper bounds to quantify the amount of multimodal interactions in this semi-supervised setting. We propose two lower bounds based on 1) shared information between modalities and 2) disagreement between separately trained unimodal classifiers, and derive an upper bound through connections to approximate algorithms for min-entropy couplings. We show how these theoretical results can be used to estimate multimodal model performance, guide data collection, and select appropriate multimodal models for various tasks. Empirical validation across {ImageNet}, {PASCAL} {VOC}, {ModelNet40}, and five multimodal sentiment analysis datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our bounds.},

@inproceedings{liang2024poisoned,
  abstract = {The proliferation of face forgery techniques has raised significant concerns within society, thereby motivating the development of face forgery detection methods. These methods aim to distinguish forged faces from genuine ones and have proven effective in practical applications. However, this paper introduces a novel and previously unrecognized threat in face forgery detection scenarios caused by backdoor attack. By embedding backdoors into models and incorporating specific trigger patterns into the input, attackers can deceive detectors into producing erroneous predictions for forged faces. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes \emph{Poisoned Forgery Face} framework, which enables clean-label backdoor attacks on face forgery detectors. Our approach involves constructing a scalable trigger generator and utilizing a novel convolving process to generate translation-sensitive trigger patterns. Moreover, we employ a relative embedding method based on landmark-based regions to enhance the stealthiness of the poisoned samples. Consequently, detectors trained on our poisoned samples are embedded with backdoors. Notably, our approach surpasses {SoTA} backdoor baselines with a significant improvement in attack success rate (+16.39\% {BD}-{AUC}) and reduction in visibility (-12.65\% $L_\infty$). Furthermore, our attack exhibits promising performance against backdoor defenses. We anticipate that this paper will draw greater attention to the potential threats posed by backdoor attacks in face forgery detection scenarios.

More critically, we reveal that the entire literature on label poisoning for {GNNs} is plagued by serious evaluation pitfalls. Thus making it hard to conclude how robust {GNNs} are against label perturbations. After course correcting the state of label poisoning attacks with our faithful evaluation, we identify a discrepancy in attack efficiency of ~9\% on average.

@inproceedings{liu2024how,
  abstract = {In theoretical neuroscience, recent work leverages deep learning tools to explore how some network attributes critically influence its learning dynamics. Notably, initial weight distributions with small (resp. large) variance may yield a rich (resp. lazy) regime, where significant (resp. minor) changes to network states and representation are observed over the course of learning. However, in biology, neural circuit connectivity generally has a low-rank structure and therefore differs markedly from the random initializations generally used for these studies. As such, here we investigate how the structure of the initial weights — in particular their effective rank — influences the network learning regime. Through both empirical and theoretical analyses, we discover that high-rank initializations typically yield smaller network changes indicative of lazier learning, a finding we also confirm with experimentally-driven initial connectivity in recurrent neural networks. Conversely, low-rank initialization biases learning towards richer learning.

  abstract = {High accuracy, low latency and high energy efficiency represent a set of contradictory goals when searching for system solutions for image classification and detection. While high-quality images naturally result in more precise detection and classification, they also result in a heavier computational workload for imaging and processing, reduce camera refresh rates, and increase the volume of data communication between the camera and processor. Taking inspiration from the foveal-peripheral sampling mechanism, saccade mechanism observed in the human visual system and the filling-in phenomena, this model stitches together information from foveal and peripheral vision, which are sampled from multiple glances. Assisted by a reinforcement learning-based saccade mechanism, our model reduces the required input pixels by over 90% per frame while maintaining the same level of performance in image recognition as with the original images. We evaluated the effectiveness of our model using the GTSRB dataset and the ImageNet dataset. Using an equal number of input pixels, our study demonstrates a 5% higher image recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art foveal-peripheral vision systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our foveal sampling/saccadic scene reconstruction model exhibits significantly lower complexity and higher data efficiency during the training phase compared to existing approaches.},

Our framework, planning abstraction from language (PARL), utilizes language-annotated demonstrations to automatically discover a symbolic and abstract action space and induce a latent state abstraction based on it. PARL consists of three stages: 1) recovering object-level and action concepts, 2) learning state abstractions, abstract action feasibility, and transition models, and 3) applying low-level policies for abstract actions. During inference, given the task description, PARL first makes abstract action plans using the latent transition and feasibility functions, then refines the high-level plan using low-level policies. PARL generalizes across scenarios involving novel object instances and environments, unseen concept compositions, and tasks that require longer planning horizons than settings it is trained on.},

  abstract = {Most existing works focus on direct perturbations to the victim's state/action or the underlying transition dynamics to demonstrate the vulnerability of reinforcement learning agents to adversarial attacks. However, such direct manipulations may not be always realizable. In this paper, we consider a multi-agent setting where a well-trained victim agent ν is exploited by an attacker controlling another agent α with an adversarial policy. Previous models do not account for the possibility that the attacker may only have partial control over α or that the attack may produce easily detectable "abnormal" behaviors. Furthermore, there is a lack of provably efficient defenses against these adversarial policies. In this work, we introduce a generalized attack framework that has the flexibility to model to what extent the adversary is able to control the agent, and allows the attacker to regulate the state distribution shift and produce stealthier adversarial policies. We offer a provably efficient defense with polynomial convergence to the most robust victim policy through adversarial training with timescale separation. This stands in sharp contrast to supervised learning, where adversarial training typically provides only empirical defenses. Using the Robosumo competition experiments, we show that our generalized attack formulation results in much stealthier adversarial policies when maintaining the same winning rate as baselines. Additionally, our adversarial training approach yields stable learning dynamics and less exploitable victim policies.},

Classical planning excels at addressing hierarchical tasks by employing symbolic knowledge, yet most of the methods rely on assumptions about pre-defined subtasks. To bridge the best of both worlds, we propose a framework that integrates DRL with classical planning by automatically inducing task structures and substructures from a few demonstrations. Specifically, we adopt abstraction mapping formulation and define critical actions that lead to the transition at the abstraction level. Then, we propose to induce critical action schemata regarded as subtasks by employing genetic programming where the program model reflects prior domain knowledge of effect rules.

However, their generalization ability is limited by the inadequate consideration of physical inductive biases: (1) Existing studies overlook the continuity of transitions among system states, opting to employ several discrete transformation layers to learn the direct mapping between two adjacent states; (2) Most models only account for first-order velocity information, despite the fact that many physical systems are governed by second-order motion laws. Different from previous models that use Equiv-GNNs to fit discrete kinematic states, we introduce the second-order equivariant graph neural ordinary differential equation (SEGNO), which employs Neural ODEs to approximate a continuous trajectory between two observed states and incorporates second-order motion equations to better estimate the underlying dynamics. Theoretically, we prove the uniqueness of the learned latent trajectory of SEGNO and further provide an upper bound on the discrepancy between the learned and the actual latent trajectory. Extensive experiments on complex dynamical systems including molecular dynamics and motion capture demonstrate that SEGNO yields a significant improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.},

For robotic agents, learning from the plethora of unlabeled video demonstration data available on the Internet necessitates imitating the expert without access to its action, presenting a challenge known as Imitation Learning from Observations (ILfO). A common approach to tackle ILfO problems is to convert them into inverse reinforcement learning problems, utilizing a proxy reward computed from the agent's and the expert's observations. Nonetheless, we identify that tasks characterized by a progress dependency property pose significant challenges for such approaches; in these tasks, the agent needs to initially learn the expert's preceding behaviors before mastering the subsequent ones. Our investigation reveals that the main cause is that the reward signals assigned to later steps hinder the learning of initial behaviors. To address this challenge, we introduce an Automatic Discount Scheduling (ADS) mechanism that adaptively alters the discount factor in reinforcement learning during the training phase, prioritizing earlier rewards initially and gradually engaging later rewards only when the earlier behaviors have been mastered.},

In comparison to SOTA transformer-based models within the ANN domain on the SCv2 dataset, our LMUFormer demonstrates comparable performance while necessitating a remarkable 53 times reduction in parameters and a substantial 65 times decrement in FLOPs. Furthermore, when benchmarked against extant low-complexity SNN variants, our model establishes a new SOTA with an accuracy of 96.12%.

From the online learning perspective, a Follow-The-Leader (FTL) world model is desirable, which optimally fits all previous experiences at each round. Unfortunately, NN-based models need re-training on all accumulated data at every interaction step to achieve FTL, which is computationally expensive for lifelong agents. In this paper, we revisit models that can achieve FTL with incremental updates. Specifically, our world model is a linear regression model supported by nonlinear random features. The linear part ensures efficient FTL update while the nonlinear random feature empowers the fitting of complex environments. To best trade off model capacity and computation efficiency, we introduce a locality sensitive sparse encoding, which allows us to conduct efficient sparse updates even with very high dimensional nonlinear features. We validate the representation power of our encoding and verify that it allows efficient online learning under data covariate shift. We also show, in the Dyna MBRL setting, that our world models learned online using a single pass of trajectory data either surpass or match the performance of deep world models trained with replay and other continual learning methods.},

However, such presolvers in existing literature or open-source solvers are mostly set by default agnostic to specific input instances, and few studies have been reported on tailoring presolving settings. In this paper, we aim to dive into this open question and show that the MIP solver can be indeed largely improved when switching the default instance-agnostic presolving into instance-specific presolving. Specifically, we propose a combination of supervised learning and classic heuristics to achieve efficient presolving adjusting, avoiding tedious reinforcement learning. Notably, our approach is orthogonal from many recent efforts in incorporating learning modules into the B\&B framework after the presolving stage, and to our best knowledge, this is the first work for introducing learning to presolve in MIP solvers. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that well-trained neural networks can infer proper presolving for arbitrary incoming MIP instances in less than 0.5s, which is neglectable compared with the solving time often hours or days.},

  abstract = {In light of the burgeoning success of reinforcement learning (RL) in diverse real-world applications, considerable focus has been directed towards ensuring RL policies are robust to adversarial attacks during test time. Current approaches largely revolve around solving a minimax problem to prepare for potential worst-case scenarios. While effective against strong attacks, these methods often compromise performance in the absence of attacks or the presence of only weak attacks. To address this, we study policy robustness under the well-accepted state-adversarial attack model, extending our focus beyond merely worst-case attacks. We first formalize this task at test time as a regret minimization problem and establish its intrinsic difficulty in achieving sublinear regret when the baseline policy is from a general continuous policy class, $\Pi$. This finding prompts us to refine the baseline policy class $\Pi$ prior to test time, aiming for efficient adaptation within a compact, finite policy class $\tilde{\Pi}$, which can resort to an adversarial bandit subroutine. In light of the importance of a finite and compact $\tilde{\Pi}$, we propose a novel training-time algorithm to iteratively discover non-dominated policies, forming a near-optimal and minimal $\tilde{\Pi}$, thereby ensuring both robustness and test-time efficiency. Empirical validation on the Mujoco corroborates the superiority of our approach in terms of natural and robust performance, as well as adaptability to various attack scenarios.},

For this, meshes are appealing since they enable 1) fast physics-based rendering with realistic material and lighting, 2) physical simulation, and 3) are memory-efficient for modern graphics pipelines. Recent work on reconstructing and statistically modeling 3D shape, however, has critiqued meshes as being topologically inflexible. To capture a wide range of object shapes, any 3D representation must be able to model solid, watertight, shapes as well as thin, open, surfaces. Recent work has focused on the former, and methods for reconstructing open surfaces do not support fast reconstruction with material and lighting or unconditional generative modelling. Inspired by the observation that open surfaces can be seen as islands floating on watertight surfaces, we parametrize open surfaces by defining a manifold signed distance field on watertight templates. With this parametrization, we further develop a grid-based and differentiable representation that parametrizes both watertight and non-watertight meshes of arbitrary topology. Our new representation, called Ghost-on-the-Shell (G-Shell), enables two important applications: differentiable rasterization-based reconstruction from multiview images and generative modelling of non-watertight meshes. We empirically demonstrate that G-Shell achieves state-of-the-art performance on non-watertight mesh reconstruction and generation tasks, while also performing effectively for watertight meshes.},

  abstract = {Quantizing large language models (LLMs) is one of the most effective approaches to improve inference efficiency, which has been greatly promoted by the recent advance in post-training quantization (PTQ). However, the existing PTQ methods still suffer from low accuracy at low-bitwidth. We identify the activation outliers in particular channels as the bottleneck to PTQ accuracy. Although existing methods that transform magnitudes from activations to weights offer limited alleviation or suffer from unstable gradients, resulting in severe performance drop at low-bitwidth. To tackle this problem, we propose QLLM, an accurate and efficient low-bitwidth PTQ method for LLMs. QLLM introduces an adaptive channel reassembly technique that reallocates the magnitude of outliers to other channels, thereby mitigating their impact on the quantization range. Specifically, the channel disassembly breaks down the outlier channels into several sub-channels to ensure a more balanced distribution of activation magnitudes, then similar channels are merged to maintain the original channel number for efficiency. Additionally, an adaptive strategy is designed to autonomously determine the optimal number of sub-channels for channel disassembly. To further compensate for the performance loss caused by quantization, we propose an efficient tuning method that only learns a small number of low-rank weights while freezing the pre-trained quantized model. After training, these low-rank parameters can be fused into the frozen weights without affecting inference. Extensive experiments show that QLLM outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 7.89% on the average accuracy across five zero-shot tasks. Moreover, QLLM quantizes the 4-bit LLaMA-2-70B within 10 hours on a single A100-80G GPU.},

These forecasters leverage Transformers to model the global dependencies over temporal tokens of time series, with each token formed by multiple variates of the same timestamp. However, Transformers are challenged in forecasting series with larger lookback windows due to performance degradation and computation explosion. In response, we propose iTransformer, that simply applies the attention and feed-forward network on the inverted dimensions. Specifically, the time points of individual series are embedded into variate tokens which are utilized by the attention mechanism to capture multivariate correlations; meanwhile, the feed-forward network is applied for each variate token to learn nonlinear representations. The iTransformer model achieves state-of-the-art on challenging real-world datasets and shows that the Transformer architecture can be simply repurposed for effective time series forecasting beyond the vanilla attention over temporal tokens. We further provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence that iTransformer better utilizes the attention mechanism for time series representation learning.},

@inproceedings{liu2024discovering,
  abstract = {Text-guided diffusion models (TDMs) are widely applied but can fail unexpectedly. Common failures include natural-looking text prompts generating images with wrong content, or different random samples of the latent variables that generate vastly different outputs despite being conditioned on the same text prompt. To study and understand these failure modes in more detail, we propose SAGE, the first adversarial search method on TDMs that systematically explores the discrete prompt space and the high-dimensional latent space, to automatically discover undesirable behaviors and failure cases in image generation. We use image classifiers as surrogate loss functions during searching, and employ human inspection to validate the identified failures. For the first time, our method enables efficient exploration of both the discrete and intricate human language space and the challenging latent space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAGE on five widely used generative models and reveal four typical failure modes: (1) We find a variety of natural text prompts that are natural and easily understood by humans but not by the SOTA diffusion models. (2) We find latent samples that consistently lead to distorted images under various commonly used prompts. (3) We find latent samples that generate objects commonly associated with the key object, rather than generating the key object class itself. (4) We find universal token embeddings that cause irrelevant images across various input prompts. Our findings provide insights into the underlying mechanisms and potential limitations of TDMs and pave the way for more robust and reliable text-guided generative models.},

Given an erroneous interaction sequence, the objective is to refine the incorrect hand trajectory to remove interaction artifacts for a perceptually realistic sequence. This challenge involves intricate interaction noise, including unnatural hand poses and incorrect hand-object relations, alongside the necessity for robust generalization to new interactions and diverse noise patterns. We tackle those challenges through a novel approach, {GeneOH Diffusion}, incorporating two key designs: an innovative contact-centric {HOI} representation named {GeneOH} and a new domain-generalizable denoising scheme.},

However, pseudo labels can be noisy and the updated model parameters are unreliable under dynamic data distributions, leading to error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting in the continual adaptation process. To address these challenges, we design homeostatic low-rank and high-rank Visual Domain Adapters ({ViDA}) for {CTTA}, which explicitly handle both domain-specific and domain-shared knowledge. We comprehensively explore the different domain representations of the adapters with trainable high-rank or low-rank embedding spaces. A Homeostatic Knowledge Allotment ({HKA}) strategy is proposed, which adaptively combines different knowledge from each {ViDA}.},

Nonetheless, most existing {MARL} algorithms are model-free, limiting sample efficiency and hindering their applicability in more challenging scenarios. In contrast, model-based reinforcement learning ({MBRL}), particularly algorithms integrating planning, such as {MuZero}, has demonstrated superhuman performance with limited data in many tasks. Hence, we aim to boost the sample efficiency of {MARL} by adopting model-based approaches. However, incorporating planning and search methods into multi-agent systems poses significant challenges. The expansive action space of multi-agent systems often necessitates leveraging the nearly-independent property of agents to accelerate learning. To tackle this issue, we propose the {MAZero} algorithm, which combines a centralized model with Monte Carlo Tree Search ({MCTS}) for policy search.},

Recently, a generalization result was provided for zeroth-order stochastic gradient descent ({SGD}) algorithms through stability analysis. However, this result was limited to the vanilla 2-point zeroth-order estimate of {Gaussian} distribution used in {SGD} algorithms. To address these limitations, we propose a general proof framework for stability analysis that applies to convex, strongly convex, and non-convex conditions, and yields results for popular zeroth-order optimization algorithms, including {SGD}, {GD}, and {SVRG}, as well as various zeroth-order estimates, such as 1-point and 2-point with different distributions and coordinate estimates.},

So far, however, the convergence speed and sample complexity performances of most existing policy evaluation algorithms remain unsatisfactory, particularly with non-linear function approximation. This challenge motivates us to develop a new path-integrated primal-dual stochastic gradient (PILOT) method, that is able to achieve a fast convergence speed for RL policy evaluation with nonlinear function approximation. To further alleviate the periodic full gradient evaluation requirement, we further propose an enhanced method with an adaptive-batch adjustment called PILOT$^+$. The main advantages of our methods include: (i) PILOT allows the use of constant step sizes and achieves the O(1/K) convergence rate to first-order stationary points of non-convex policy evaluation problems; (ii) PILOT is a generic single-timescale algorithm that unifies policy evaluation in both on-policy and off-policy settings.},

@inproceedings{liu2024revisiting,
  abstract = {In the past several years, the last-iterate convergence of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm has triggered people's interest due to its good performance in practice but lack of theoretical understanding. For Lipschitz convex functions, different works have established the optimal $O(\log(1/\delta)\log T/\sqrt{T})$ or $O(\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)/T})$ high-probability convergence rates for the final iterate, where $T$ is the time horizon and $\delta$ is the failure probability. However, to prove these bounds, all the existing works are either limited to compact domains or require almost surely bounded noises. It is natural to ask whether the last iterate of SGD can still guarantee the optimal convergence rate but without these two restrictive assumptions. In this work, we revisit the last-iterate convergence of stochastic gradient methods and provide the first unified way to prove the convergence rates both in expectation and in high probability to accommodate general domains, composite objectives, non-Euclidean norms, Lipschitz conditions, smoothness, and (strong) convexity simultaneously. Additionally, we extend our analysis to obtain the last-iterate convergence under heavy-tailed noises.},

However, if these algorithms are trained solely to minimize training/test errors, they may inadvertently discriminate against individuals based on their sensitive attributes, such as gender, race or age. Recently, algorithms that ensure the fairness are developed in the machine learning community. Fairness criteria are applied by these algorithms to measure the fairness, but they often use the point estimate to assess the fairness and fail to consider the uncertainty of the sample fairness criterion once the algorithms are deployed. We suggest that assessing the fairness should take the uncertainty into account.

@inproceedings{panwar2024incontext,
  abstract = {In-context learning (ICL) is one of the surprising and useful features of large language models and subject of intense research. Recently, stylized meta-learning-like ICL setups have been devised that train transformers on sequences of input-output pairs $(x, f(x))$. The function $f$ comes from a function class and generalization is checked by evaluating on sequences generated from unseen functions from the same class. One of the main discoveries in this line of research has been that for several function classes, such as linear regression, transformers successfully generalize to new functions in the class. However, the inductive biases of these models resulting in this behavior are not clearly understood. A model with unlimited training data and compute is a Bayesian predictor: it learns the pretraining distribution. The Bayesian perspective provides insights into the inductive bias of ICL and how transformers perform a particular task when they are trained on multiple tasks and it is found that transformers can learn to generalize to new function classes that were not seen during pretraining.},

  abstract = {Daily internet communication relies heavily on tree-structured graphs, embodied by popular data formats such as XML and JSON. However, many recent generative (probabilistic) models utilize neural networks to learn a probability distribution over undirected cyclic graphs. This assumption of a generic graph structure brings various computational challenges, and, more importantly, the presence of non-linearities in neural networks does not permit tractable probabilistic inference. We address these problems by proposing sum-product-set networks, an extension of probabilistic circuits from unstructured tensor data to tree-structured graph data. To this end, we use random finite sets to reflect a variable number of nodes and edges in the graph and to allow for exact and efficient inference. We demonstrate that our tractable model performs comparably to various intractable models based on neural networks.},

AD always outputs the correct derivative if a program does not use any non-differentiable functions and control flows; however, it may return an arbitrary value otherwise. In this work, we investigate what AD computes for neural networks that may contain non-differentiable functions such as ReLU and maxpools. We first prove that AD always returns a generalized derivative called a Clarke subderivative for networks with pointwise activation functions, if the minibatch size is one and all non-differentiable neurons have distinct bias parameters. We show that the same conclusion does not hold otherwise, but does hold under some mild sufficient conditions. We also prove similar results for more general networks that can use maxpools and bias parameters shared across different neurons. We empirically check our sufficient conditions over popular network architectures and observe that AD almost always computes a Clarke subderivative in practical learning setups.},

However, such prior works show limited performance in discovering and representing the symbolic structure from unseen test data because their decomposition to the structural representations was incomplete. In this work, we propose an Attention-based Iterative Decomposition (AID) module designed to enhance the decomposition operations for the structured representations encoded from the sequential input data with TPR. Our AID can be easily adapted to any TPR-based model and provides enhanced systematic decomposition through a competitive attention mechanism between input features and structured representations. In our experiments, AID shows effectiveness by significantly improving the performance of TPR-based prior works on the series of systematic generalization tasks. Moreover, in the quantitative and qualitative evaluations, AID produces more compositional and well-bound structural representations than other works.},

Retraining-free structured pruning algorithms are crucial in pretrained language model compression due to their significantly reduced pruning cost and capability to prune large language models. However, existing retraining-free algorithms encounter severe accuracy degradation, as they fail to handle pruning errors, especially at high compression rates. In this paper, we propose KPrune (Knowledge-preserving pruning), an accurate retraining-free structured pruning algorithm for pretrained encoder-based language models. KPrune focuses on preserving the useful knowledge of the pretrained model to minimize pruning errors through a carefully designed iterative pruning process composed of knowledge measurement, knowledge-preserving mask search, and knowledge-preserving weight-tuning. As a result, KPrune shows significant accuracy improvements up to 58.02\%p higher F1 score compared to existing retraining-free pruning algorithms under a high compression rate of 80\% on the SQuAD benchmark without any retraining process.},

Existing methods, which rely on sliding windows to process long sequences, struggle to effectively capture long-term variations that are partially caught within the short window (i.e., outer-window variations). In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that overcomes this limitation by employing contrastive learning and enhanced decomposition architecture, specifically designed to focus on long-term variations. To this end, our contrastive loss incorporates global autocorrelation held in the whole time series, which facilitates the construction of positive and negative pairs in a self-supervised manner. When combined with our decomposition networks, our contrastive learning significantly improves long-term forecasting performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms 14 baseline models in multiple experiments over nine long-term benchmarks, especially in challenging scenarios that require a significantly long output for forecasting.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have introduced a new class of generative models for synthesizing implicit neural representations (INRs) that capture arbitrary continuous signals in various domains. These models opened the door for domain-agnostic generative models, but they often fail to achieve high-quality generation. We observed that the existing methods generate the weights of neural networks to parameterize INRs and evaluate the network with fixed positional embeddings (PEs). Arguably, this architecture limits the expressive power of generative models and results in low-quality INR generation. To address this limitation, we propose Domain-agnostic Latent Diffusion Model for INRs (DDMI) that generates adaptive positional embeddings instead of neural networks' weights. Specifically, we develop a Discrete-to-continuous space Variational AutoEncoder (D2C-VAE) that seamlessly connects discrete data and continuous signal functions in the shared latent space. Additionally, we introduce a novel conditioning mechanism for evaluating INRs with the hierarchically decomposed PEs to further enhance expressive power. Extensive experiments across four modalities, e.g., 2D images, 3D shapes, Neural Radiance Fields, and videos, with seven benchmark datasets, demonstrate the versatility of DDMI and its superior performance compared to the existing INR generative models.},

@inproceedings{park2024ednerf,
  abstract = {Recently, there has been a significant advancement in text-to-image diffusion models, leading to groundbreaking performance in 2D image generation. These advancements have been extended to 3D models, enabling the generation of novel 3D objects from textual descriptions. This has evolved into NeRF editing methods, which allow the manipulation of existing 3D objects through textual conditioning. However, existing NeRF editing techniques have faced limitations in their performance due to slow training speeds and the use of loss functions that do not adequately consider editing. To address this, here we present a novel 3D NeRF editing approach dubbed ED-NeRF by successfully embedding real-world scenes into the latent space of the latent diffusion model (LDM) through a unique refinement layer. This approach enables us to obtain a NeRF backbone that is not only faster but also more amenable to editing compared to traditional image space NeRF editing. Furthermore, we propose an improved loss function tailored for editing by migrating the delta denoising score (DDS) distillation loss, originally used in 2D image editing to the three-dimensional domain. This novel loss function surpasses the well-known score distillation sampling (SDS) loss in terms of suitability for editing purposes. Our experimental results demonstrate that ED-NeRF achieves faster editing speed while producing improved output quality compared to state-of-the-art 3D editing models.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces VLAP, a novel approach that bridges pretrained vision models and large language models (LLMs) to make frozen LLMs understand the visual world. VLAP transforms the embedding space of pretrained vision models into the LLMs' word embedding space using a single linear layer for efficient and general-purpose visual and language understanding. Specifically, we harness well-established word embeddings to bridge two modality embedding spaces. The visual and text representations are simultaneously assigned to a set of word embeddings within pretrained LLMs by formulating the assigning procedure as an optimal transport problem. We predict the assignment of one modality from the representation of another modality data, enforcing consistent assignments for paired multimodal data. This allows vision and language representations to contain the same information, grounding the frozen LLMs' word embedding space in visual data. Moreover, a robust semantic taxonomy of LLMs can be preserved with visual data since the LLMs interpret and reason linguistic information from correlations between word embeddings. Experimental results show that VLAP achieves substantial improvements over the previous linear transformation-based approaches across a range of vision-language tasks, including image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval. We also demonstrate the learned visual representations hold a semantic taxonomy of LLMs, making visual semantic arithmetic possible.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in self-supervised learning and the Transformer architecture have significantly improved natural language processing (NLP), achieving remarkably low perplexity. However, the growing size of NLP models introduces a memory wall problem during the generation phase. To mitigate this issue, recent efforts have focused on quantizing model weights to sub-4-bit precision while preserving full precision for activations, resulting in practical speed-ups during inference on a single GPU. However, these improvements primarily stem from reduced memory movement, which necessitates a resource-intensive dequantization process rather than actual computational reduction. In this paper, we introduce LUT-GEMM, an efficient kernel for quantized matrix multiplication, which not only eliminates the resource-intensive dequantization process but also reduces computational costs compared to previous kernels for weight-only quantization. Furthermore, we proposed group-wise quantization to offer a flexible trade-off between compression ratio and accuracy. The impact of LUT-GEMM is facilitated by implementing high compression ratios through low-bit quantization and efficient LUT-based operations. We show experimentally that when applied to the OPT-175B model with 3-bit quantization, LUT-GEMM substantially accelerates token generation latency, achieving a remarkable 2.1x improvement on a single GPU when compared to OPTQ, which relies on the costly dequantization process.},

  abstract = {Unsupervised pre-training strategies have proven to be highly effective in natural language processing and computer vision. Likewise, unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) holds the promise of discovering a variety of potentially useful behaviors that can accelerate the learning of a wide array of downstream tasks. Previous unsupervised RL approaches have mainly focused on pure exploration and mutual information skill learning. However, despite the previous attempts, making unsupervised RL truly scalable still remains a major open challenge: pure exploration approaches might struggle in complex environments with large state spaces, where covering every possible transition is infeasible, and mutual information skill learning approaches might completely fail to explore the environment due to the lack of incentives. To make unsupervised RL scalable to complex, high-dimensional environments, we propose a novel unsupervised RL objective, which we call Metric-Aware Abstraction (METRA). Our main idea is, instead of directly covering the entire state space, to only cover a compact latent space $\mathcal{Z}$ that is metrically connected to the state space $\mathcal{S}$ by temporal distances. By learning to move in every direction in the latent space, METRA obtains a tractable set of diverse behaviors that approximately cover the state space, being scalable to high-dimensional environments. Through our experiments in five locomotion and manipulation environments, we demonstrate that METRA can discover a variety of useful behaviors even in complex, pixel-based environments, being the first unsupervised RL method that discovers diverse locomotion behaviors in pixel-based Quadruped and Humanoid.

  abstract = {In the face of escalating climate changes, typhoon intensities and their ensuing damage have surged. Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for effective damage control. Traditional physics-based models, while comprehensive, are computationally intensive and rely heavily on the expertise of forecasters. Contemporary data-driven methods often rely on reanalysis data, which can be considered to be the closest to the true representation of weather conditions. However, reanalysis data is not produced in real-time and requires time for adjustment since prediction models are calibrated with observational data. This reanalysis data, such as ERA5, falls short in challenging real-world situations. Optimal preparedness necessitates predictions at least 72 hours in advance, beyond the capabilities of standard physics models. In response to these constraints, we present an approach that harnesses real-time Unified Model (UM) data, sidestepping the limitations of reanalysis data. Our model provides predictions at 6-hour intervals for up to 72 hours in advance and outperforms both state-of-the-art data-driven methods and numerical weather prediction models. In line with our efforts to mitigate adversities inflicted by typhoons, we release our preprocessed PHYSICS TRACK dataset, which includes ERA5 reanalysis data, typhoon best-track, and UM forecast data.},

@inproceedings{park2024denoising,
  abstract = {Diffusion models generate highly realistic images by learning a multi-step denoising process, naturally embodying the principles of multi-task learning (MTL). Despite the inherent connection between diffusion models and MTL, there remains an unexplored area in designing neural architectures that explicitly incorporate MTL into the framework of diffusion models. In this paper, we present Denoising Task Routing (DTR), a simple add-on strategy for existing diffusion model architectures to establish distinct information pathways for individual tasks within a single architecture by selectively activating subsets of channels in the model. What makes DTR particularly compelling is its seamless integration of prior knowledge of denoising tasks into the framework: (1) Task Affinity: DTR activates similar channels for tasks at adjacent timesteps and shifts activated channels as sliding windows through timesteps, capitalizing on the inherent strong affinity between tasks at adjacent timesteps. (2) Task Weights: During the early stages (higher timesteps) of the denoising process, DTR assigns a greater number of task-specific channels, leveraging the insight that diffusion models prioritize reconstructing global structure and perceptually rich contents in earlier stages, and focus on simple noise removal in later stages. Our experiments reveal that DTR not only consistently boosts diffusion models' performance across different evaluation protocols without adding extra parameters but also accelerates training convergence. Finally, we show the complementarity between our architectural approach and existing MTL optimization techniques, providing a more complete view of MTL in the context of diffusion training. Significantly, by leveraging this complementarity, we attain matched performance of DiT-XL using the smaller DiT-L with a reduction in training iterations from 7M to 2M.

@inproceedings{park2024forward,
  abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, such as recommendation, drug discovery, and question answering. Behind the success of GNNs lies the backpropagation (BP) algorithm, which is the de facto standard for training deep neural networks (NNs). However, despite its effectiveness, BP imposes several constraints, which are not only biologically implausible, but also limit the scalability, parallelism, and flexibility in learning NNs. Examples of such constraints include storage of neural activities computed in the forward pass for use in the subsequent backward pass, and the dependence of parameter updates on non-local signals. To address these limitations, the forward-forward algorithm (FF) was recently proposed as an alternative to BP in the image classification domain, which trains NNs by performing two forward passes over positive and negative data. Inspired by this advance, we propose ForwardGNN in this work, a new forward learning procedure for GNNs, which avoids the constraints imposed by BP via an effective layer-wise local forward training. ForwardGNN extends the original FF to deal with graph data and GNNs, and makes it possible to operate without generating negative inputs (hence no longer forward-forward). Further, ForwardGNN enables each layer to learn from both the bottom-up and top-down signals without relying on the backpropagation of errors. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show the effectiveness and generality of the proposed forward graph learning framework. We release our code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/forwardgnn.},

@inproceedings{patel2024curriculum,
  abstract = {The key challenge in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era is finding useful circuits compatible with current device limitations. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) offer a potential solution by fixing the circuit architecture and optimizing individual gate parameters in an external loop. However, parameter optimization can become intractable, and the overall performance of the algorithm depends heavily on the initially chosen circuit architecture. Several quantum architecture search (QAS) algorithms have been developed to design useful circuit architectures automatically. In the case of parameter optimization alone, noise effects have been observed to dramatically influence the performance of the optimizer and final outcomes, which is a key line of study. However, the effects of noise on the architecture search, which could be just as critical, are poorly understood. This work addresses this gap by introducing a curriculum-based reinforcement learning QAS (CRLQAS) algorithm designed to tackle challenges in realistic VQA deployment. The algorithm incorporates (i) a 3D architecture encoding and restrictions on environment dynamics to explore the search space of possible circuits efficiently, (ii) an episode halting scheme to steer the agent to find shorter circuits, and (iii) a novel variant of simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation as an optimizer for faster convergence. To facilitate studies, we developed an optimized simulator for our algorithm, significantly improving computational efficiency in simulating noisy quantum circuits by employing the Pauli-transfer matrix formalism in the Pauli-Liouville basis. Numerical experiments focusing on quantum chemistry tasks demonstrate that CRLQAS outperforms existing QAS algorithms across several metrics in both noiseless and noisy environments.},

On the other hand, transformers are flexible, neural sequence models that present the intriguing possibility of providing general-purpose prediction methods, even in this mixture setting. In this work, we investigate the hypothesis that transformers can learn an optimal predictor for mixtures of regressions. We construct a generative process for a mixture of linear regressions for which the decision-theoretic optimal procedure is given by data-driven exponential weights on a finite set of parameters. We observe that transformers achieve low mean-squared error on data generated via this process. By probing the transformer's output at inference time, we also show that transformers typically make predictions that are close to the optimal predictor. Our experiments also demonstrate that transformers can learn mixtures of regressions in a sample-efficient fashion and are somewhat robust to distribution shifts. We complement our experimental observations by proving constructively that the decision-theoretic optimal procedure is indeed implementable by a transformer.},

@inproceedings{patil2024can,
  abstract = {Pretrained language models sometimes possess knowledge that we do not wish them to, including memorized personal information and knowledge that could be used to harm people. They can also output toxic or harmful text. To mitigate these safety and informational issues, we propose an attack-and-defense framework for studying the task of deleting sensitive information directly from model weights. We study direct edits to model weights because (1) this approach should guarantee that particular deleted information is never extracted by future prompt attacks, and (2) it should protect against whitebox attacks, which is necessary for making claims about safety/privacy in a setting where publicly available model weights could be used to elicit sensitive information. Our threat model assumes that an attack succeeds if the answer to a sensitive question is located among a set of B generated candidates, based on scenarios where the information would be insecure if the answer is among B candidates. Experimentally, we show that even state-of-the-art model editing methods such as ROME struggle to truly delete factual information from models like GPT-J, as our whitebox and blackbox attacks can recover 'deleted' information from an edited model 38% of the time. These attacks leverage two key observations: (1) that traces of deleted information can be found in intermediate model hidden states, and (2) that applying an editing method for one question may not delete information across rephrased versions of the question. Finally, we provide new defense methods that protect against some extraction attacks, but we do not find a single universally effective defense method. Our results suggest that truly deleting sensitive information is a tractable but difficult problem, since even relatively low attack success rates have potentially severe societal implications for real-world deployment of language models.},

Our paper bridges this gap and extends LipSDP beyond slope-restricted activation functions. To this end, we provide novel quadratic constraints for GroupSort, MaxMin, and Householder activations via leveraging their underlying properties such as sum preservation.

  abstract = {Audio-visual speech separation methods aim to integrate different modalities to generate high-quality separated speech, thereby enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as speech recognition. Most existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models operate in the time domain. However, their overly simplistic approach to modeling acoustic features often necessitates larger and more computationally intensive models in order to achieve SOTA performance. In this paper, we present a novel time-frequency domain audio-visual speech separation method: Recurrent Time-Frequency Separation Network (RTFS-Net), which applies its algorithms on the complex time-frequency bins yielded by the Short-Time Fourier Transform. We model and capture the time and frequency dimensions of the audio independently using a multi-layered RNN along each dimension. Furthermore, we introduce a unique attention-based fusion technique for the efficient integration of audio and visual information, and a new mask separation approach that takes advantage of the intrinsic spectral nature of the acoustic features for a clearer separation. RTFS-Net outperforms the prior SOTA method in both inference speed and separation quality while reducing the number of parameters by 90% and MACs by 83%. This is the first time-frequency domain audio-visual speech separation method to outperform all contemporary time-domain counterparts.},

To discover similar neural architectures in an efficient and automatic manner, we define a new problem Neural Architecture Retrieval which retrieves a set of existing neural architectures which have similar designs to the query neural architecture. We divide computational graphs into motifs and use multi-level contrastive learning to improve graph representations for this retrieval task.

  abstract = {Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection empowers the model trained on the closed image set to identify unknown data in the open world. Though many prior techniques have yielded considerable improvements in this research direction, two crucial obstacles still remain. Firstly, a unified perspective has yet to be presented to view the developed arts with individual designs, which is vital for providing insights into future work. Secondly, we expect sufficient natural OOD supervision to promote the generation of compact boundaries between the in-distribution (ID) and OOD data without collecting explicit OOD samples. To tackle these issues, we propose a general probabilistic framework to interpret many existing methods and an OOD-data-free model, namely Self-supervised Sampling for OOD Detection (SSOD). SSOD efficiently exploits natural OOD signals from the ID data based on the local property of convolution. With these supervisions, it jointly optimizes the OOD detection and conventional ID classification in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments reveal that SSOD establishes competitive state-of-the-art performance on many large-scale benchmarks, outperforming the best previous method by a large margin, e.g., reporting -6.28\% FPR95 and +0.77\% AUROC on ImageNet, -19.01\% FPR95 and +3.04\% AUROC on CIFAR-10, and top-ranked performance on hard OOD datasets, i.e., ImageNet-O and OpenImage-O.},

  abstract = {Post-hoc out-of-distribution (OOD) detection has garnered intensive attention in reliable machine learning. Many efforts have been dedicated to deriving score functions based on logits, distances, or rigorous data distribution assumptions to identify low-scoring OOD samples. Nevertheless, these estimate scores may fail to accurately reflect the true data density or impose impractical constraints. To provide a unified perspective on density-based score design, we propose a novel theoretical framework grounded in Bregman divergence, which extends distribution considerations to encompass an exponential family of distributions. Leveraging the conjugation constraint revealed in our theorem, we introduce a ConjNorm method, reframing density function design as a search for the optimal norm coefficient $p$ against the given dataset. In light of the computational challenges of normalization, we devise an unbiased and analytically tractable estimator of the partition function using the Monte Carlo-based importance sampling technique. Extensive experiments across OOD detection benchmarks empirically demonstrate that our proposed ConjNorm has established a new state-of-the-art in a variety of OOD detection setups, outperforming the current best method by up to 13.25\% and 28.19\% (FPR95) on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, respectively.},

@inproceedings{peng2024learning,
  abstract = {We describe a framework for using natural language to design state abstractions for imitation learning. Generalizable policy learning in high-dimensional observation spaces is facilitated by well-designed state representations, which can surface important features of an environment and hide irrelevant ones. These state representations are typically manually specified, or derived from other labor-intensive labeling procedures. Our method, LGA (language-guided abstraction), uses a combination of natural language supervision and background knowledge from language models (LMs) to automatically build state representations tailored to unseen tasks. In LGA, a user first provides a (possibly incomplete) description of a target task in natural language; next, a pre-trained LM translates this task description into a state abstraction function that masks out irrelevant features; finally, an imitation policy is trained using a small number of demonstrations and LGA-generated abstract states. Experiments on simulated robotic tasks show that LGA yields state abstractions similar to those designed by humans, but in a fraction of the time, and that these abstractions improve generalization and robustness in the presence of spurious correlations and ambiguous specifications. We illustrate the utility of the learned abstractions on mobile manipulation tasks with a Spot robot.},

  abstract = {The conventional evaluation protocols on machine learning models rely heavily on a labeled, i.i.d-assumed testing dataset, which is not often present in real-world applications. The Automated Model Evaluation (AutoEval) shows an alternative to this traditional workflow, by forming a proximal prediction pipeline of the testing performance without the presence of ground-truth labels. Despite its recent successes, the AutoEval frameworks still suffer from an overconfidence issue, substantial storage and computational cost. In that regard, we propose a novel measure -- Meta-Distribution Energy (MDE) -- that allows the AutoEval framework to be both more efficient and effective. The core of the MDE is to establish a meta-distribution statistic, on the information (energy) associated with individual samples, then offer a smoother representation enabled by energy-based learning. We further provide our theoretical insights by connecting the MDE with the classification loss. We provide extensive experiments across modalities, datasets and different architectural backbones to validate MDE's validity, together with its superiority compared with prior approaches. We also prove MDE's versatility by showing its seamless integration with large-scale models, and easy adaption to learning scenarios with noisy- or imbalanced- labels.},

Despite their empirical successes, there is little theoretical understanding of how these techniques influence the internal computation of the model and their expressiveness limitations. We show that despite the continuous embedding space being more expressive than the discrete token space, soft-prompting and prefix-tuning are potentially less expressive than full fine-tuning, even with the same number of learnable parameters. Concretely, context-based fine-tuning cannot change the relative attention pattern over the content and can only bias the outputs of an attention layer in a fixed direction. This suggests that while techniques like prompting, in-context learning, soft prompting, and prefix-tuning can effectively elicit skills present in the pretrained model, they may not be able to learn novel tasks that require new attention patterns.},

This poses fresh challenges for modern object detection systems. To develop an IOD system, we create a dataset called IOD-Bench, which consists of instruction-guided detections, along with specialized evaluation metrics. We leverage large-scale language models (LLMs) to generate a diverse set of instructions (8k+) based on existing public object detection datasets, covering a wide range of real-world scenarios. As an initial approach to the IOD task, we propose a model called Ins-DetCLIP. It harnesses the extensive knowledge within LLMs to empower the detector with instruction-following capabilities. Specifically, our Ins-DetCLIP employs a visual encoder (i.e., DetCLIP, an open-vocabulary detector) to extract object-level features. These features are then aligned with the input instructions using a cross-modal fusion module integrated into a pre-trained LLM.},

Compared to previous versions of Stable Diffusion, SDXL leverages a three times larger UNet backbone, achieved by significantly increasing the number of attention blocks and including a second text encoder. Further, we design multiple novel conditioning schemes and train SDXL on multiple aspect ratios. To ensure highest quality results, we also introduce a refinement model which is used to improve the visual fidelity of samples generated by SDXL using a post-hoc image-to-image technique. We demonstrate that SDXL shows drastically improved performance compared the previous versions of Stable Diffusion and achieves results competitive with those of black-box state-of-the-art image generators.},

@inproceedings{pogodin2024synaptic,
  abstract = {A growing literature in computational neuroscience leverages gradient descent and learning algorithms that approximate it to study synaptic plasticity in the brain. However, the vast majority of this work ignores a critical underlying assumption: the choice of distance for synaptic changes - i.e. the geometry of synaptic plasticity. Gradient descent assumes that the distance is Euclidean, but many other distances are possible, and there is no reason that biology necessarily uses Euclidean geometry. Here, using the theoretical tools provided by mirror descent, we show that the distribution of synaptic weights will depend on the geometry of synaptic plasticity. We use these results to show that experimentally-observed log-normal weight distributions found in several brain areas are not consistent with standard gradient descent (i.e. a Euclidean geometry), but rather with non-Euclidean distances. Finally, we show that it should be possible to experimentally test for different synaptic geometries by comparing synaptic weight distributions before and after learning. Overall, our work shows that the current paradigm in theoretical work on synaptic plasticity that assumes Euclidean synaptic geometry may be misguided and that it should be possible to experimentally determine the true geometry of synaptic plasticity in the brain.},

However, the predominant emphasis in most interactive environments is on learning, often at the expense of complexity in reasoning. In this paper, we introduce {CivRealm}, an environment inspired by the {Civilization} game. {Civilization's} profound alignment with human society requires sophisticated learning and prior knowledge, while its ever-changing space and action space demand robust reasoning for generalization. Particularly, {CivRealm} sets up an imperfect-information general-sum game with a changing number of players; it presents a plethora of complex features, challenging the agent to deal with open-ended stochastic environments that require diplomacy and negotiation skills. Within {CivRealm}, we provide interfaces for two typical agent types: tensor-based agents that focus on learning, and language-based agents that emphasize reasoning. To catalyze further research, we present initial results for both paradigms. The canonical {RL}-based agents exhibit reasonable performance in mini-games, whereas both {RL}- and {LLM}-based agents struggle to make substantial progress in the full game.

In this work, we introduce a scheduling strategy that, to our knowledge, is the first to successfully achieve zero pipeline bubbles under synchronous training semantics. The key idea behind this improvement is to split the backward computation into two parts, one that computes gradient for the input and another that computes for the parameters. Based on this idea, we handcraft novel pipeline schedules that significantly outperform the baseline methods. We further develop an algorithm that automatically finds an optimal schedule based on specific model configuration and memory limit. Additionally, to truly achieve zero bubble, we introduce a novel technique to bypass synchronizations during the optimizer step. Experimental evaluations show that our method outperforms the {1F1B} schedule up to 15\% in throughput under a similar memory limit. This number can be further pushed to 30\% when the memory constraint is relaxed. We believe our results mark a major step forward in harnessing the true potential of pipeline parallelism.

However, they operate on a fixed input graph structure, ignoring potential noise and missing information. Furthermore, their local aggregation mechanism can lead to problems such as over-squashing and limited expressive power in capturing relevant graph structures. Existing solutions to these challenges have primarily relied on heuristic methods, often disregarding the underlying data distribution. Hence, devising principled approaches for learning to infer graph structures relevant to the given prediction task remains an open challenge. In this work, leveraging recent progress in exact and differentiable k-subset sampling, we devise probabilistically rewired {MPNNs} ({PR-MPNNs}), which learn to add relevant edges while omitting less beneficial ones. For the first time, our theoretical analysis explores how {PR-MPNNs} enhance expressive power, and we identify precise conditions under which they outperform purely randomized approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates issues like over-squashing and under-reaching. In addition, on established real-world datasets, our method exhibits competitive or superior predictive performance compared to traditional {MPNN} models and recent graph transformer architectures.},

Our observation is: prompt-tuning releases the necessity of task identifier for gradient projection method; and gradient projection provides theoretical guarantees against forgetting for prompt-tuning. This inspires a new prompt gradient projection approach ({PGP}) for continual learning. In {PGP}, we deduce that reaching the orthogonal condition for prompt gradient can effectively prevent forgetting via the self-attention mechanism in vision-transformer. The condition equations are then realized by conducting Singular Value Decomposition ({SVD}) on an element-wise sum space between input space and prompt space.

  abstract = {Data mixing augmentation has been widely applied to improve the generalization ability of deep neural networks. Recently, offline data mixing augmentation, e.g. handcrafted and saliency information-based mixup, has been gradually replaced by automatic mixing approaches. Through minimizing two sub-tasks, namely, mixed sample generation and mixup classification in an end-to-end way, {AutoMix} significantly improves accuracy on image classification tasks. However, as the optimization objective is consistent for the two sub-tasks, this approach is prone to generating consistent instead of diverse mixed samples, which results in overfitting for target task training. In this paper, we propose {AdAutomixup}, an adversarial automatic mixup augmentation approach that generates challenging samples to train a robust classifier for image classification, by alternatively optimizing the classifier and the mixup sample generator. {AdAutomixup} comprises two modules, a mixed example generator, and a target classifier. The mixed sample generator aims to produce hard mixed examples to challenge the target classifier, while the target classifier's aim is to learn robust features from hard mixed examples to improve generalization. To prevent the collapse of the inherent meanings of images, we further introduce an exponential moving average ({EMA}) teacher and cosine similarity to train {AdAutomixup} in an end-to-end way. Extensive experiments on seven image benchmarks consistently prove that our approach outperforms the state of the art in various classification scenarios.},

We first present {ToolBench}, an instruction-tuning dataset for tool use, which is constructed automatically using {ChatGPT}. Specifically, the construction can be divided into three stages: (i) {API} collection: we collect 16,464 real-world {RESTful} {APIs} spanning 49 categories from {RapidAPI} Hub; (ii) instruction generation: we prompt {ChatGPT} to generate diverse instructions involving these {APIs}, covering both single-tool and multi-tool scenarios; (iii) solution path annotation: we use {ChatGPT} to search for a valid solution path (chain of {API} calls) for each instruction. To enhance the reasoning capabilities of {LLMs}, we develop a novel depth-first search-based decision tree algorithm. It enables {LLMs} to evaluate multiple reasoning traces and expand the search space. Moreover, to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of {LLMs}, we develop an automatic evaluator: {ToolEval}. Based on {ToolBench}, we fine-tune {LLaMA} to obtain an {LLM} {ToolLLaMA}, and equip it with a neural {API} retriever to recommend appropriate {APIs} for each instruction. Experiments show that {ToolLLaMA} demonstrates a remarkable ability to execute complex instructions and generalize to unseen {APIs}, and exhibits comparable performance to {ChatGPT}. Our {ToolLLaMA} also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization ability in an out-of-distribution tool-use dataset: {APIBench}.},

However, existing approaches tend to couple objects by leaking information from the neighboring contextual regions when the pairs have a limited overlap. In this paper, we first quantitatively identify and confirm the existence of such a coupling phenomenon. We then address it by developing a remarkably simple yet highly effective solution comprising a novel augmentation method, Region Collaborative Cutout ({RCC}), and a corresponding decoupling branch. Importantly, our design is versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into existing {SSL} frameworks, whether based on Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}) or Vision Transformers ({ViTs}). We conduct extensive experiments, incorporating our solution into two {CNN}-based and two {ViT}-based methods, with results confirming the effectiveness of our approach.},

@inproceedings{qiu2024phenomenal,
  abstract = {The ability to derive underlying principles from a handful of observations and then generalize to novel situations---known as inductive reasoning---is central to human intelligence. Prior work suggests that language models ({LMs}) often fall short on inductive reasoning, despite achieving impressive success on research benchmarks. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the inductive reasoning capabilities of {LMs} through iterative hypothesis refinement, a technique that more closely mirrors the human inductive process than standard input-output prompting. Iterative hypothesis refinement employs a three-step process: proposing, selecting, and refining hypotheses in the form of textual rules. By examining the intermediate rules, we observe that {LMs} are phenomenal hypothesis proposers (i.e., generating candidate rules), and when coupled with a (task-specific) symbolic interpreter that is able to systematically filter the proposed set of rules, this hybrid approach achieves strong results across inductive reasoning benchmarks that require inducing causal relations, language-like instructions, and symbolic concepts. However, they also behave as puzzling inductive reasoners, showing notable performance gaps between rule induction (i.e., identifying plausible rules) and rule application (i.e., applying proposed rules to instances), suggesting that {LMs} are proposing hypotheses without being able to actually apply the rules. Through empirical and human analyses, we further reveal several discrepancies between the inductive reasoning processes of {LMs} and humans, shedding light on both the potentials and limitations of using {LMs} in inductive reasoning tasks.},

The approach harnesses the power of diffusion models and presents a denoising network explicitly designed for the task of learning from a single input motion.

Specifically, we show how to estimate the Wasserstein distance between two samples stored and kept on different devices/clients whilst a central entity/server orchestrates the computations without having access to the samples. The algorithm, called FedWaD (for Federated Wasserstein Distance), iteratively approximates the Wasserstein distance by manipulating and exchanging distributions from the space of geodesics in lieu of the input samples. To achieve this, we take advantage of the geometric properties of the Wasserstein distance, particularly the triangle inequality, and that of the associated geodesics. In addition to establishing the convergence properties of FedWaD, we provide empirical results on federated coresets and federate optimal transport dataset distance.},

  abstract = {Synthesizing novel views for dynamic scenes from a collection of {RGB} inputs poses significant challenges due to the inherent under-constrained nature of the problem. To mitigate this ill-posedness, practitioners in the field of neural radiance fields ({NeRF}) often resort to the adoption of intricate geometric regularization techniques, including scene flow, depth estimation, or learned perceptual similarity. While these geometric cues have demonstrated their effectiveness, their incorporation leads to evaluation of computationally expensive off-the-shelf models, introducing substantial computational overhead into the pipeline. Moreover, seamlessly integrating such modules into diverse dynamic {NeRF} models can be a non-trivial task, hindering their utilization in an architecture-agnostic manner. In this paper, we propose a theoretically grounded, lightweight regularizer by treating the dynamics of a time-varying scene as a low-frequency change of a probability distribution of the light intensity. We constrain the dynamics of this distribution using optimal transport ({OT}) and provide error bounds under reasonable assumptions. Our regularization is learning-free, architecture agnostic, and can be implemented with just a few lines of code. Finally, we demonstrate the practical efficacy of our regularizer across state-of-the-art architectures.},

We find that current state-of-the-art empirical techniques offer sub-optimal performance on these practical, non-decomposable performance objectives. On the other hand, the theoretical techniques necessitate training a new model from scratch for each performance objective. To bridge the gap, we propose {SelMix}, a selective mixup-based inexpensive fine-tuning technique for pre-trained models, to optimize for the desired objective. The core idea of our framework is to determine a sampling distribution to perform a mixup of features between samples from particular classes such that it optimizes the given objective. We comprehensively evaluate our technique against the existing empirical and theoretically principled methods on standard benchmark datasets for imbalanced classification. We find that proposed {SelMix} fine-tuning significantly improves the performance for various practical non-decomposable objectives across benchmarks.},

Adversarial Training ({AT}) has emerged as a popular approach for protecting neural networks against such attacks. However, a key challenge of {AT} is robust overfitting, where the network's robust performance on test data deteriorates with further training, thus hindering generalization. Motivated by the concept of active forgetting in the brain, we introduce a novel learning paradigm called "Forget to Mitigate Overfitting ({FOMO})". {FOMO} alternates between the forgetting phase, which randomly forgets a subset of weights and regulates the model's information through weight reinitialization, and the relearning phase, which emphasizes learning generalizable features. Our experiments on benchmark datasets and adversarial attacks show that {FOMO} alleviates robust overfitting by significantly reducing the gap between the best and last robust test accuracy while improving the state-of-the-art robustness. Furthermore, {FOMO} provides a better trade-off between standard and robust accuracy, outperforming baseline adversarial methods. Finally, our framework is robust to {AutoAttacks} and increases generalization in many real-world scenarios.},

In this work, we enable small-scale {LMs} (approx. 200x smaller than {GPT-3}) to generate rationales that not only improve downstream task performance, but are also more plausible, consistent, and diverse, assessed both by automatic and human evaluation. Our method, {MaRio} (Multi-rewArd {RatIOnalization}), is a multi-reward conditioned self-rationalization algorithm that optimizes multiple distinct properties like plausibility, diversity and consistency. Results on five difficult question-answering datasets {StrategyQA}, {QuaRel}, {OpenBookQA}, {NumerSense} and {QASC} show that not only does {MaRio} improve task accuracy, but it also improves the self-rationalization quality of small {LMs} across the aforementioned axes better than a supervised fine-tuning ({SFT}) baseline.

Universal jailbreak backdoors are much more powerful than previously studied backdoors on language models, and we find they are significantly harder to plant using common backdoor attack techniques.

These challenges necessitate methods that are not only accurate but computationally efficient. Unfortunately, most current state-of-the-art methods for time series forecasting are based on Transformers, which scale poorly due to quadratic complexity in sequence length, and are therefore needlessly computationally inefficient. Moreover, with a few exceptions, these methods have only been evaluated for non-probabilistic point estimation. In this work, we address these two shortcomings. For the first, we introduce {VQ-TR}, which maps large sequences to a discrete set of latent representations as part of the Attention module. This not only allows us to attend over larger context windows with linear complexity in sequence length but also allows for effective regularization to avoid overfitting. For the second, we provide what is to the best of our knowledge the first systematic comparison of modern Transformer-based time series forecasting methods for probabilistic forecasting. In this comparison, we find that {VQ-TR} performs better or comparably to all other methods while being computationally efficient.},

@inproceedings{razin2024vanishing,
  abstract = {Pretrained language models are commonly aligned with human preferences and downstream tasks via reinforcement finetuning ({RFT}), which refers to maximizing a (possibly learned) reward function using policy gradient algorithms. This work identifies a fundamental optimization obstacle in {RFT}: we prove that the expected gradient for an input vanishes when its reward standard deviation under the model is small, even if the expected reward is far from optimal. Through experiments on an {RFT} benchmark and controlled environments, as well as a theoretical analysis, we then demonstrate that vanishing gradients due to small reward standard deviation are prevalent and detrimental, leading to extremely slow reward maximization. Lastly, we explore ways to overcome vanishing gradients in {RFT}. We find the common practice of an initial supervised finetuning ({SFT}) phase to be the most promising candidate, which sheds light on its importance in an {RFT} pipeline. Moreover, we show that a relatively small number of {SFT} optimization steps on as few as 1\% of the input samples can suffice, indicating that the initial {SFT} phase need not be expensive in terms of compute and data labeling efforts.},

@inproceedings{reddi2024robust,
  abstract = {Robustness against adversarial attacks and distribution shifts is a long-standing goal of Reinforcement Learning ({RL}). To this end, Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning ({RARL}) trains a protagonist against destabilizing forces exercised by an adversary in a competitive zero-sum Markov game, whose optimal solution, i.e., rational strategy, corresponds to a Nash equilibrium. However, finding Nash equilibria requires facing complex saddle point optimization problems, which can be prohibitive to solve, especially for high-dimensional control. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for adversarial {RL} based on entropy regularization to ease the complexity of the saddle point optimization problem. We show that the solution of this entropy-regularized problem corresponds to a Quantal Response Equilibrium ({QRE}), a generalization of Nash equilibria that accounts for bounded rationality, i.e., agents sometimes play random actions instead of optimal ones. Crucially, the connection between the entropy-regularized objective and {QRE} enables free modulation of the rationality of the agents by simply tuning the temperature coefficient. We leverage this insight to propose our novel algorithm, Quantal Adversarial {RL} ({QARL}), which gradually increases the rationality of the adversary in a curriculum fashion until it is fully rational, easing the complexity of the optimization problem while retaining robustness.},

@inproceedings{reddy2024mechanistic,
  abstract = {Transformer models exhibit in-context learning: the ability to accurately predict the response to a novel query based on illustrative examples in the input sequence, which contrasts with traditional in-weights learning of query-output relationships. What aspects of the training data distribution and architecture favor in-context vs in-weights learning? Recent work has shown that specific distributional properties inherent in language, such as burstiness, large dictionaries and skewed rank-frequency distributions, control the trade-off or simultaneous appearance of these two forms of learning. We first show that these results are recapitulated in a minimal attention-only network trained on a simplified dataset. In-context learning (ICL) is driven by the abrupt emergence of an induction head, which subsequently competes with in-weights learning. By identifying progress measures that precede in-context learning and targeted experiments, we construct a two-parameter model of an induction head which emulates the full data distributional dependencies displayed by the attention-based network. A phenomenological model of induction head formation traces its abrupt emergence to the sequential learning of three nested logits enabled by an intrinsic curriculum. We propose that the sharp transitions in attention-based networks arise due to a specific chain of multi-layer operations necessary to achieve ICL, which is implemented by nested nonlinearities sequentially learned during training.},

Even though these models offer impressive performance, their practical application is often limited by the prohibitive amount of resources required for every inference. Early-exiting dynamic neural networks (EDNN) circumvent this issue by allowing a model to make some of its predictions from intermediate layers (i.e., early-exit). Training an EDNN architecture is challenging as it consists of two intertwined components: the gating mechanism (GM) that controls early-exiting decisions and the intermediate inference modules (IMs) that perform inference from intermediate representations. We identify two fundamental shortcomings in existing approaches: the GMs and the IMs are decoupled during training, leading to a train-test mismatch; and the thresholding gating mechanism introduces a positive bias into the predictive probabilities. We propose a novel architecture that connects these two modules, leading to significant performance improvements on classification datasets and enabling better uncertainty characterization capabilities.},

This includes many of the most popular examples of kernels defined on the nodes of a graph. Our algorithm enjoys subquadratic time complexity with respect to the number of nodes, overcoming the notoriously prohibitive cubic scaling of exact graph kernel evaluation. It can also be trivially distributed across machines, permitting learning on much larger networks. At the heart of the algorithm is a modulation function which upweights or downweights the contribution from different random walks depending on their lengths. We show that by parameterising it with a neural network we can obtain g-GRFs that give higher-quality kernel estimates or perform efficient, scalable kernel learning. We provide robust theoretical analysis and support our findings with experiments including pointwise estimation of fixed graph kernels, solving non-homogeneous graph ordinary differential equations, node clustering and kernel regression on triangular meshes.},

Existing solutions concentrate on fine-tuning the pre-trained models on conventional image datasets. As a result of the success of recent pre-trained models derived from larger-scale datasets, it is challenging to adapt the model to the DML tasks in the local data domain while retaining the previously gained knowledge. In this paper, we investigate parameter-efficient methods for fine-tuning the pre-trained model for DML tasks. In particular, we propose a novel and effective framework based on learning Visual Prompts (VPT) in the pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT). Based on the conventional proxy-based DML paradigm, we augment the proxy by incorporating the semantic information from the input image and the ViT, in which we optimize the visual prompts for each class. We demonstrate that our new approximations with semantic information are superior to representative capabilities, thereby improving metric learning performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our proposed framework is superior and efficient by evaluating popular DML benchmarks. In particular, we demonstrate that our fine-tuning method achieves comparable or even better performance than recent state-of-the-art full fine-tuning works of DML while tuning only a small percentage of total parameters.},

Specifically, we prove the following three conditions for the emergence: (i) The high-order derivatives of the network output with respect to the input variables are all zero. (ii) The DNN can be used on occluded samples, and when the input sample is less occluded, the DNN will yield higher confidence. (iii) The confidence of the DNN does not significantly degrade on occluded samples. These conditions are quite common, and we prove that under these conditions, the DNN will only encode a relatively small number of sparse interactions between input variables. Moreover, we can consider such interactions as symbolic primitive inference patterns encoded by a DNN, because we show that inference scores of the DNN on an exponentially large number of randomly masked samples can always be well mimicked by numerical effects of just a few interactions.},

@inproceedings{ren2024emo,
  abstract = {Neural language models are probabilistic models of human text. They are predominantly trained using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which is equivalent to minimizing the forward cross-entropy between the empirical data distribution and the model distribution. However, various degeneration phenomena are still widely observed when decoding from the distributions learned by such models. We establish that the forward cross-entropy is suboptimal as a distance metric for aligning human and model distribution due to its (1) recall-prioritization (2) negative diversity ignorance and (3) train-test mismatch. In this paper, we propose Earth Mover Distance Optimization (EMO) for auto-regressive language modeling. EMO capitalizes on the inherent properties of earth mover distance to address the aforementioned challenges. Due to the high complexity of direct computation, we further introduce a feasible upper bound for EMO to ease end-to-end training. Upon extensive evaluation of language models trained using EMO and MLE, we find that EMO demonstrates a consistently better language modeling performance than MLE across domains. Moreover, EMO demonstrates noteworthy enhancements in downstream performance with minimal fine-tuning on merely 25,000 sentences. This highlights the tremendous potential of EMO as a lightweight calibration method for enhancing large-scale pre-trained language models.},

  abstract = {Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that respond to local changes in light intensity and feature low latency, high energy efficiency, and high dynamic range. Meanwhile, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable efficiency and fault tolerance. By synergistically harnessing the energy efficiency inherent in event cameras and the spike-based processing capabilities of SNNs, their integration could enable ultra-low-power application scenarios, such as action recognition tasks. However, existing approaches often entail converting asynchronous events into conventional frames, leading to additional data mapping efforts and a loss of sparsity, contradicting the design concept of SNNs and event cameras. To address this challenge, we propose SpikePoint, a novel end-to-end point-based SNN architecture that can process sparse event cloud data directly. SpikePoint excels at processing sparse event cloud data, effectively extracting both global and local features through a singular-stage structure. Experimental results on four event-based action recognition datasets demonstrate that SpikePoint achieves state-of-the-art performance using only 16 timesteps. Moreover, SpikePoint also exhibits remarkable efficiency, utilizing approximately 0.3\% of parameters and 0.5\% of power consumption compared to artificial neural networks.},

The recent plug-and-play unadjusted Langevin algorithm (PnP-ULA) has emerged as a promising method for Monte Carlo sampling and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation by combining physical measurement models with deep-learning priors specified using image denoisers. However, the intricate relationship between the sampling distribution of PnP-ULA and the mismatched data-fidelity and denoiser has not been theoretically analyzed. We address this gap by proposing a posterior-$L_2$ pseudometric and using it to quantify an explicit error bound for PnP-ULA under mismatched posterior distribution. We numerically validate our theory on several inverse problems such as sampling from Gaussian mixture models and image deblurring. Our results suggest that the sensitivity of the sampling distribution of PnP-ULA to a mismatch in the measurement model and the denoiser can be precisely characterized.},

Existing works address this problem by first identifying clusters (or directions) of incorrectly classified samples in a latent space and then aiming to provide human-understandable text descriptions for them. We observe that in some cases, describing text does not match well with identified failure modes, partially owing to the fact that shared interpretable attributes of failure modes may not be captured using clustering in the feature space. To improve on these shortcomings, we propose a novel approach that prioritizes interpretability in this problem: we start by obtaining human-understandable concepts (tags) of images in the dataset and then analyze the model's behavior based on the presence or absence of combinations of these tags. Our method also ensures that the tags describing a failure mode form a minimal set, avoiding redundant and noisy descriptions. Through several experiments on different datasets, we show that our method successfully identifies failure modes and generates high-quality text descriptions associated with them. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing interpretability in understanding model failures.},

Existing meta-RL algorithms are characterized by low sample efficiency, and mostly focus on low-dimensional task distributions. In parallel, model-based RL methods have been successful in solving partially observable MDPs, of which meta-RL is a special case. In this work, we leverage this success and propose a new model-based approach to meta-RL, based on elements from existing state-of-the-art model-based and meta-RL methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on common meta-RL benchmark domains, attaining greater return with better sample efficiency (up to 15x improvement) while requiring very little hyperparameter tuning.},

Since LLMs train on wide swaths of the internet, this practice raises concerns of data contamination, i.e., evaluating on examples that are explicitly or implicitly included in the training data. We conduct the first thorough longitudinal analysis of data contamination in LLMs by using the natural experiment of training cutoffs in GPT models to look at benchmarks released over time. Specifically, we consider two code/mathematical problem-solving datasets, Codeforces and Project Euler, and find statistically significant trends among LLM pass rate vs. GitHub popularity and release date that provide strong evidence of contamination.},

To understand this shortcoming, we first show that the commonly used surrogate-based relaxation used in adversarial training algorithms voids all guarantees on the robustness of trained classifiers.

Distinct from the fixed-space global optimality of non-convex optimization, this new form of convergence, and the techniques introduced to prove such convergence, pave the way for a usable deep learning convergence theory in the near future, without overparameterization assumptions relating the number of parameters and training samples. We define these architectures from a simple computation graph and a mechanism to lift it, thus increasing the number of parameters, generalizing the idea of increasing the widths of multi-layer perceptrons. We show that architectures similar to most common deep learning models are present in this class, obtained by sparsifying the weight tensors of usual architectures at initialization. Leveraging tools of algebraic topology and random graph theory, we use the computation graph's geometry to propagate properties guaranteeing convergence to any precision for these large sparse models.},

@inproceedings{rocamonde2024visionlanguage,
  abstract = {Reinforcement learning ({RL}) requires either manually specifying a reward function, which is often infeasible, or learning a reward model from a large amount of human feedback, which is often very expensive. We study a more sample-efficient alternative: using pretrained vision-language models ({VLMs}) as zero-shot reward models ({RMs}) to specify tasks via natural language. We propose a natural and general approach to using {VLMs} as reward models, which we call {VLM}-{RMs}. We use {VLM}-{RMs} based on {CLIP} to train a {MuJoCo} humanoid to learn complex tasks without a manually specified reward function, such as kneeling, doing the splits, and sitting in a lotus position. For each of these tasks, we only provide a single sentence text prompt describing the desired task with minimal prompt engineering. We can improve performance by providing a second "baseline" prompt and projecting out parts of the {CLIP} embedding space irrelevant to distinguish between goal and baseline. Further, we find a strong scaling effect for {VLM}-{RMs}: larger {VLMs} trained with more compute and data are better reward models. The failure modes of {VLM}-{RMs} we encountered are all related to known capability limitations of current {VLMs}, such as limited spatial reasoning ability or visually unrealistic environments that are far off-distribution for the {VLM}. We find that {VLM}-{RMs} are remarkably robust as long as the {VLM} is large enough. This suggests that future {VLMs} will become more and more useful reward models for a wide range of {RL} applications.},

By parameterizing an image as a multilayer perceptron ({MLP}) on Euclidean space, {INRs} effectively couple spatial and spectral features of the represented signal in a way that is not obvious in the usual discrete representation. Although {INRs} using sinusoidal activation functions have been studied in terms of Fourier theory, recent works have shown the advantage of using wavelets instead of sinusoids as activation functions, due to their ability to simultaneously localize in both frequency and space. In this work, we approach such {INRs} and demonstrate how they resolve high-frequency features of signals from coarse approximations performed in the first layer of the {MLP}. This leads to multiple prescriptions for the design of {INR} architectures, including the use of progressive wavelets, decoupling of low and high-pass approximations, and initialization schemes based on the singularities of the target signal.},

They were shown to be universal function approximators, with two reservations: 1. The initial node features must be augmented with certain positional encodings. 2. The approximation is non-uniform: Graphs of different sizes may require a different approximating network. We first clarify that this form of universality is not unique to {GTs}: Using the same positional encodings, also pure {MPGNNs} and even 2-layer {MLPs} are non-uniform universal approximators. We then analyze the uniform case, where a single network must approximate the target function on graphs of all sizes. We show that {GTs} and {MPGNNs} with virtual nodes do not subsume each other in terms of uniform function approximation while neither is "universal" in this setting. The paper shows that a virtual node is not sufficient to emulate the intricate computation of self-attention uniformly, and provides a function that {GTs} can express but {MPGNNs} with virtual nodes cannot.},

In this work, we find these training variations to result in networks learning unique feature sets from the data. Using public model libraries comprising thousands of models trained on canonical datasets like {ImageNet}, we observe that for arbitrary pairings of pretrained models, one model extracts significant data context unavailable in the other -- independent of overall performance. Given any arbitrary pairing of pretrained models and no external rankings (such as separate test sets, e.g. due to data privacy), we investigate if it is possible to transfer such "complementary" knowledge from one model to another without performance degradation -- a task made particularly difficult as additional knowledge can be contained in stronger, equiperformant or weaker models. Yet facilitating robust transfer in scenarios agnostic to pretrained model pairings would unlock auxiliary gains and knowledge fusion from any model repository without restrictions on model and problem specifics - including from weaker, lower-performance models. This work therefore provides an initial, in-depth exploration on the viability of such general-purpose knowledge transfer.},

Our approach improves the generalization of large foundation models when fine-tuned on downstream tasks in a few-shot setting. The basic idea of {CoPrompt} is to enforce a consistency constraint in the prediction of the trainable and pre-trained models to prevent overfitting on the downstream task. Enforcing consistency on perturbed input serves to further regularize the consistency constraint, thereby improving generalization. Moreover, the integration of adapters and prompts not only enhances performance on downstream tasks but also offers increased tuning flexibility in both input and output spaces. This facilitates more effective adaptation to downstream tasks in a few-shot learning setting. Experiments show that {CoPrompt} outperforms existing methods on a range of evaluation suites, including base-to-novel generalization, domain generalization, and cross-dataset evaluation.},

Here we apply a recent development in the theory of feature learning, the adaptive kernel approach, to two teacher-student models with cubic-polynomial and modular addition teachers. We provide analytical predictions on feature learning and Grokking properties of these models and demonstrate a mapping between Grokking and the theory of phase transitions.

@inproceedings{rudman2024stable,
  abstract = {Given the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been considerable interest in studying the properties of model activations. The literature overwhelmingly agrees that LLM representations are dominated by a few "outlier dimensions" with exceedingly high variance and magnitude. Several studies in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have sought to mitigate the impact of such outlier dimensions and force LLMs to be isotropic (i.e., have uniform variance across all dimensions in embedding space). Isotropy is thought to be a desirable property for LLMs that improves model performance and more closely aligns textual representations with human intuition. However, many claims regarding isotropy in NLP have been based on the average cosine similarity of embeddings, which has recently been shown to be a flawed measure of isotropy. In this paper, we propose I-STAR: IsoScore*-based STable Anisotropic Regularization, a novel regularization method that can be used to increase or decrease levels of isotropy in embedding space during training. I-STAR uses IsoScore*, the first accurate measure of isotropy that is both differentiable and stable on mini-batch computations. In contrast to several previous works, we find that decreasing isotropy in contextualized embeddings improves performance on the majority of tasks and models considered in this paper.},

A trend in this area is to use a mixture-of-expert technique, where different models work together to solve the task. However, the experts are usually trained all at once using whole task data, which makes them all prone to forgetting and increasing computational burden. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel approach named SEED. SEED selects only one, the most optimal expert for a considered task, and uses data from this task to fine-tune only this expert. For this purpose, each expert represents each class with a Gaussian distribution, and the optimal expert is selected based on the similarity of those distributions. Consequently, SEED increases diversity and heterogeneity within the experts while maintaining the high stability of this ensemble method. The extensive experiments demonstrate that SEED achieves state-of-the-art performance in exemplar-free settings across various scenarios, showing the potential of expert diversification through data in continual learning.},

This integration aims to enhance both long-term memory and long-horizon credit assignment. Through a diverse set of illustrative tasks, we systematically demonstrate that R2I not only establishes a new state-of-the-art for challenging memory and credit assignment RL tasks, such as BSuite and POPGym, but also showcases superhuman performance in the complex memory domain of Memory Maze. At the same time, it upholds comparable performance in classic RL tasks, such as Atari and DMC, suggesting the generality of our method. We also show that R2I is faster than the state-of-the-art MBRL method, DreamerV3, resulting in faster wall-time convergence.},

We prove one can decompose sampling from a density (minimal assumptions made on the density) into a sequence of sampling from log-concave conditional densities via accumulation of noisy measurements with equal noise levels. Our construction is unique in that it keeps track of a history of samples, making it non-Markovian as a whole, but it is lightweight algorithmically as the history only shows up in the form of a running empirical mean of samples. The sampling algorithm generalizes walk-jump sampling, where the "walk" phase becomes a (non-Markovian) chain of (log-concave) Markov chains. A remarkable capacity of our sampling algorithm is its ability to "tunnel" between modes of a distribution.},

However, the questions of when and which parts of the context affect model generations are typically tackled separately, and current plausibility evaluations are practically limited to a handful of artificial benchmarks. To address these limitations, we introduce Plausibility Evaluation of Context Reliance (PECoRe), an end-to-end interpretability framework designed to quantify context usage in language models' generations. PECoRe leverages model internals to (i) contrastively identify context-sensitive target tokens in generated texts and (ii) link them to contextual cues justifying their prediction. We benchmark PECoRe by comparing model rationales with human annotations across several discourse-level phenomena. Finally, we apply PECoRe to unannotated model translations to identify context-mediated predictions and highlight instances of (im)plausible context usage throughout generation.},

Current UDG methods rely on domain labels, which are often challenging to collect, and domain-specific architectures that lack scalability when confronted with numerous domains, making the current methodology impractical and rigid. Inspired by contrastive-based UDG methods that mitigate spurious correlations by restricting comparisons to examples from the same domain, we hypothesize that eliminating style variability within a batch could provide a more convenient and flexible way to reduce spurious correlations.

This is because videos, the most abundant form of embodied behavioral data on the web, lack the action labels required by existing methods for imitating behavior from demonstrations. We introduce Latent Action Policies (LAPO), a method for recovering latent action information—and thereby latent-action policies, world models, and inverse dynamics models—purely from videos. LAPO is the first method able to recover the structure of the true action space just from observed dynamics, even in challenging procedurally-generated environments. LAPO enables training latent-action policies that can be rapidly fine-tuned into expert-level policies, either offline using a small action-labeled dataset, or online with rewards. LAPO takes a first step towards pre-training powerful, generalist policies and world models on the vast amounts of videos readily available on the web.},

@inproceedings{schnell2024stabilizing,
  abstract = {Of all the vector fields surrounding the minima of recurrent learning setups, the gradient field with its exploding and vanishing updates appears a poor choice for optimization, offering little beyond efficient computability. We seek to improve this suboptimal practice in the context of physics simulations, where backpropagating feedback through many unrolled time steps is considered crucial to acquiring temporally coherent behavior. The alternative vector field we propose follows from two principles: physics simulators, unlike neural networks, have a balanced gradient flow, and certain modifications to the backpropagation pass leave the positions of the original minima unchanged. As any modification of backpropagation decouples forward and backward pass, the rotation-free character of the gradient field is lost. Therefore, we discuss the negative implications of using such a rotational vector field for optimization and how to counteract them. Our final procedure is easily implementable via a sequence of gradient stopping and component-wise comparison operations, which do not negatively affect scalability. Our experiments on three control problems show that especially as we increase the complexity of each task, the unbalanced updates from the gradient can no longer provide the precise control signals necessary while our method still solves the tasks.},

@inproceedings{schro2024causal,
  abstract = {Fairness for machine learning predictions is widely required in practice for legal, ethical, and societal reasons. Existing work typically focuses on settings without unobserved confounding, even though unobserved confounding can lead to severe violations of causal fairness and, thus, unfair predictions. In this work, we analyze the sensitivity of causal fairness to unobserved confounding. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we derive bounds for causal fairness metrics under different sources of unobserved confounding. This enables practitioners to examine the sensitivity of their machine learning models to unobserved confounding in fairness-critical applications. Second, we propose a novel neural framework for learning fair predictions, which allows us to offer worst-case guarantees of the extent to which causal fairness can be violated due to unobserved confounding. Third, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in a series of experiments, including a real-world case study about predicting prison sentences. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to study causal fairness under unobserved confounding. To this end, our work is of direct practical value as a refutation strategy to ensure the fairness of predictions in high-stakes applications.},

@inproceedings{schug2024discovering,
  abstract = {Many complex tasks can be decomposed into simpler, independent parts. Discovering such underlying compositional structure has the potential to enable compositional generalization. Despite progress, our most powerful systems struggle to compose flexibly. It therefore seems natural to make models more modular to help capture the compositional nature of many tasks. However, it is unclear under which circumstances modular systems can discover hidden compositional structure. To shed light on this question, we study a teacher-student setting with a modular teacher where we have full control over the composition of ground truth modules. This allows us to relate the problem of compositional generalization to that of identification of the underlying modules. In particular we study modularity in hypernetworks representing a general class of multiplicative interactions. We show theoretically that identification up to linear transformation purely from demonstrations is possible without having to learn an exponential number of module combinations. We further demonstrate empirically that under the theoretically identified conditions, meta-learning from finite data can discover modular policies that generalize compositionally in a number of complex environments.},

These macro-at-$k$ metrics possess desired properties for extreme classification problems with long tail labels. Unfortunately, the at-$k$ constraint couples the otherwise independent binary classification tasks, leading to a much more challenging optimization problem than standard macro-averages. We provide a statistical framework to study this problem, prove the existence and the form of the optimal classifier, and propose a statistically consistent and practical learning algorithm based on the Frank-Wolfe method.

Existing approaches represent instances in a shared canonical space. However, for in-the-wild datasets a shared canonical system can be difficult to define or might not even exist. In this work, we instead model instances in view space, alleviating the need for posed images and learned camera distributions. We find that in this setting, existing GAN-based methods are prone to generating flat geometry and struggle with distribution coverage. We hence propose WildFusion, a new approach to 3D-aware image synthesis based on latent diffusion models (LDMs). WildFusion is trained without multiview or 3D geometry supervision and relies neither on posed images nor on learned pose or camera distributions. Key to our framework is an image autoencoder with a 3D-aware latent space that simultaneously enables not only novel view synthesis but also compression. This allows us to efficiently train a diffusion model in the autoencoder's latent space. WildFusion outperforms recent state-of-the-art GAN-based methods when training on diverse data without camera poses.},

  abstract = {As large language models (LLMs) are adopted as a fundamental component of language technologies, it is crucial to accurately characterize their performance. Because choices in prompt design can strongly influence model behavior, this design process is critical in effectively using any modern pre-trained generative language model. In this work, we focus on LLM sensitivity to a quintessential class of meaning-preserving design choices: prompt formatting. We find that several widely used open-source LLMs are extremely sensitive to subtle changes in prompt formatting in few-shot settings, with performance differences of up to 76 accuracy points when evaluated using LLaMA-2-13B. Sensitivity remains even when increasing model size, the number of few-shot examples, or performing instruction tuning. Our analysis suggests that work evaluating LLMs with prompting-based methods would benefit from reporting a range of performance across plausible prompt formats, instead of the currently-standard practice of reporting performance on a single format. We also show that format performance only weakly correlates between models, which puts into question the methodological validity of comparing models with an arbitrarily chosen, fixed prompt format. To facilitate systematic analysis we propose FormatSpread, an algorithm that rapidly evaluates a sampled set of plausible prompt formats for a given task, and reports the interval of expected performance without accessing model weights. Furthermore, we present a suite of analyses that characterize the nature of this sensitivity, including exploring the influence of particular atomic perturbations and the internal representation of particular formats.},

This binary differentiation of perfect and imperfect alignments falls short of capturing other essential alignment properties that hold significance in other real-world applications. Here we propose Align With Purpose, a general Plug-and-Play framework for enhancing a desired property in models trained with the CTC criterion. We do that by complementing the CTC with an additional loss term that prioritizes alignments according to a desired property. Our method does not require any intervention in the CTC loss function, enables easy optimization of a variety of properties, and allows differentiation between both perfect and imperfect alignments. We apply our framework in the domain of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and show its generality in terms of property selection, architectural choice, and scale of training dataset (up to 280,000 hours).},

  abstract = {We introduce the concept of scalable neural network kernels (SNNKs), the replacements of regular feedforward layers (FFLs), capable of approximating the latter, but with favorable computational properties. SNNKs effectively disentangle the inputs from the parameters of the neural network in the FFL, only to connect them in the final computation via the dot-product kernel. They are also strictly more expressive, as allowing to model complicated relationships beyond the functions of the dot-products of parameter-input vectors. We also introduce the neural network bundling process that applies SNNKs to compactify deep neural network architectures, resulting in additional compression gains. In its extreme version, it leads to the fully bundled network whose optimal parameters can be expressed via explicit formulae for several loss functions (e.g. mean squared error), opening a possibility to bypass backpropagation. As a by-product of our analysis, we introduce the mechanism of the universal random features (or URFs), applied to instantiate several SNNK variants, and interesting on its own in the context of scalable kernel methods. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis of all these concepts as well as an extensive empirical evaluation, ranging from point-wise kernel estimation to Transformers' fine-tuning with novel adapter layers inspired by SNNKs. Our mechanism provides up to 5x reduction in the number of trainable parameters, while maintaining competitive accuracy.},

Cosmos is end-to-end differentiable; also, unlike traditional neurosymbolic methods that require representations to be manually mapped to symbols, it computes an entity's symbolic attributes using vision-language foundation models. Through an evaluation that considers two different forms of CompGen on an established blocks-pushing domain, we show that the framework establishes a new state-of-the-art for CompGen in world modeling.},

To break this tradeoff, we advocate a novel concept of Structured Activation Sparsification, dubbed SAS, which boosts accuracy without increasing computation by utilizing the projected sparsity in activation maps with a specific structure. Concretely, the projected sparse activation is allowed to have N nonzero value among M consecutive activations. Owing to the local structure in sparsity, the wide matmul between a dense weight and the sparse activation is executed as an equivalent narrow matmul between a dense weight and dense activation, which is compatible with NVIDIA's SparseTensorCore developed for the N:M structured sparse weight. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that increasing sparsity monotonically improves accuracy (up to 7% on CIFAR10) without increasing the mult count. Furthermore, we show that structured sparsification of activation scales better than that of weight given the same computational budget.},

The primary objective of structure learning is to learn a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that represents the underlying probability distribution of the data. Many prominent DAG learners rely on least square losses or log-likelihood losses for optimization. It is well-known from regression models that least square losses are heavily influenced by the scale of the variables. Recently it has been demonstrated that the scale of data also affects performance of structure learning algorithms, though with a strong focus on linear 2-node systems and simulated data. Moving beyond these results, we provide conditions under which square-based losses are minimal for wrong DAGs in $d$-dimensional cases. Furthermore, we also show that scale can impair performance of structure learners if relations among variables are non-linear for both square based and log-likelihood based losses.

Recent advancements in meta-learning-based knowledge distillation (MetaKD) emphasize that the fine-tuning of teacher models should be aware of the student's need to achieve better knowledge distillation. However, existing MetaKD methods often lack incentives for the teacher model to improve itself. In this study, we introduce MPDistil, a meta-policy distillation technique, that utilizes novel optimization strategies to foster both *collaboration* and *competition* during the fine-tuning of the teacher model in the meta-learning step. Additionally, we propose a curriculum learning framework for the student model in a competitive setup, in which the student model aims to outperform the teacher model by self-training on various tasks. Exhaustive experiments on SuperGLUE and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of MPDistil compared to 20 conventional KD and advanced MetaKD baselines, showing significant performance enhancements in the student model -- e.g., a distilled 6-layer BERT model outperforms a 12-layer BERT model on five out of six SuperGLUE tasks. Furthermore, MPDistil, while applied to a large language teacher model (DeBERTa-v2-xxlarge), significantly narrows the performance gap of its smaller student counterpart (DeBERTa-12) by just 4.6% on SuperGLUE. We further demonstrate how higher rewards and customized training curricula strengthen the student model and enhance generalizability.},

However, the lack of 3D awareness in the 2D diffusion model often destabilizes previous methods from generating a plausible 3D scene. To address this issue, we propose 3DFuse, a novel framework that incorporates 3D awareness into the pretrained 2D diffusion model, enhancing the robustness and 3D consistency of score distillation-based methods. Specifically, we introduce a consistency injection module which constructs a 3D point cloud from the text prompt and utilizes its projected depth map at given view as a condition for the diffusion model. The 2D diffusion model, through its generative capability, robustly infers dense structure from the sparse point cloud depth map and generates a geometrically consistent and coherent 3D scene. We also introduce a new technique called semantic coding that reduces semantic ambiguity of the text prompt for improved results. Our method can be easily adapted to various text-to-3D baselines, and we experimentally demonstrate how our method notably enhances the 3D consistency of generated scenes in comparison to previous baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance in geometric robustness and fidelity.},

(2021), the study on finding graph lottery tickets (GLT) has become one of the pivotal focus in the GNN community, inspiring researchers to discover sparser GLT while achieving comparable performance to original dense networks. In parallel, the graph structure has gained substantial attention as a crucial factor in GNN training dynamics, also elucidated by several recent studies. Despite this, contemporary studies on GLT, in general, have not fully exploited inherent pathways in the graph structure and identified tickets in an iterative manner, which is time-consuming and inefficient. To address these limitations, we introduce **TEDDY**, a one-shot edge sparsification framework that leverages structural information by incorporating *edge-degree* statistics. Following the edge sparsification, we encourage the parameter sparsity during training via simple projected gradient descent on the ℓ0 ball. Given the target sparsity levels for both the graph structure and the model parameters, our TEDDY facilitates efficient and rapid realization of GLT within a *single* training. Remarkably, our experimental results demonstrate that TEDDY significantly surpasses conventional iterative approaches in generalization, even when conducting one-shot sparsification that solely utilizes graph structures, without taking feature information into account.},

Forecasting of glucose trajectories based on CGM data holds the potential to substantially improve diabetes management, by both refining artificial pancreas systems and enabling individuals to make adjustments based on predictions to maintain optimal glycemic range. Despite numerous methods proposed for CGM-based glucose trajectory prediction, these methods are typically evaluated on small, private datasets, impeding reproducibility, further research, and practical adoption. The absence of standardized prediction tasks and systematic comparisons between methods has led to uncoordinated research efforts, obstructing the identification of optimal tools for tackling specific challenges. As a result, only a limited number of prediction methods have been implemented in clinical practice. To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive resource that provides: (1) a consolidated repository of curated publicly available CGM datasets to foster reproducibility and accessibility; (2) a standardized task list to unify research objectives and facilitate coordinated efforts; (3) a set of benchmark models with established baseline performance, enabling the research community to objectively gauge new methods' efficacy; (4) a detailed analysis of performance-influencing factors for model development. We anticipate these resources to propel collaborative research endeavors in the critical domain of CGM-based glucose predictions. Our code is available online at github.com/IrinaStatsLab/GlucoBench.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel interpretation technique to explain the behavior of structured output models, which simultaneously learn mappings between an input vector and a set of output variables. As a result of the complex relationships between the computational path of output variables in structured models, a feature may impact an output value via other output variables. We focus on one of the outputs as the target and try to find the most important features adopted by the structured model to decide on the target in each locality of the input space. We consider an arbitrary structured output model available as a black-box and argue that considering correlations among output variables can improve explanation quality. The goal is to train a function as an interpreter for the target output variable over the input space. We introduce an energy-based training process for the interpreter function, which effectively considers the structural information incorporated into the model to be explained. The proposed method's effectiveness is confirmed using various simulated and real data sets.},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated the significant potential of denoising diffusion models for generating human motion, including text-to-motion capabilities. However, these methods are restricted by the paucity of annotated motion data, a focus on single-person motions, and a lack of detailed control. In this paper, we introduce three forms of composition based on diffusion priors: sequential, parallel, and model composition. Using sequential composition, we tackle the challenge of long sequence generation. We introduce DoubleTake, an inference-time method with which we generate long animations consisting of sequences of prompted intervals and their transitions, using a prior trained only for short clips. Using parallel composition, we show promising steps toward two-person generation. Beginning with two fixed priors as well as a few two-person training examples, we learn a slim communication block, ComMDM, to coordinate interaction between the two resulting motions. Using model composition, we first train individual priors to complete motions that realize a prescribed motion for a given joint. We then introduce DiffusionBlending, an interpolation mechanism to effectively blend several such models to enable flexible and efficient fine-grained joint and trajectory-level control and editing.},

Our proposed architecture, {SPDER}, is a simple {MLP} that uses an activation function composed of a sinusoidal multiplied by a sublinear function, called the damping function. The sinusoidal enables the network to automatically learn the positional embedding of an input coordinate while the damping passes on the actual coordinate value by preventing it from being projected down to within a finite range of values. {SPDERs} speed up training by 10 times and converge to losses 1,500 to 50,000 times lower than that of the state-of-the-art for image representation. {SPDER} is also state-of-the-art in audio representation. The superior representation capability allows {SPDER} to also excel on multiple downstream tasks such as image super-resolution and video frame interpolation.},

In this paper, we propose to proactively generate a cryptographic certificate of privacy during training to forego such auditing limitations. We introduce Confidential-{DPproof}, a framework for Confidential Proof of Differentially Private Training, which enhances training with a certificate of the ({$\varepsilon$},{$\delta$})-{DP} guarantee. To obtain this certificate without revealing information about the training data or model, we design a customized zero-knowledge proof protocol tailored to the requirements introduced by differentially private training, including random noise addition and privacy amplification by subsampling. In experiments on {CIFAR-10}, Confidential-{DPproof} trains a model achieving state-of-the-art 91\% test accuracy with a certified privacy guarantee of ({$\varepsilon$}=0.55,{$\delta$}=10$^{-5}$)-{DP} in approximately 100 hours.},

Graph Neural Networks ({GNNs}) have shown empirical success for learning on static graphs, but they lack the ability to effectively learn from nodes and edges with different timestamps. Consequently, the prediction of future properties in temporal graphs remains a relatively under-explored area. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing a principled framework, named {GraphPulse}. The framework combines two important techniques for the analysis of temporal graphs within a Newtonian framework. First, we employ the Mapper method, a key tool in topological data analysis, to extract essential clustering information from graph nodes. Next, we harness the sequential modeling capabilities of Recurrent Neural Networks ({RNNs}) for temporal reasoning regarding the graph's evolution. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our model enhances the {ROC-AUC} metric by 10.2\% in comparison to the top-performing state-of-the-art method across various temporal networks.},

@inproceedings{shao2024omniquant,
  abstract = {Large language models ({LLMs}) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. However, their practical deployment is hindered by their immense memory and computation requirements. Although recent post-training quantization ({PTQ}) methods are effective in reducing memory footprint and improving the computational efficiency of {LLM}, they hand-craft quantization parameters, leading to low performance, especially in extremely low-bit quantization. To tackle this issue, we introduce an Omnidirectionally calibrated Quantization ({OmniQuant}) technique for {LLMs}, which achieves good performance in diverse quantization settings while maintaining the computational efficiency of {PTQ} by efficiently optimizing various quantization parameters. {OmniQuant} comprises two innovative components including Learnable Weight Clipping ({LWC}) and Learnable Equivalent Transformation ({LET}). {LWC} modulates the extreme values of weights by optimizing the clipping threshold. Meanwhile, {LET} tackles activation outliers by shifting the challenge of quantization from activations to weights through a learnable equivalent transformation. Operating within a differentiable framework using block-wise error minimization, {OmniQuant} can optimize the quantization process efficiently for both weight-only and weight-activation quantization. For instance, the {LLaMA-2} model family size 7-70B can be processed with {OmniQuant} on a single A100-40G {GPU} within 1-16 hours using 128 samples. Extensive experiments validate {OmniQuant}'s superior performance across diverse quantization configurations such as W4A4 (4-bit weight, 4-bit activation), W6A6, W4A16, W3A16, and W2A16. Additionally, {OmniQuant} demonstrates effectiveness in instruction-tuned models and delivers notable improvements in inference speed and memory reduction on real devices.},

This simple intervention, which we call {LAyer-SElective} Rank reduction ({LASER}), can be done on a model after training has completed, and requires no additional parameters or data.

  abstract = {Self-supervised learning through contrastive representations is an emergent and promising avenue, aiming at alleviating the availability of labeled data. Recent research in the field also demonstrates its viability for several downstream tasks, henceforth leading to works that implement the contrastive principle through innovative loss functions and methods. However, despite achieving impressive progress, most methods depend on prohibitively large batch sizes and compute requirements for good performance. In this work, we propose the {AUC-Contrastive} Learning, a new approach to contrastive learning that demonstrates robust and competitive performance in compute-limited regimes. We propose to incorporate the contrastive objective within the {AUC-maximization} framework, by noting that the {AUC} metric is maximized upon enhancing the probability of the network's binary prediction difference between positive and negative samples which inspires adequate embedding space arrangements in representation learning. Unlike standard contrastive methods, when performing stochastic optimization, our method maintains unbiased stochastic gradients and thus is more robust to batchsizes as opposed to standard stochastic optimization problems. Remarkably, our method with a batch size of 256, outperforms several state-of-the-art methods that may need much larger batch sizes (e.g., 4096), on {ImageNet} and other standard datasets.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning from human feedback ({RLHF}) is a popular technique for training high-quality {AI} assistants. However, {RLHF} may also encourage model responses that match user beliefs over truthful responses, a behavior known as sycophancy. We investigate the prevalence of sycophancy in {RLHF}-trained models and whether human preference judgments are responsible. We first demonstrate that five state-of-the-art {AI} assistants consistently exhibit sycophancy behavior across four varied free-form text-generation tasks. To understand if human preferences drive this broadly observed behavior of {RLHF} models, we analyze existing human preference data. We find that when a response matches a user's views, it is more likely to be preferred. Moreover, both humans and preference models ({PMs}) prefer convincingly-written sycophantic responses over correct ones a non-negligible fraction of the time. Optimizing model outputs against {PMs} also sometimes sacrifices truthfulness in favor of sycophancy. Overall, our results indicate that sycophancy is a general behavior of {RLHF} models, likely driven in part by human preference judgments favoring sycophantic responses.},

@inproceedings{shaul2024bespoke,
  abstract = {Diffusion or flow-based models are powerful generative paradigms that are notoriously hard to sample as samples are defined as solutions to high-dimensional Ordinary or Stochastic Differential Equations ({ODEs}/{SDEs}) which require a large Number of Function Evaluations ({NFE}) to approximate well. Existing methods to alleviate the costly sampling process include model distillation and designing dedicated {ODE} solvers. However, distillation is costly to train and sometimes can deteriorate quality, while dedicated solvers still require relatively large {NFE} to produce high quality samples. In this paper we introduce ``Bespoke solvers'', a novel framework for constructing custom {ODE} solvers tailored to the {ODE} of a given pre-trained flow model. Our approach optimizes an order consistent and parameter-efficient solver (e.g., with 80 learnable parameters), is trained for roughly 1\% of the {GPU} time required for training the pre-trained model, and significantly improves approximation and generation quality compared to dedicated solvers. For example, a Bespoke solver for a {CIFAR10} model produces samples with Frchet Inception Distance ({FID}) of 2.73 with 10 {NFE}, and gets to 1\% of the Ground Truth ({GT}) {FID} (2.59) for this model with only 20 {NFE}. On the more challenging {ImageNet}-64×64, Bespoke samples at 2.2 {FID} with 10 {NFE}, and gets within 2\% of {GT} {FID} (1.71) with 20 {NFE}.},

However, generalization during fine-tuning is often more dependent on the transferability of representations in the function space. Trust-region methods (TR) target this goal by regularizing representation curvature to reduce catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained task-agnostic information while adopting task-specific skills. We consider unifying these strategies for low curvature in both parameter space and function space to improve out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. We propose Trust Region Aware Minimization (TRAM), a SAM algorithm fine-tuning for low parameter sharpness and smooth, informative representations preserving pre-trained structure. TRAM uses a trust region bound to inform the SAM adversarial neighborhood, introducing an awareness of function curvature within optimization for flatter minima.},

However, we currently have no way to know which data of these types is included or in what proportions. In this paper, we study the pretraining data detection problem: given a piece of text and black-box access to an LLM without knowing the pretraining data, can we determine if the model was trained on the provided text? To facilitate this study, we introduce a dynamic benchmark WIKIMIA that uses data created before and after model training to support gold truth detection. We also introduce a new detection method MIN-K PROB based on a simple hypothesis: an unseen example is likely to contain a few outlier words with low probabilities under the LLM, while a seen example is less likely to have words with such low probabilities.},

However, PT introduces additional soft prompt tokens, leading to longer input sequences, which significantly impacts training and inference time and memory usage due to the Transformer's quadratic complexity.

We instead present In-Context Pretraining, a new approach where language models are pretrained on a sequence of related documents, thereby explicitly encouraging them to read and reason across document boundaries. We can do In-Context Pretraining by simply changing the document ordering so that each context contains related documents, and directly applying existing pretraining pipelines.

While Zero-1-to-3 has demonstrated impressive zero-shot open-set NVS capability, it treats NVS as a pure image-to-image translation problem. This approach suffers from the challengingly under-constrained nature of single-view NVS: the process lacks means of explicit user control and often results in implausible NVS generations. To address this limitation, TOSS uses text as high-level semantic information to constrain the NVS solution space. TOSS fine-tunes text-to-image Stable Diffusion pre-trained on large-scale text-image pairs and introduces modules specifically tailored to image and camera pose conditioning, as well as dedicated training for pose correctness and preservation of fine details. Comprehensive experiments are conducted with results showing that the proposed TOSS outperforms Zero-1-to-3 with more plausible, controllable and multiview-consistent NVS results.

Previous studies have demonstrated the advantages of each approach in specific scenarios. CL, resembling supervised pre-training, excels at capturing longer-range global patterns and enhancing feature discrimination, while MIM is adept at introducing local and diverse attention across transformer layers. Considering the respective strengths, previous studies utilize feature distillation to inherit both discrimination and diversity. In this paper, we thoroughly examine previous feature distillation methods and observe that the increase in diversity mainly stems from asymmetric designs, which may in turn compromise discrimination. Hybrid Distill emulates the token relations of the MIM teacher at intermediate layers for diversity, while simultaneously distilling the final features of the CL teacher to enhance discrimination. A progressive redundant token masking strategy is employed to reduce the expenses associated with distillation and aid in preventing the model from converging to local optima. Experimental results demonstrate that Hybrid Distill achieves superior performance on various benchmark datasets.},

Our research leverages the Kalman filtering paradigm to introduce a novel and scalable sampling algorithm called Langevinized Kalman Temporal-Difference (LKTD) for deep reinforcement learning. This algorithm, grounded in Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC), efficiently draws samples from the posterior distribution of deep neural network parameters. Under mild conditions, we prove that the posterior samples generated by the LKTD algorithm converge to a stationary distribution. This convergence not only enables us to quantify uncertainties associated with the value function and model parameters but also allows us to monitor these uncertainties during policy updates throughout the training phase.

First, we show that any non-independent leverage score sampling method that obeys a weak one-sided ℓ∞ independence condition (which includes pivotal sampling) can actively learn d dimensional linear functions with O(d log d) samples, matching independent sampling.},

  abstract = {The objective of domain generalization (DG) is to enhance the transferability of the model learned from a source domain to unobserved domains. To prevent overfitting to a specific domain, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) reduces source domain's loss sharpness. However, we point out that there is still room for SAM to improve generalization to unknown domain. While SAM can reduce the source domain's loss sharpness, we highlight that there is potential for further improvement in generalizing to unknown domains. As unknown domains are inaccessible, these domains are empirically crafted by perturbing instances from the source domain dataset. We then propose Unknown Domain Inconsistency Minimization (UDIM), which seeks to reduce the loss landscape inconsistency between source and unknown domains. Our approach aims to align loss landscapes between source and perturbed domains to achieve better generalization.},

An idempotent operator is one that can be applied sequentially without changing the result beyond the initial application, namely f(f(z))=f(z). The proposed model f is trained to map a source distribution (e.g, Gaussian noise) to a target distribution (e.g. realistic images) using the following objectives: (1) Instances from the target distribution should map to themselves, namely f(x)=x. The target manifold is defined as the set of all instances that f maps to themselves. (2) Instances from the source distribution should map onto the defined target manifold, achieved by optimizing the idempotence term f(f(z))=f(z) which encourages the range of f(z) to be on the target manifold.},

Similar success in atomic property prediction has been limited due to the challenges of training effective models across multiple chemical domains.

Our combined training dataset consists of ~120M systems from OC20, OC22, ANI-1x, and Transition-1x. We evaluate performance and generalization by fine-tuning over a diverse set of downstream tasks and datasets including: QM9, rMD17, MatBench, QMOF, SPICE, and MD22. JMP demonstrates an average improvement of 59% over training from scratch and matches or sets state-of-the-art on 34 out of 40 tasks.

  abstract = {Unsupervised domain translation (UDT) aims to find functions that convert samples from one domain (e.g., sketches) to another domain (e.g., photos) without changing the high-level semantic meaning (also referred to as "content"). The translation functions are often sought by probability distribution matching of the transformed source domain and target domain. CycleGAN stands as arguably the most representative approach among this line of work. However, it was noticed in the literature that CycleGAN and variants could fail to identify the desired translation functions and produce content-misaligned translations. This limitation arises due to the presence of multiple translation functions—referred to as "measure-preserving automorphism" (MPA)—in the solution space of the learning criteria. This study delves into the core identifiability inquiry and introduces an MPA elimination theory. Our analysis shows that MPA is unlikely to exist, if multiple pairs of diverse cross-domain conditional distributions are matched by the learning function. Based on this analysis, we introduce a UDT learning approach using distribution matching over auxiliary variable-induced subsets of the domains, which is theoretically more appealing than prior work. To our best knowledge, the identifiability result stands as the first of its kind, without using restrictive conditions on the structure of the desired translation functions.},

We evaluate 10 open-source LMMs ranging from 3B to 80B parameters, and explore in-context learning (ICL) as a training-free solution to address model limitations. Our findings reveal that scaling alone does not resolve fundamental model flaws, and ICL's effects are nuanced - while improving explainability and abstention capabilities, ICL slightly improves instruction following, does not enhance compositional abilities, and may even amplify hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose novel ICL variants including Multitask-ICL, Chain-of-Hindsight-ICL, and Self-Correcting-ICL, which show promise as post-hoc approaches to efficiently tackle some limitations of current LMMs.},

We propose a novel algorithm for constructing prediction sets with PAC guarantees in the label shift setting, where the probabilities of labels can differ between the source and target distributions. Our algorithm relies on estimating the predicted probabilities of classes in the target domain and constructing confidence intervals for importance weights by propagating uncertainty through a Gaussian elimination algorithm. We evaluate our approach on five diverse datasets including CIFAR-10, ChestX-Ray, Entity-13, CDC Heart, and AGNews, demonstrating that our algorithm satisfies the PAC guarantee while producing smaller, more informative prediction sets compared to several baselines.},

Offline GCRL is pivotal for developing generalist agents capable of leveraging pre-existing datasets to learn diverse and reusable skills without hand-engineering reward functions. However, contemporary approaches to GCRL based on supervised learning and contrastive learning are often suboptimal in the offline setting. An alternative perspective on GCRL optimizes for occupancy matching, but necessitates learning a discriminator, which subsequently serves as a pseudo-reward for downstream RL. We propose SMORE, a novel approach that casts GCRL under a new lens of mixture-distribution matching, leading to a discriminator-free method for performant offline goal-conditioned RL. SMORE learns scores or unnormalized densities representing the importance of taking an action at a state for reaching a particular goal. We show that SMORE can outperform state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin on robot manipulation and locomotion tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our discriminator-free occupancy matching approach.},

It has been shown that this objective can be represented as an optimization problem of state-action visitation distribution under linear constraints. The dual problem of this formulation, which we refer to as dual {RL}, is unconstrained and easier to optimize. In this work, we first cast several state-of-the-art offline {RL} and offline imitation learning ({IL}) algorithms as instances of dual {RL} approaches with shared structures. Such unification allows us to identify the root cause of the shortcomings of prior methods. For offline {IL}, our analysis shows that prior methods are based on a restrictive coverage assumption that greatly limits their performance in practice. To fix this limitation, we propose a new discriminator-free method {ReCOIL} that learns to imitate from arbitrary off-policy data to obtain near-expert performance. For offline {RL}, our analysis frames a recent offline {RL} method {XQL} in the dual framework, and we further propose a new method f-{DVL} that provides alternative choices to the {Gumbel} regression loss that fixes the known training instability issue of {XQL}. The performance improvements by both of our proposed methods, {ReCOIL} and f-{DVL}, in {IL} and {RL} are validated on an extensive suite of simulated robot locomotion and manipulation tasks.},

  abstract = {In our era of enormous neural networks, empirical progress has been driven by the philosophy that *more is better*. Recent deep learning practice has found repeatedly that larger model size, more data, and more computation (resulting in lower training loss) optimizing to near-interpolation improves performance. In this paper, we give theoretical backing to these empirical observations by showing that these three properties hold in random feature ({RF}) regression, a class of models equivalent to shallow networks with only the last layer trained. Concretely, we first show that the test risk of {RF} regression decreases monotonically with both the number of features and samples, provided the ridge penalty is tuned optimally. In particular, this implies that infinite width {RF} architectures are preferable to those of any finite width. We then proceed to demonstrate that, for a large class of tasks characterized by powerlaw eigenstructure, training to near-zero training loss is *obligatory*: near-optimal performance can *only* be achieved when the training error is much smaller than the test error. Grounding our theory in real-world data, we find empirically that standard computer vision tasks with convolutional neural kernels clearly fall into this class. Taken together, our results tell a simple, testable story of the benefits of overparameterization and overfitting in random feature models.},

In this paper, we propose a learning-based state-space approach to compute the solution operators to infinite-dimensional semilinear {PDE}s. We extend neural operator theory by exploiting the structure of semilinear {PDE}s and the theory of nonlinear observers in function spaces, developing a flexible recursive method that allows for both prediction and data assimilation by combining prediction and correction operations. We propose {NODA} (Neural Operators with Data Assimilation), which is a recursive {NO} approach that can be used for both estimation, when noisy measurement data is available, and prediction.

In this work, we propose a new practical threat model where the adversary relies on transfer attacks through publicly available surrogate models. We argue that this setting will become the most prevalent for security-sensitive applications in the future.

@inproceedings{siththaranjan2024distributional,
  abstract = {In practice, preference learning from human feedback depends on incomplete data with hidden context. Hidden context refers to data that affects the feedback received, but which is not represented in the data used to train a preference model. This captures common issues of data collection, such as having human annotators with varied preferences, cognitive processes that result in seemingly irrational behavior, and combining data labeled according to different criteria. We prove that standard applications of preference learning, including reinforcement learning from human feedback ({RLHF}), implicitly aggregate over hidden contexts according to a well-known voting rule called *{Borda} count*. We show this can produce counter-intuitive results that are very different from other methods which implicitly aggregate via expected utility. Furthermore, our analysis formalizes the way that preference learning from users with diverse values tacitly implements a social choice function. A key implication of this result is that annotators have an incentive to misreport their preferences in order to influence the learned model, leading to vulnerabilities in the deployment of {RLHF}. As a step towards mitigating these problems, we introduce a class of methods called *distributional preference learning* ({DPL}). {DPL} methods estimate a distribution of possible score values for each alternative in order to better account for hidden context. Experimental results indicate that applying {DPL} to {RLHF} for {LLM} chatbots identifies hidden context in the data and significantly reduces subsequent jailbreak vulnerability.},

@inproceedings{siyao2024duolando,
  abstract = {We introduce a novel task within the field of human motion generation, termed dance accompaniment, which necessitates the generation of responsive movements from a dance partner, the ``follower'', synchronized with the lead dancer's movements and the underlying musical rhythm. Unlike existing solo or group dance generation tasks, a duet dance scenario entails a heightened degree of interaction between the two participants, requiring delicate coordination in both pose and position. To support this task, we first built a large-scale and diverse duet interactive dance dataset, {DD100}, by recording about 117 minutes of professional dancers' performances. To address the challenges inherent in this task, we propose a {GPT}-based model, Duolando, which autoregressively predicts the subsequent tokenized motion conditioned on the coordinated information of the music, the leader's and the follower's movements. To further enhance the {GPT}'s capabilities of generating stable results on unseen conditions (music and leader motions), we devise an off-policy reinforcement learning strategy that allows the model to explore viable trajectories from out-of-distribution samplings, guided by human-defined rewards. Based on the collected dataset and proposed method, we establish a benchmark with several carefully designed metrics.},

@inproceedings{skalse2024quantifying,
  abstract = {Inverse reinforcement learning ({IRL}) aims to infer an agent's preferences (represented as a reward function $R$) from their behaviour (represented as a policy $\pi$). To do this, we need a behavioural model of how $\pi$ relates to $R$. In the current literature, the most common behavioural models are optimality, {Boltzmann}-rationality, and causal entropy maximisation. However, the true relationship between a human's preferences and their behaviour is much more complex than any of these behavioural models. This means that the behavioural models are misspecified, which raises the concern that they may lead to systematic errors if applied to real data. In this paper, we analyse how sensitive the {IRL} problem is to misspecification of the behavioural model. Specifically, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions that completely characterise how the observed data may differ from the assumed behavioural model without incurring an error above a given threshold. In addition to this, we also characterise the conditions under which a behavioural model is robust to small perturbations of the observed policy, and we analyse how robust many behavioural models are to misspecification of their parameter values (such as e.g. the discount rate). Our analysis suggests that the {IRL} problem is highly sensitive to misspecification, in the sense that very mild misspecification can lead to very large errors in the inferred reward function.},

@inproceedings{skalse2024starc,
  abstract = {In order to solve a task using reinforcement learning, it is necessary to first formalise the goal of that task as a reward function. However, for many real-world tasks, it is very difficult to manually specify a reward function that never incentivises undesirable behaviour. As a result, it is increasingly popular to use reward learning algorithms, which attempt to learn a reward function from data. However, the theoretical foundations of reward learning are not yet well-developed. In particular, it is typically not known when a given reward learning algorithm with high probability will learn a reward function that is safe to optimise. This means that reward learning algorithms generally must be evaluated empirically, which is expensive, and that their failure modes are difficult to anticipate in advance. One of the roadblocks to deriving better theoretical guarantees is the lack of good methods for quantifying the difference between reward functions. In this paper we provide a solution to this problem, in the form of a class of pseudometrics on the space of all reward functions that we call {STARC} ({STAndardised} Reward Comparison) metrics. We show that {STARC} metrics induce both an upper and a lower bound on worst-case regret, which implies that our metrics are tight, and that any metric with the same properties must be bilipschitz equivalent to ours. Moreover, we also identify a number of issues with reward metrics proposed by earlier works. Finally, we evaluate our metrics empirically, to demonstrate their practical efficacy.},

@inproceedings{sokota2024updateequivalence,
  abstract = {The process of revising (or constructing) a policy at execution time---known as decision-time planning---has been key to achieving superhuman performance in perfect-information games like chess and Go. A recent line of work has extended decision-time planning to imperfect-information games, leading to superhuman performance in poker. However, these methods involve solving subgames whose sizes grow quickly in the amount of non-public information, making them unhelpful when the amount of non-public information is large. Motivated by this issue, we introduce an alternative framework for decision-time planning that is not based on solving subgames, but rather on update equivalence. In this update-equivalence framework, decision-time planning algorithms replicate the updates of last-iterate algorithms, which need not rely on public information. This facilitates scalability to games with large amounts of non-public information. Using this framework, we derive a provably sound search algorithm for fully cooperative games based on mirror descent and a search algorithm for adversarial games based on magnetic mirror descent. We validate the performance of these algorithms in cooperative and adversarial domains, notably in Hanabi, the standard benchmark for search in fully cooperative imperfect-information games. Here, our mirror descent approach exceeds or matches the performance of public information-based search while using two orders of magnitude less search time. This is the first instance of a non-public-information-based algorithm outperforming public-information-based approaches in a domain they have historically dominated.},

@inproceedings{solonets2024analytical,
  abstract = {Direct image alignment is a widely used technique for relative 6DoF pose estimation between two images, but its accuracy strongly depends on pose initialization. Therefore, recent end-to-end frameworks increase the convergence basin of the learned feature descriptors with special training objectives, such as the Gauss-Newton loss. However, the training data may exhibit bias toward a specific type of motion and pose initialization, thus limiting the generalization of these methods. In this work, we derive a closed-form solution to the expected optimum of the Gauss-Newton loss. The solution is agnostic to the underlying feature representation and allows us to dynamically adjust the basin of convergence according to our assumptions about the uncertainty in the current estimates. These properties allow for effective control over the convergence in the alignment process. Despite using self-supervised feature embeddings, our solution achieves compelling accuracy w.r.t. the state-of-the-art direct image alignment methods trained end-to-end with pose supervision, and demonstrates improved robustness to pose initialization. Our analytical solution exposes some inherent limitations of end-to-end learning with the Gauss-Newton loss, and establishes an intriguing connection between direct image alignment and feature-matching approaches.},

As an application, we consider employers that seek to anticipate the strategic response of a labor force when developing a hiring policy. We show theoretically that employers with performatively optimal hiring policies improve employer reward, labor force skill level, and labor force equity (compared to employers that do not anticipate the strategic labor force response) in the classic Coate-Loury labor market model. Empirically, we show that these desirable properties of performative hiring policies do generalize to our own formulation of a general equilibrium labor market. On the other hand, we also observe that the benefits of performatively optimal hiring policies are brittle in some aspects. We demonstrate that in our formulation a performative employer both harms workers by reducing their aggregate welfare and fails to prevent discrimination when more sophisticated wage and cost structures are introduced.},

State-of-the-art graph pooling methods follow a hierarchical approach, which reduces the graph size step-by-step. These methods must balance memory efficiency with preserving node information, depending on whether they use node dropping or node clustering. Additionally, fixed pooling ratios or numbers of pooling layers are predefined for all graphs, which prevents personalized pooling structures from being captured for each individual graph. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from bottom-up grammar induction and propose an efficient parsing algorithm to infer the graph pooling structure. This structure is then used to enable the model to learn personalized pooling structure for each individual graph. We demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms existing graph pooling methods across diverse graph learning tasks, including graph classification, node classification, and graph reconstruction. Further analysis shows that our method can learn meaningful hierarchical graph structures that reflect the underlying graph properties.},

@inproceedings{song2024improved,
  abstract = {Consistency models are a nascent family of generative models that can sample high quality data in one step without the need for adversarial training. Current consistency models achieve optimal sample quality by distilling from pre-trained diffusion models and employing learned metrics such as LPIPS. However, distillation limits the quality of consistency models to that of the pre-trained diffusion model, and LPIPS causes undesirable bias in evaluation. To tackle these challenges, we present improved techniques for consistency training, where consistency models learn directly from data without distillation. We identify a previously overlooked flaw and address it by eliminating Exponential Moving Average from the teacher consistency model. To replace learned metrics like LPIPS, we adopt Pseudo-Huber losses from robust statistics. We introduce a lognormal noise schedule for the consistency training objective, and propose to double total discretization steps every set number of training iterations. Combined with better hyperparameter tuning, these modifications enable consistency models to achieve FID scores of 2.51 and 3.25 on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 64×64 respectively in a single sampling step. These scores mark a 3.5× and 4× improvement compared to prior consistency training approaches. Through two-step sampling, we further reduce FID scores to 2.24 and 2.77 on these two datasets, surpassing those obtained via distillation.},

COCOA seeks both in-distribution anchors and differences by utilizing a learned reverse dynamics model, encouraging conservatism in the compositional input space for the policy or value function. Such compositional conservatism is independent of and agnostic to the prevalent behavioral conservatism in offline RL.

  abstract = {While large language models (LLMs) equipped with techniques like chain-of-thought prompting have demonstrated impressive capabilities, they still fall short in their ability to reason robustly in complex settings. However, evaluating LLM reasoning is challenging because system capabilities continue to grow while benchmark datasets for tasks like logical deduction have remained static. We introduce MuSR, a dataset for evaluating language models on multistep soft reasoning tasks specified in a natural language narrative. This dataset has two crucial features. First, it is created through a novel neurosymbolic synthetic-to-natural generation algorithm, enabling the construction of complex reasoning instances that challenge GPT-4 (e.g., murder mysteries roughly 1000 words in length) and which can be scaled further as more capable LLMs are released. Second, our dataset instances are free text narratives corresponding to real-world domains of reasoning; this makes it simultaneously much more challenging than other synthetically-crafted benchmarks while remaining realistic and tractable for human annotators to solve with high accuracy. We evaluate a range of LLMs and prompting techniques on this dataset and characterize the gaps that remain for techniques like chain-of-thought to perform robust reasoning.},

  abstract = {Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has emerged as a promising alternative optimizer to stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The originally-proposed motivation behind SAM was to bias neural networks towards flatter minima that are believed to generalize better. However, recent studies have shown conflicting evidence on the relationship between flatness and generalization, suggesting that flatness does fully explain SAM's success. Sidestepping this debate, we identify an orthogonal effect of SAM that is beneficial out-of-distribution: we argue that SAM implicitly balances the quality of diverse features. SAM achieves this effect by adaptively suppressing well-learned features which gives remaining features opportunity to be learned. We show that this mechanism is beneficial in datasets that contain redundant or spurious features where SGD falls for the simplicity bias and would not otherwise learn all available features. Our insights are supported by experiments on real data: we demonstrate that SAM improves the quality of features in datasets containing redundant or spurious features, including CelebA, Waterbirds, CIFAR-MNIST, and DomainBed.},

  abstract = {Imitation learning considerably simplifies policy synthesis compared to alternative approaches by exploiting access to expert demonstrations. For such imitation policies, errors away from the training samples are particularly critical. Even rare slip-ups in the policy action outputs can compound quickly over time, since they lead to unfamiliar future states where the policy is still more likely to err, eventually causing task failures. We revisit simple supervised 'behavior cloning' for conveniently training the policy from nothing more than pre-recorded demonstrations, but carefully design the model class to counter the compounding error phenomenon. Our 'memory-consistent neural network' (MCNN) outputs are hard-constrained to stay within clearly specified permissible regions anchored to prototypical 'memory' training samples. We provide a guaranteed upper bound for the sub-optimality gap induced by MCNN policies. Using MCNNs on 10 imitation learning tasks, with MLP, Transformer, and Diffusion backbones, spanning dexterous robotic manipulation and driving, proprioceptive inputs and visual inputs, and varying sizes and types of demonstration data, we find large and consistent gains in performance, validating that MCNNs are better-suited than vanilla deep neural networks for imitation learning applications.},

Here, we first address compelling challenges related to the "forward-only" rules, which include reducing the performance gap with backpropagation and providing an analytical understanding of their dynamics. To this end, we show that the forward-only algorithm with top-down feedback is well-approximated by an "adaptive-feedback-alignment" algorithm, and we analytically track its performance during learning in a prototype high-dimensional setting. Then, we compare different versions of forward-only algorithms, focusing on the Forward-Forward and PEPITA frameworks, and we show that they share the same learning principles. Overall, our work unveils the connections between three key neuro-inspired learning rules, providing a link between "forward-only" algorithms, i.e., Forward-Forward and PEPITA, and an approximation of backpropagation, i.e., Feedback Alignment.},

We address this task with a multimodal model that conditions on both textual information from the associated social media post as well as visual signal from the image, and demonstrate that the utility of these two information sources stacks. We put forward a new dataset of 371k images paired with alt-text and tweets scraped from Twitter and evaluate on it across a variety of automated metrics as well as human evaluation. We show that our approach of conditioning on both tweet text and visual information significantly outperforms prior work, by more than 2x on BLEU@4.},

  abstract = {Current privacy research on large language models (LLMs) primarily focuses on the issue of extracting memorized training data. At the same time, models' inference capabilities have increased drastically. This raises the key question of whether current LLMs could violate individuals' privacy by inferring personal attributes from text given at inference time. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study on the capabilities of pretrained LLMs to infer personal attributes from text. We construct a dataset consisting of real Reddit profiles, and show that current LLMs can infer a wide range of personal attributes (e.g., location, income, sex), achieving up to $85\%$ top-1 and $95\%$ top-3 accuracy at a fraction of the cost ($100\times$) and time ($240\times$) required by humans. As people increasingly interact with LLM-powered chatbots across all aspects of life, we also explore the emerging threat of privacy-invasive chatbots trying to extract personal information through seemingly benign questions. Finally, we show that common mitigations, i.e., text anonymization and model alignment, are currently ineffective at protecting user privacy against LLM inference. Our findings highlight that current LLMs can infer personal data at a previously unattainable scale. In the absence of working defenses, we advocate for a broader discussion around LLM privacy implications beyond memorization, striving for a wider privacy protection.},

TTE models are used for estimating the probability distribution of the time until a specific event occurs, which is an important task in medical settings. TTE models provide many advantages over classification using fixed time horizons, including naturally handling censored observations, but are challenging to train with limited labeled data. MOTOR addresses this challenge by pretraining on up to 55M patient records (9B clinical events). We evaluate MOTOR's transfer learning performance on 19 tasks, across 3 patient databases (a private EHR system, MIMIC-IV, and Merative claims data). Task-specific models adapted from MOTOR improve time-dependent C statistics by 4.6% over state-of-the-art, improve label efficiency by up to 95%, and are more robust to temporal distributional shifts. We further evaluate cross-site portability by adapting our MOTOR foundation model for six prediction tasks on the MIMIC-IV dataset, where it outperforms all baselines. MOTOR is the first foundation model for medical TTE predictions and we release a 143M parameter pretrained model for research use.},

We attempt to address this shortcoming by introducing AmP, a framework, dataset, and challenge for translating ambiguous natural language to formal representations like logic and code. We define templates and generate data for five well-documented linguistic ambiguities. Using AmP, we investigate how several few-shot text-to-code systems handle ambiguity, introducing three new metrics. We find that large pre-trained models perform poorly at capturing the distribution of possible meanings without deliberate instruction. However, models are able to capture the distribution well when ambiguity is attested in their inputs. These results motivate a call for including ambiguity explicitly in datasets and promote considering the distribution of possible outputs when evaluating systems.},

  abstract = {Deep Generative Models (DGMs) have been shown to be powerful tools for generating tabular data, as they have been increasingly able to capture the complex distributions that characterize them. However, to generate realistic synthetic data, it is often not enough to have a good approximation of their distribution, as it also requires compliance with constraints that encode essential background knowledge on the problem at hand. In this paper, we address this limitation and show how DGMs for tabular data can be transformed into Constrained Deep Generative Models (C-DGMs), whose generated samples are guaranteed to be compliant with the given constraints. This is achieved by automatically parsing the constraints and transforming them into a Constraint Layer (CL) seamlessly integrated with the DGM. Our extensive experimental analysis with various DGMs and tasks reveals that standard DGMs often violate constraints, some exceeding 95% non-compliance, while their corresponding C-DGMs are never non-compliant. Then, we quantitatively demonstrate that, at training time, C-DGMs are able to exploit the background knowledge expressed by the constraints to outperform their standard counterparts with up to 6.5% improvement in utility and detection. Further, we show how our CL does not necessarily need to be integrated at training time, as it can be also used as a guardrail at inference time, still producing some improvements in the overall performance of the models. Finally, we show that our CL does not hinder the sample generation time of the models.},

In this paper, we tackle the extremely difficult problem of combining distinct models with different initializations, each solving a separate task, into one multi-task model without any additional training. Prior work in model merging permutes one model to the space of the other then averages them together. While this works for models trained on the same task, we find that this fails to account for the differences in models trained on disjoint tasks. Thus, we introduce "ZipIt!", a general method for merging two arbitrary models of the same architecture that incorporates two simple strategies. First, in order to account for features that aren't shared between models, we expand the model merging problem to allow for merging features within each model by defining a general "zip" operation. Second, we add support for partially zipping the models up until a specified layer, naturally creating a multi-head model. Compared to prior work, these two changes combined account for 20-60% improvement over prior work, and can zip models that couldn't previously be merged at all.},

Its implications for preserving model privacy, however, have remained unexplored. To fill this gap, we investigate the impact of label smoothing on model inversion attacks ({MIAs}), which aim to generate class-representative samples by exploiting the knowledge encoded in a classifier, thereby inferring sensitive information about its training data. Through extensive analyses, we uncover that traditional label smoothing fosters {MIAs}, thereby increasing a model's privacy leakage. Even more, we reveal that smoothing with negative factors counters this trend, impeding the extraction of class-related information and leading to privacy preservation, beating state-of-the-art defenses. This establishes a practical and powerful novel way for enhancing model resilience against {MIAs}.},

We identify a previously overlooked objective of query dependency in such optimization and elucidate two ensuing challenges: the absence of an effective method to evaluate prompts during inference when the golden answer is unavailable, and the learning via interactions with {LLMs} to navigate the expansive natural language prompting space proves to be resource-intensive. To address this, we introduce Prompt-{OIRL}, which harnesses offline inverse reinforcement learning to draw insights from offline prompting demonstration data. This approach seeks to bridge the gap between effective prompt evaluation and affordability by drawing on offline datasets from expert evaluations, employing Inverse-{RL} to derive a reward model for offline, query-dependent prompt evaluations.},

Conformal prediction is a distribution-free uncertainty quantification framework popular for its ease of implementation, finite-sample coverage guarantees, and generality for underlying prediction algorithms. However, existing conformal prediction approaches for time series are limited to single-step prediction without considering the temporal dependency. In this paper, we propose the Copula Conformal Prediction algorithm for multivariate, multi-step Time Series forecasting, CopulaCPTS. The key insight of our algorithm is that we can model the joint probability of uncertainty for multiple predicted time steps with a copula, hence better capturing the confidence regions. We prove that CopulaCPTS has finite sample validity guarantee. On several synthetic and real-world multivariate time series datasets, we show that CopulaCPTS produces more calibrated and sharp confidence intervals for multi-step prediction tasks than existing techniques.},

This omnivore model can take in any single-modality or multimodal data input indiscriminately (e.g., interleaved image, text and video) through a one-model-for-all autoregressive training process. First, visual signals are encoded into embeddings, and together with text tokens form an interleaved input sequence. Emu is then end-to-end trained with a unified objective of classifying the next text token or regressing the next visual embedding in the multimodal sequence. This versatile multimodality empowers the exploration of diverse pretraining data sources at scale, such as videos with interleaved frames and text, webpages with interleaved images and text, as well as web-scale image-text pairs and video-text pairs. Emu can serve as a generalist multimodal interface for both image-to-text and text-to-image tasks, and supports in-context image and text generation. Across a broad range of zero-shot/few-shot tasks including image captioning, visual question answering, video question answering and text-to-image generation, Emu demonstrates superb performance compared to state-of-the-art large multimodal models.},

Within the Alice benchmarks, two object re-ID tasks are offered: person and vehicle re-ID. We collected and annotated two challenging real-world target datasets: AlicePerson and AliceVehicle, captured under various illuminations, image resolutions, etc. As an important feature of our real target, the clusterability of its training set is not manually guaranteed to make it closer to a real domain adaptation test scenario. Correspondingly, we reuse existing PersonX and VehicleX as synthetic source domains. The primary goal is to train models from synthetic data that can work effectively in the real world.},

@inproceedings{sun2024backdoor,
  abstract = {Contrastive Learning (CL) has attracted enormous attention due to its remarkable capability in unsupervised representation learning. However, recent works have revealed the vulnerability of CL to backdoor attacks: the feature extractor could be misled to embed backdoored data close to an attack target class, thus fooling the downstream predictor to misclassify it as the target. Existing attacks usually adopt a fixed trigger pattern and poison the training set with trigger-injected data, hoping for the feature extractor to learn the association between trigger and target class. However, we find that such fixed trigger design fails to effectively associate trigger-injected data with target class in the embedding space due to special CL mechanisms, leading to a limited attack success rate (ASR). This phenomenon motivates us to find a better backdoor trigger design tailored for CL framework. In this paper, we propose a bi-level optimization approach to achieve this goal, where the inner optimization simulates the CL dynamics of a surrogate victim, and the outer optimization enforces the backdoor trigger to stay close to the target throughout the surrogate CL procedure. Extensive experiments show that our attack can achieve a higher attack success rate (e.g., 99% ASR on ImageNet-100) with a very low poisoning rate (1%). Besides, our attack can effectively evade existing state-of-the-art defenses.},

However, its data-driven nature also introduces new vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious opponents. Recent work shows that a well-trained RL agent can be easily manipulated by strategically perturbing its state observations at the test stage. Existing solutions either introduce a regularization term to improve the smoothness of the trained policy against perturbations or alternatively train the agent's policy and the attacker's policy. However, the former does not provide sufficient protection against strong attacks, while the latter is computationally prohibitive for large environments. In this work, we propose a new robust RL algorithm for deriving a pessimistic policy to safeguard against an agent's uncertainty about true states.

Currently, overfitting remains a critical problem in event-based classification tasks for Spiking Neural Network (SNN) due to its relatively weak spatial representation capability. Data augmentation is a simple but efficient method to alleviate overfitting and improve the generalization ability of neural networks, and saliency-based augmentation methods are proven to be effective in the image processing field. However, there is no approach available for extracting saliency maps from SNNs. Therefore, for the first time, we present Spiking Layer-Time-wise Relevance Propagation rule (SLTRP) and Spiking Layer-wise Relevance Propagation rule (SLRP) in order for SNN to generate stable and accurate CAMs and saliency maps. Based on this, we propose EventRPG, which leverages relevance propagation on the spiking neural network for more efficient augmentation.

@inproceedings{sun2024dreamcraft3d,
  abstract = {We present DreamCraft3D, a hierarchical 3D content generation method that produces high-fidelity and coherent 3D objects. We tackle the problem by leveraging a 2D reference image to guide the stages of geometry sculpting and texture boosting. A central focus of this work is to address the consistency issue that existing works encounter. To sculpt geometries that render coherently, we perform score distillation sampling via a view-dependent diffusion model. This 3D prior, alongside several training strategies, prioritizes the geometry consistency but compromises the texture fidelity. We further propose bootstrapped score distillation to specifically boost the texture. We train a personalized diffusion model, Dreambooth, on the augmented renderings of the scene, imbuing it with 3D knowledge of the scene being optimized. The score distillation from this 3D-aware diffusion prior provides view-consistent guidance for the scene. Notably, through an alternating optimization of the diffusion prior and 3D scene representation, we achieve mutually reinforcing improvements: the optimized 3D scene aids in training the scene-specific diffusion model, which offers increasingly view-consistent guidance for 3D optimization. The optimization is thus bootstrapped and leads to substantial texture boosting. With tailored 3D priors throughout the hierarchical generation, DreamCraft3D generates coherent 3D objects with photorealistic renderings, advancing the state-of-the-art in 3D content generation.},

The desirability of self-supervised representation learning stems from the expensive and laborious process of annotating 2D and 3D data. Although previous research has investigated pretraining methods for both LiDAR and camera-based 3D object detection, a unified pretraining framework for multimodal BEV perception is missing. In this study, we introduce CALICO, a novel framework that applies contrastive objectives to both LiDAR and camera backbones. Specifically, CALICO incorporates two stages: point-region contrast (PRC) and region-aware distillation (RAD). PRC better balances the region- and scene-level representation learning on the LiDAR modality and offers significant performance improvement compared to existing methods. RAD effectively achieves contrastive distillation on our self-trained teacher model. CALICO's efficacy is substantiated by extensive evaluations on 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation tasks, where it delivers significant performance improvements. Notably, CALICO outperforms the baseline method by 10.5% and 8.6% on NDS and mAP. Moreover, CALICO boosts the robustness of multimodal 3D object detection against adversarial attacks and corruption. Additionally, our framework can be tailored to different backbones and heads, positioning it as a promising approach for multimodal BEV perception.},

  abstract = {Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can understand the world comprehensively by integrating rich information from different modalities, achieving remarkable advancements on various multimodal downstream tasks. However, deploying LVLMs is often problematic due to their massive computational/energy costs and carbon consumption. Such issues make it infeasible to adopt conventional iterative global pruning, which is costly due to computing the Hessian matrix of the entire large model for sparsification. Alternatively, several studies have recently proposed layer-wise pruning approaches to avoid the expensive computation of global pruning and efficiently compress model weights according to their importance within a layer. However, they often suffer from suboptimal model compression due to their lack of a global perspective. To address this limitation in recent efficient pruning methods for large models, we propose Efficient Coarse-to-Fine LayerWise Pruning (ECoFLaP), a two-stage coarse-to-fine weight pruning approach for LVLMs. We first determine the sparsity ratios of different layers or blocks by leveraging the global importance score, which is efficiently computed based on the zeroth-order approximation of the global model gradients. Then, the model performs local layer-wise unstructured weight pruning based on globally-informed sparsity ratios. We validate our proposed method across various multimodal and unimodal models and datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements over prevalent pruning techniques in the high-sparsity regime.},

  abstract = {In Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO), an agent intervenes on a structural causal model with known graph but unknown mechanisms to maximize a downstream reward variable. In this paper, we consider the generalization where other agents or external events also intervene on the system, which is key for enabling adaptiveness to non-stationarities such as weather changes, market forces, or adversaries. We formalize this generalization of CBO as Adversarial Causal Bayesian Optimization (ACBO) and introduce the first algorithm for ACBO with bounded regret: Causal Bayesian Optimization with Multiplicative Weights (CBO-MW). We derive regret bounds for CBO-MW that naturally depend on graph-related quantities. We further propose a scalable implementation for the case of combinatorial interventions and submodular rewards. Empirically, CBO-MW outperforms non-causal and non-adversarial Bayesian optimization methods on synthetic environments and environments based on real-world data. Our experiments include a realistic demonstration of how CBO-MW can be used to learn users' demand patterns in a shared mobility system and reposition vehicles in strategic areas.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks with feature learning have shown surprising generalization performance in high dimensional settings, but it has not been fully understood how and when they enjoy the benefit of feature learning. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the statistical properties of the benefits from feature learning in a two-layer linear neural network with multiple outputs in a high-dimensional setting. For that purpose, we propose a new criterion that allows feature learning of a two-layer linear neural network in a high-dimensional setting. Interestingly, we can show that models with smaller values of the criterion generalize even in situations where normal ridge regression fails to generalize. This is because the proposed criterion contains a proper regularization for the feature mapping and acts as an upper bound on the predictive risk. As an important characterization of the criterion, the two-layer linear neural network that minimizes this criterion can achieve the optimal Bayes risk that is determined by the distribution of the true signals across the multiple outputs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to specifically identify the conditions under which a model obtained by proper feature learning can outperform normal ridge regression in a high-dimensional multiple-output linear regression problem.},

We show that LLaRP is robust to complex paraphrasings of task instructions and can generalize to new tasks that require novel optimal behavior.

In this paper, we aim to unlock the potential of vanilla lightweight ViTs by exploring the adaptation of the widely-used re-parameterization technology to ViTs for improving learning ability during training without increasing the inference cost. The main challenge comes from the fact that CNNs perfectly complement the re-parameterization technology whereas ViTs present different architectural characteristics.

@inproceedings{tan2024true,
  abstract = {Despite the impressive performance across numerous tasks, large language models (LLMs) often fail in solving simple decision-making tasks due to the misalignment of the knowledge in LLMs with environments. On the contrary, reinforcement learning (RL) agents learn policies from scratch, which makes them always align with environments but difficult to incorporate prior knowledge for efficient explorations. To narrow the gap, we propose TWOSOME, a novel general online framework that deploys LLMs as decision-making agents to efficiently interact and align with embodied environments via RL without requiring a pre-trained policy. Specifically, we formulate the LLM as the policy network and initialize it with pre-trained weights. The policy network is optimized to maximize the return through RL training. We additionally propose a structured prompting approach that converts environmental observations to natural language to help with LLM training. Experiments on 6 RL environments ranging from classic control to robotics manipulation demonstrate that TWOSOME exhibits significantly better sample efficiency and performance compared to conventional RL methods like PPO and prompt tuning methods like SayCan. Moreover, benefiting from the open-vocabulary nature of LLMs, TWOSOME shows superior generalization ability to unseen tasks.},

Model fusion methods, such as task arithmetic, have been proven to be powerful and scalable to incorporate fine-tuned weights from different tasks into a multi-task model. However, efficiently fine-tuning large pre-trained models on multiple downstream tasks remains challenging, leading to inefficient multi-task model fusion. In this work, we propose a novel method to improve multi-task fusion for parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA fine-tuning. Specifically, our approach partially linearizes only the adapter modules and applies task arithmetic over the linearized adapters. This allows us to leverage the advantages of model fusion over linearized fine-tuning, while still performing fine-tuning and inference efficiently. We demonstrate that our partial linearization technique enables a more effective fusion of multiple tasks into a single model, outperforming standard adapter tuning and task arithmetic alone. Experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed partial linearization technique to effectively construct unified multi-task models via the fusion of fine-tuned task vectors.},

Recently, neural network approximation of PDEs has received increasing attention due to its flexible meshless discretization and its potential for high-dimensional problems. One fundamental numerical difficulty is that random samples in the training set introduce statistical errors into the discretization of the loss functional which may become the dominant error in the final approximation, and therefore overshadow the modeling capability of the neural network. In this work, we propose a new minmax formulation to optimize simultaneously the approximate solution, given by a neural network model, and the random samples in the training set. The key idea is to use a deep generative model to adjust the random samples in the training set such that the residual induced by the neural network model can maintain a smooth profile in the training process.},

In peripheral areas such as the prediction of molecular properties, fully connected attention networks have been shown to be successful.

In this work, we show that this infinitely connected attention can lead to a computationally tractable formulation, interpreted as neural potential summation, that performs infinite interatomic potential summations in a deeply learned feature space. We then propose a simple yet effective Transformer-based encoder architecture for crystal structures called Crystalformer.

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) can perform impressive feats with in-context learning or lightweight finetuning. It is natural to wonder how well these models adapt to genuinely new tasks, but how does one find tasks that are unseen in internet-scale training sets? We turn to a field that is explicitly motivated and bottlenecked by a scarcity of web data: low-resource languages. In this paper, we introduce MTOB (Machine Translation from One Book), a benchmark for learning to translate between English and Kalamang -- a language with less than 200 speakers and therefore virtually no presence on the web -- using several hundred pages of field linguistics reference materials. This task framing is novel in that it asks a model to learn a language from a single human-readable book of grammar explanations, rather than a large mined corpus of in-domain data, more akin to L2 learning than L1 acquisition. We demonstrate that baselines using current LLMs are promising but fall short of human performance, achieving 44.7 chrF on Kalamang to English translation and 45.8 chrF on English to Kalamang translation, compared to 51.6 and 57.0 chrF by a human who learned Kalamang from the same reference materials.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) presents a promising framework to learn policies through environment interaction, but often requires an infeasible amount of interaction data to solve complex tasks from sparse rewards. One direction includes augmenting RL with offline data demonstrating desired tasks, but past work often require a lot of high-quality demonstration data that is difficult to obtain, especially for domains such as robotics. Our approach consists of a reverse curriculum followed by a forward curriculum. Unique to our approach compared to past work is the ability to efficiently leverage more than one demonstration via a per-demonstration reverse curriculum generated via state resets. The result of our reverse curriculum is an initial policy that performs well on a narrow initial state distribution and helps overcome difficult exploration problems. A forward curriculum is then used to accelerate the training of the initial policy to perform well on the full initial state distribution of the task and improve demonstration and sample efficiency. We show how the combination of a reverse curriculum and forward curriculum in our method, RFCL, enables significant improvements in demonstration and sample efficiency compared against various state-of-the-art learning-from-demonstration baselines, even solving previously unsolvable tasks that require high precision and control.},

A popular approach towards obtaining such agents is to reuse skills learned in prior tasks to generalise compositionally to new ones. However, this is a challenging problem due to the curse of dimensionality induced by the combinatorially large number of ways high-level goals can be combined both logically and temporally in language. To address this problem, we propose a framework where an agent first learns a sufficient set of skill primitives to achieve all high-level goals in its environment. The agent can then flexibly compose them both logically and temporally to provably achieve temporal logic specifications in any regular language, such as regular fragments of linear temporal logic. This provides the agent with the ability to map from complex temporal logic task specifications to near-optimal behaviours zero-shot.},

Distributionally robust BO (DRBO) is a subset of BOCU that affords robustness against context distribution shift, and includes the optimization of expected values and worst-case values as special cases. By considering the first derivatives of the DRBO objective, we generalize DRBO to one that includes several other uncertainty objectives studied in the BOCU literature such as worst-case sensitivity (and thus notions of risk such as variance, range, and conditional value-at-risk) and mean-risk tradeoffs. We develop a general Thompson sampling algorithm that is able to optimize any objective within the BOCU framework, analyze its theoretical properties, and compare it to suitable baselines across different experimental settings and uncertainty objectives.},

Therefore, the diffusion process can continue seamlessly in any new resolution or model without restarting from pure noise or low-resolution conditioning.

This paper addresses the challenge of making such embeddings more interpretable and broadly useful, by employing large language models (LLMs) to directly interact with embeddings -- transforming abstract vectors into understandable narratives. By injecting embeddings into LLMs, we enable querying and exploration of complex embedding data.

Using causal mediation analysis on various in-context-learning tasks, the authors discover that a small number attention heads transport a compact representation of the demonstrated task, which they call a function vector (FV). Function vectors are robust to changes in context and trigger execution of the task on inputs such as zero-shot and natural text settings that do not resemble the ICL contexts from which they are collected. The study investigates the internal structure of FVs and finds that while they often contain information that encodes the output space of the function, this information alone is not sufficient to reconstruct an FV. They also test semantic vector composition in FVs, and find that to some extent they can be summed to create vectors that trigger new complex tasks.},

  abstract = {This study introduces a safe collaborative filtering method that prioritizes recommendation quality for less-satisfied users rather than focusing on the average performance. The approach minimizes the conditional value at risk (CVaR), which represents the average risk over the tails of users' loss. Excellent tail performance is crucial for modern machine learning tasks, such as algorithmic fairness, class imbalance, and risk-sensitive decision making, as it ensures the effective handling of challenging samples within a dataset. To overcome computational challenges for web-scale recommender systems, the authors developed a robust yet practical algorithm that extends the most scalable method, implicit alternating least squares (iALS). Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates the excellent tail performance of their approach while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.},

While recent works show potential for meta-learning PINNs across PDE configurations, PINN training has different difficulty levels depending on PDE configurations or residual sampling points, yet existing meta-learning approaches treat all PINN tasks equally. This paper introduces a novel difficulty-aware task sampler (DATS) for meta-learning of PINNs. The authors derive an optimal analytical solution to optimize the probability for sampling individual PINN tasks in order to minimize their validation loss across tasks. They present two alternative strategies to utilize this sampling probability to either adaptively weigh PINN tasks, or dynamically allocate optimal residual points across tasks. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that DATS improved the accuracy of meta-learned PINN solutions while reducing performance disparity across PDE configurations, using only a fraction of residual sampling budgets required by baselines.},

However, one critical assumption often goes overlooked: that of independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) test batches with respect to unknown labels. This oversight leads to skewed BN statistics and undermines the reliability of the model under non-i.i.d. scenarios. This paper presents Un-Mixing Test-Time Normalization Statistics (UnMix-TNS), which re-calibrates the statistics for each instance within a test batch by mixing it with multiple distinct statistics components, thus inherently simulating the i.i.d. scenario. The core of this method hinges on a distinctive online unmixing procedure that continuously updates these statistics components by incorporating the most similar instances from new test batches. Remarkably generic in its design, UnMix-TNS seamlessly integrates with a wide range of leading test-time adaptation methods and pre-trained architectures equipped with BN layers.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces Lagrangian Flow Networks (LFlows) for modeling fluid densities and velocities continuously in space and time. By construction, the proposed LFlows satisfy the continuity equation, a PDE describing mass conservation in its differentiable form. The model is based on the insight that solutions to the continuity equation can be expressed as time-dependent density transformations via differentiable and invertible maps, following from classical theory of the existence and uniqueness of Lagrangian flows for smooth vector fields. The method models fluid densities by transforming a base density with parameterized diffeomorphisms conditioned on time. The key benefit compared to methods relying on numerical ODE solvers or PINNs is that the analytic expression of the velocity is always consistent with changes in density. Furthermore, they require neither expensive numerical solvers, nor additional penalties to enforce the PDE. Experimental results show improved predictive accuracy on synthetic density modeling tasks in both 2D and 3D, with a real-world application of modeling bird migration based on sparse weather radar measurements.},

To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first dataset that includes both human-generated attacks and defenses for instruction-following LLMs. The attacks in the dataset have easily interpretable structure, and shed light on the weaknesses of LLMs. The dataset is used to create a benchmark for resistance to two types of prompt injection: prompt extraction and prompt hijacking. Benchmark results show that many models are vulnerable to the attack strategies in the Tensor Trust dataset. Furthermore, some attack strategies from the dataset generalize to deployed LLM-based applications, even though they have a very different set of constraints to the game.},

Despite its ubiquity, formal theoretical understanding of the principles of data augmentation remains limited, and practitioners rely on rules of thumb when applying augmentation policies. In this paper, we take a step toward formalizing data augmentation by studying its distributional effects. We argue that the diversity of the augmentation policy, defined as the range of transformations that a sample may undergo, is a key factor in the success of augmentation. In particular, we show that when the augmentation policy is more diverse, standard generalization bounds become tighter, and the augmentation-regularization trade-off is improved. Our method, called effective data augmentation (EDA), is a simple technique for generating diverse augmentations. Our method edits images to change their semantics using an off-the-shelf diffusion model, while preserving the original class label. We evaluate EDA on several computer vision benchmarks and show consistent improvements over baseline augmentation strategies.},

However, while it is well-known in computer vision that CI quality diminishes under distribution shift, this behavior remains understudied for GNNs. Hence, we begin with a case study on CI calibration under controlled structural and feature distribution shifts and demonstrate that increased expressivity or model size do not always lead to improved CI performance. Consequently, we instead advocate for the use of epistemic uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods to modulate CIs. To this end, we propose G-ΔUQ, a new single model UQ method that extends the recently proposed stochastic centering framework to support structured data and partial stochasticity. Evaluated across covariate, concept, and graph size shifts, G-ΔUQ not only outperforms several popular UQ methods in obtaining calibrated CIs, but also outperforms alternatives when CIs are used for generalization gap prediction or OOD detection. Overall, our work not only introduces a new, flexible GNN UQ method, but also provides novel insights into GNN CIs on safety-critical tasks.},

The existing codebook prior mitigates the ill-posedness by leveraging an autoencoder and learned codebook of high-quality (HQ) features, achieving remarkable quality. However, existing approaches in this paradigm frequently depend on a single encoder pre-trained on HQ data for restoring HQ images, disregarding the domain gap between LQ and HQ images. As a result, the encoding of LQ inputs may be insufficient, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel dual-branch framework named DAEFR. Our method introduces an auxiliary LQ branch that extracts crucial information from the LQ inputs. Additionally, we incorporate association training to promote effective synergy between the two branches, enhancing code prediction and output quality. We evaluate the effectiveness of DAEFR on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in restoring facial details.},

However, this progress has raised several concerns of potential misuse, particularly in creating copyrighted, prohibited, and restricted content, or NSFW (not safe for work) images. While efforts have been made to mitigate such problems, either by implementing a safety filter at the evaluation stage or by fine-tuning models to eliminate undesirable concepts or styles, the effectiveness of these safety measures in dealing with a wide range of prompts remains largely unexplored. In this work, the authors aim to investigate these safety mechanisms by proposing one novel concept retrieval algorithm for evaluation. They introduce Ring-A-Bell, a model-agnostic red-teaming tool for T2I diffusion models, where the whole evaluation can be prepared in advance without prior knowledge of the target model. Specifically, Ring-A-Bell first performs concept extraction to obtain holistic representations for sensitive and inappropriate concepts. Subsequently, by leveraging the extracted concept, Ring-A-Bell automatically identifies problematic prompts for diffusion models with the corresponding generation of inappropriate content, allowing the user to assess the reliability of deployed safety mechanisms. Finally, they empirically validate their method by testing online services such as Midjourney and various methods of concept removal. Their results show that Ring-A-Bell, by manipulating safe prompting benchmarks, can transform prompts that were originally regarded as safe to evade existing safety mechanisms, thus revealing the defects of the so-called safety mechanisms which could practically lead to the generation of harmful contents.},

To bridge this gap, we propose AutoVP, an end-to-end expandable framework for automating VP design choices, along with 12 downstream image-classification tasks that can serve as a holistic VP-performance benchmark. Our design space covers 1) the joint optimization of the prompts, 2) the selection of pre-trained models, including image classifiers and text-image encoders, and 3) model output mapping strategies, including nonparametric and trainable label mapping. Our extensive experimental results show that AutoVP outperforms the best-known current VP methods by a substantial margin, having up to 6.7% improvement in accuracy; and attains a maximum performance increase of 27.5% compared to linear-probing (LP) baseline. AutoVP thus makes a two-fold contribution: serving both as an efficient tool for hyperparameter tuning on VP design choices, and as a comprehensive benchmark that can reasonably be expected to accelerate VP's development.},

  abstract = {Molecular conformation optimization is crucial to computer-aided drug discovery and materials design. Traditional energy minimization techniques rely on iterative optimization methods that use molecular forces calculated by a physical simulator (oracle) as anti-gradients. However, this is a computationally expensive approach that requires many interactions with a physical simulator. One way to accelerate this procedure is to replace the physical simulator with a neural network. Despite recent progress in neural networks for molecular conformation energy prediction, such models are prone to distribution shift, leading to inaccurate energy minimization. We find that the quality of energy minimization with neural networks can be improved by providing optimization trajectories as additional training data. Still, it takes around $5 \times 10^5$ additional conformations to match the physical simulator's optimization quality. In this work, we present the Gradual Optimization Learning Framework (GOLF) for energy minimization with neural networks that significantly reduces the required additional data. The framework consists of an efficient data-collecting scheme and an external optimizer. The external optimizer utilizes gradients from the energy prediction model to generate optimization trajectories, and the data-collecting scheme selects additional training data to be processed by the physical simulator. Our results demonstrate that the neural network trained with GOLF performs on par with the oracle on a benchmark of diverse drug-like molecules using $50$x less additional data.},

  abstract = {Neural operators, such as Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), form a principled approach for learning solution operators for PDEs and other mappings between function spaces. However, many real-world problems require high-resolution training data, and the training time and limited GPU memory pose big barriers. One solution is to train neural operators in mixed precision to reduce the memory requirement and increase training speed. However, existing mixed-precision training techniques are designed for standard neural networks, and we find that their direct application to FNO leads to numerical overflow and poor memory efficiency. Further, at first glance, it may appear that mixed precision in FNO will lead to drastic accuracy degradation since reducing the precision of the Fourier transform yields poor results in classical numerical solvers. We show that this is not the case; in fact, we prove that reducing the precision in FNO still guarantees a good approximation bound, when done in a targeted manner. Specifically, we build on the intuition that neural operator learning inherently induces an approximation error, arising from discretizing the infinite-dimensional ground-truth input function, implying that training in full precision is not needed. We formalize this intuition by rigorously characterizing the approximation and precision errors of FNO and bounding these errors for general input functions. We prove that the precision error is asymptotically comparable to the approximation error. Based on this, we design a simple method to optimize the memory-intensive half-precision tensor contractions by greedily finding the optimal contraction order. Through extensive experiments on different state-of-the-art neural operators, datasets, and GPUs, we demonstrate that our approach reduces GPU memory usage by up to 50% and improves throughput by 58% with little or no reduction in accuracy.},

Robustness is particularly important in these settings as agents are often fit offline on expert demonstrations but deployed online where they must generalize to the closed feedback loop within the environment. In this work, we explore the application of recurrent neural networks to tasks of this nature and understand how a parameterization of their recurrent connectivity influences robustness in closed-loop settings. Specifically, we represent the recurrent connectivity as a function of rank and sparsity and show both theoretically and empirically that modulating these two variables has desirable effects on network dynamics. The proposed low-rank, sparse connectivity induces an interpretable prior on the network that proves to be most amenable for a class of models known as closed-form continuous-time neural networks (CfCs). We find that CfCs with fewer parameters can outperform their full-rank, fully-connected counterparts in the online setting under distribution shift. This yields memory-efficient and robust agents while opening a new perspective on how we can modulate network dynamics through connectivity.},

We develop two datasets consisting of animal images altered across a diverse set of 27 visual data-types, spanning four broad categories. An extensive zero-shot evaluation of 39 VLMs, ranging from 100M to 80B parameters, shows a nuanced performance landscape. VLMs are reasonably good at identifying stylistic data-types like cartoons and sketches but struggle with simpler data-types arising from basic manipulations like image rotations or additive noise. Scaling model size yields marginal gains for contrastively-trained models, while the largest auto-regressively trained VLMs (e.g., GPT-4V) show a performance drop.

Specifically, we address the properties of word lengths and segmentation, known as Zipf's law of abbreviation (ZLA) and Harris's articulation scheme (HAS), respectively. It has been reported that the emergent languages do not follow them when using the conventional objective. We experimentally demonstrate that by selecting an appropriate prior distribution, more natural segments emerge, while suggesting that the conventional one prevents the languages from following ZLA and HAS.},

  abstract = {Randomized smoothing-based certification is an effective approach for obtaining robustness certificates of deep neural networks (DNNs) against adversarial attacks. This method constructs a smoothed DNN model and certifies its robustness through statistical sampling, but it is computationally expensive, especially when certifying with a large number of samples. Furthermore, when the smoothed model is modified (e.g., quantized or pruned), certification guarantees may not hold for the modified DNN, and recertifying from scratch can be prohibitively expensive. We present the first approach for incremental robustness certification for randomized smoothing, IRS. We show how to reuse the certification guarantees for the original smoothed model to certify an approximated model with very few samples. IRS significantly reduces the computational cost of certifying modified DNNs while maintaining strong robustness guarantees. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing up to 3x certification speedup over the certification that applies randomized smoothing of the approximate model from scratch.},

@inproceedings{um2024dont,
  abstract = {We explore the problem of generating minority samples using diffusion models. The minority samples are instances that lie on low-density regions of a data manifold. Generating a sufficient number of such minority instances is important, since they often contain some unique attributes of the data. However, the conventional generation process of diffusion models mostly yields majority samples (that lie on high-density regions of the manifold) due to their high likelihoods, making themselves ineffective and time-consuming for the minority generating task. In this work, we present a novel framework that can make the generation process of the diffusion models focus on the minority samples. We first highlight that Tweedie's denoising formula yields favorable results for majority samples. The observation motivates us to introduce a metric that describes the uniqueness of a given sample. To address the inherent preference of the diffusion models w.r.t. the majority samples, we further develop minority guidance, a sampling technique that can guide the generation process toward regions with desired likelihood levels. Experiments on benchmark real datasets demonstrate that our minority guidance can greatly improve the capability of generating high-quality minority samples over existing generative samplers. We showcase that the performance benefit of our framework persists even in demanding real-world scenarios such as medical imaging, further underscoring the practical significance of our work.},

In this game, the first player chooses a representation, and then the second player adversarially chooses a prediction task from a given class, representing the prior knowledge. The first player aims to minimize, and the second player to maximize, the regret: The minimal prediction loss using the representation, compared to the same loss using the original features. We consider the canonical setting in which the representation, the response to predict and the predictors are all linear functions, and the loss function is the mean squared error. We derive the theoretically optimal representation in pure strategies, which shows the effectiveness of the prior knowledge, and the optimal regret in mixed strategies, which shows the usefulness of randomizing the representation. We further analyze two important cases: The agnostic case, where the class of tasks consists of all possible prediction tasks, and the isotropic case, where the covariance matrix of the feature vector is the identity matrix.},

Such a process can be modeled by a function coined perceptual scale. The perceptual scale can be deduced from psychophysical measurements that consist in comparing the relative differences between stimuli (i.e. difference scaling experiments). However, this approach is often overlooked by the modeling and experimentation communities. In this work, we demonstrate the value of measuring the perceptual scale of classical (spatial frequency, orientation) and less classical physical variables (interpolation between textures) by embedding it in recent probabilistic modeling of perception. We show that the assumption that an observer has an internal representation of univariate parameters such as spatial frequency or orientation, while stimuli are high-dimensional, does not lead to contradictory predictions when following the theoretical framework. We show that it is related to the Fisher information of the generative model that underlies perception and we test the predictions given by the generative model of different stimuli in a set of difference scaling experiments. Our main conclusion is that the perceptual scale is mostly driven by the stimulus power spectrum.},

@inproceedings{vaduguru2024generating,
  abstract = {Programming-by-example is the task of synthesizing a program that is consistent with a set of user-provided input-output examples. As examples are often an under-specification of one's intent, a good synthesizer must choose the intended program from the many that are consistent with the given set of examples. Prior work frames program synthesis as a cooperative game between a listener (that synthesizes programs) and a speaker (a user choosing examples), and shows that models of computational pragmatic inference are effective in choosing the user intended programs. However, these models require counterfactual reasoning over a large set of programs and examples, which is infeasible in realistic program spaces. In this paper, we propose PraX, a novel way to amortize this search with neural networks. We sample pairs of programs and examples via self-play between listener and speaker models, and use pragmatic inference to choose informative training examples from this sample. We then use the informative dataset to train models to improve the synthesizer's ability to disambiguate user-provided examples without human supervision. We validate PraX on the challenging task of synthesizing regular expressions from example strings, and find that our method (1) outperforms models trained without choosing pragmatic examples by 23% (a 51% relative increase) (2) matches the performance of supervised learning on a dataset of pragmatic examples provided by humans, despite using no human data in training.},

Current approaches to PbRL do not address the credit assignment problem inherent in determining which parts of a behavior most contributed to a preference resulting in data intensive approaches and subpar reward models. We address such limitations by introducing a credit assignment strategy (Hindsight PRIOR) that uses a world model to approximate state importance within a trajectory and then guides rewards to be proportional to state importance through an auxiliary predicted return redistribution objective. Incorporating state importance into reward learning improves the speed of policy learning, overall policy performance, and reward recovery on both locomotion and manipulation tasks. For example, Hindsight PRIOR recovers on average significantly (p<0.05) more reward on MetaWorld (20\%) and DMC (15\%). The performance gains and our ablations demonstrate the benefits even a simple credit assignment strategy can have on reward learning and that state importance in forward dynamics prediction is a strong proxy for a state's contribution to a preference decision.},

Due to the statistical heterogeneities between sessions and animals, a new model is trained from scratch to infer the underlying dynamics for each new dataset. This is computationally expensive and does not fully leverage all the available data. Moreover, as these models get more complex, they can be challenging to train. In parallel, it is becoming common to use pre-trained models in the machine learning community for few shot and transfer learning. One major hurdle that prevents the re-use of generative models in neuroscience is the complex spatio-temporal structure of neural dynamics within and across animals. Interestingly, the underlying dynamics identified from different datasets on the same task are qualitatively similar. In this work, we exploit this observation and propose a source-free and unsupervised alignment approach that utilizes the learnt dynamics and enables the re-use of trained generative models.

In particular, we propose the HyperCombinator (HC), a piecewise-linear neural architecture expressing a policy with a controllably small number of sub-policies.

Alternatively, a cost-effective and compelling approach is to merge existing pre-trained LLMs into a more potent model. However, due to the varying architectures of these LLMs, directly blending their weights is impractical. In this paper, we introduce the notion of knowledge fusion for LLMs, aimed at combining the capabilities of existing LLMs and transferring them into a single LLM. By leveraging the generative distributions of source LLMs, we externalize their collective knowledge and unique strengths, thereby potentially elevating the capabilities of the target model beyond those of any individual source LLM. We validate our approach using three popular LLMs with different architectures--Llama-2, MPT, and OpenLLaMA--across various benchmarks and tasks.},

SparseDFF generates view-consistent 3D DFFs, enabling efficient one-shot learning of dexterous manipulations by mapping image features to a 3D point cloud. Central to SparseDFF is a feature refinement network, optimized with a contrastive loss between views and a point-pruning mechanism for feature continuity. The method addresses the challenge of transferring manipulation abilities across objects of varying shapes, poses, and appearances, a capability rooted in their understanding of semantic correspondences between different instances. Validated in real-world scenarios with a dexterous hand, SparseDFF proves effective in manipulating both rigid and deformable objects, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities across object and scene variations.},

However, existing processing frameworks prioritize the generation of stimulation while disregarding the potential impact of restoration effects and fail to assess the quality of the generated stimulation properly. To address this challenge, we introduce an end-to-end visual prosthesis framework (StimuSEE) that generates stimulation patterns with proper quality verification using V1 neuron spike patterns as supervision. The framework employs a vision system modeling that simulates the signal processing from the retina to the primary visual cortex (V1) and assesses the quality of generated stimulation patterns by comparing the elicited V1 responses with those of natural vision.},

  abstract = {Lipschitz constant estimation plays an important role in understanding generalization, robustness, and fairness in deep learning. Unlike naive bounds based on the network weight norm product, semidefinite programs (SDPs) have shown great promise in providing less conservative Lipschitz bounds with polynomial-time complexity guarantees. However, due to the memory consumption and running speed, standard SDP algorithms cannot scale to modern neural network architectures. We transform the SDPs for Lipschitz constant estimation into an eigenvalue optimization problem, which aligns with the modern large-scale optimization paradigms based on first-order methods. This is amenable to autodiff frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, requiring significantly less memory than standard SDP algorithms. The essential technique of our eigenvalue-problem transformation is to introduce redundant quadratic constraints and then utilize both Lagrangian and Shor's SDP relaxations under a certain trace constraint. Our numerical study successfully scales the SDP-based Lipschitz constant estimation to address large neural networks on ImageNet.},

@inproceedings{wang2024accelerating,
  abstract = {Learning neural operators for solving partial differential equations ({PDEs}) has attracted great attention due to its high inference efficiency. However, training such operators requires generating a substantial amount of labeled data, i.e., {PDE} problems together with their solutions. The data generation process is exceptionally time-consuming, as it involves solving numerous systems of linear equations to obtain numerical solutions to the {PDEs}. Many existing methods solve these systems independently without considering their inherent similarities, resulting in extremely redundant computations. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel method, namely Sorting {Krylov} Recycling ({SKR}), to boost the efficiency of solving these systems, thus significantly accelerating data generation for neural operators training. To the best of our knowledge, {SKR} is the first attempt to address the time-consuming nature of data generation for learning neural operators. The working horse of {SKR} is {Krylov} subspace recycling, a powerful technique for solving a series of interrelated systems by leveraging their inherent similarities. Specifically, {SKR} employs a sorting algorithm to arrange these systems in a sequence, where adjacent systems exhibit high similarities. Then it equips a solver with {Krylov} subspace recycling to solve the systems sequentially instead of independently, thus effectively enhancing the solving efficiency. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that {SKR} can significantly accelerate neural operator data generation, achieving a remarkable speedup of up to 13.9 times.},

  abstract = {Theoretical and empirical comparisons have been made to assess the expressive power and performance of invariant and equivariant {GNNs}. However, there is currently no theoretical result comparing the expressive power of $k$-hop invariant {GNNs} and equivariant {GNNs}. Additionally, little is understood about whether the performance of equivariant {GNNs}, employing steerable features up to type-$L$, increases as $L$ grows -- especially when the feature dimension is held constant. In this study, we introduce a key lemma that allows us to analyze steerable features by examining their corresponding invariant features. The lemma facilitates us in understanding the limitations of $k$-hop invariant {GNNs}, which fail to capture the global geometric structure due to the loss of geometric information between local structures. Furthermore, we investigate the invariant features associated with different types of steerable features and demonstrate that the expressiveness of steerable features is primarily determined by their dimension -- independent of their irreducible decomposition. This suggests that when the feature dimension is constant, increasing $L$ does not lead to essentially improved performance in equivariant {GNNs} employing steerable features up to type-$L$. We substantiate our theoretical insights with numerical evidence.},

@inproceedings{wang2024neuroback,
  abstract = {Propositional satisfiability ({SAT}) is an {NP}-complete problem that impacts many research fields, such as planning, verification, and security. Mainstream modern {SAT} solvers are based on the Conflict-Driven Clause Learning ({CDCL}) algorithm. Recent work aimed to enhance {CDCL} {SAT} solvers using Graph Neural Networks ({GNNs}). However, so far this approach either has not made solving more effective, or required substantial {GPU} resources for frequent online model inferences. Aiming to make {GNN} improvements practical, this paper proposes an approach called {NeuroBack}, which builds on two insights: (1) predicting phases (i.e., values) of variables appearing in the majority (or even all) of the satisfying assignments are essential for {CDCL} {SAT} solving, and (2) it is sufficient to query the neural model only once for the predictions before the {SAT} solving starts. Once trained, the offline model inference allows {NeuroBack} to execute exclusively on the {CPU}, removing its reliance on {GPU} resources. To train {NeuroBack}, a new dataset called {DataBack} containing 120,286 data samples is created. Finally, {NeuroBack} is implemented as an enhancement to a state-of-the-art {SAT} solver called {Kissat}. As a result, it allowed {Kissat} to solve 5.2\% more problems on the recent {SAT} competition problem set, {SATCOMP-2022}. {NeuroBack} therefore shows how machine learning can be harnessed to improve {SAT} solving in an effective and practical manner.},

In tasks such as matrix completion, the goal is to converge to the local minimum with the smallest rank that still fits the training data. While rank-underestimating minima can be avoided since they do not fit the data, {GD} might get stuck at rank-overestimating minima. We show that with {SGD}, there is always a probability to jump from a higher rank minimum to a lower rank one, but the probability of jumping back is zero. More precisely, we define a sequence of sets $B_1 \subset B_2 \subset \cdots \subset B_R$ so that $B_r$ contains all minima of rank $r$ or less (and not more) that are absorbing for small enough ridge parameters $\lambda$ and learning rates $\eta$: {SGD} has prob. 0 of leaving $B_r$, and from any starting point there is a non-zero prob. for {SGD} to go in $B_r$.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the implications of using graphs instead of hypergraphs to represent real-world interconnected systems whose relationships are naturally higher-order. Such modeling involves a projection process mapping hypergraphs to graphs, which is common in graph-based analysis. While hypergraph projection can lead to loss of higher-order relations, there are limited studies on the consequences and remediation. The work addresses this gap through two contributions: (1) developing analysis based on graph and set theory to show two patterns of hyperedges that cause structural information loss in projections, and quantifying the combinatorial impossibility of recovery without extra help; (2) developing a learning-based hypergraph reconstruction method using hyperedge distribution statistics, with reasonable assumptions allowing domain knowledge assistance. The reconstruction method is evaluated on 8 real-world datasets and demonstrates consistently top performance, with benefits shown through protein rankings and link prediction use cases.},

  abstract = {Self-supervised learning ({SSL}) has recently received significant attention due to its ability to train high-performance encoders purely on unlabeled data---often scraped from the internet. This data can still be sensitive and empirical evidence suggests that {SSL} encoders memorize private information of their training data and can disclose them at inference time. Since existing theoretical definitions of memorization from supervised learning rely on labels, they do not transfer to {SSL}. To address this gap, we propose {SSLMem}, a framework for defining memorization within {SSL}. Our definition compares the difference in alignment of representations for data points and their augmented views returned by both encoders that were trained on these data points and encoders that were not. We show that this memorization is essential for encoders to achieve higher generalization performance on different downstream tasks.},

  abstract = {Gradient inversion attacks aim to reconstruct local training data from intermediate gradients exposed in the federated learning framework. Despite successful attacks, all previous methods, starting from reconstructing a single data point and then relaxing the single-image limit to batch level, are only tested under hard label constraints. Even for single-image reconstruction, we still lack an analysis-based algorithm to recover augmented soft labels. In this work, we change the focus from enlarging batchsize to investigating the hard label constraints, considering a more realistic circumstance where label smoothing and mixup techniques are used in the training process. In particular, we are the first to initiate a novel algorithm to simultaneously recover the ground-truth augmented label and the input feature of the last fully-connected layer from single-input gradients, and provide a necessary condition for any analytical-based label recovery methods. Extensive experiments testify to the label recovery accuracy, as well as the benefits to the following image reconstruction. We believe soft labels in classification tasks are worth further attention in gradient inversion attacks.},

Various methods have been developed to address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, including regularization-based, Bayesian-based, and memory-replay-based techniques. However, these methods lack a unified framework and common terminology for describing their approaches. This research aims to bridge this gap by introducing a comprehensive and overarching framework that encompasses and reconciles these existing methodologies. Notably, this new framework is capable of encompassing established CL approaches as special instances within a unified and general optimization objective. Building upon our unified framework, we derive a new refresh learning mechanism with an unlearn-relearn scheme to more effectively combat the forgetting issue. The proposed method is a simple plug-in and can be seamlessly integrated with existing CL methods. We provide in-depth theoretical analysis to prove the generalization ability of the proposed refresh learning mechanism. Extensive experiments on several representative datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of refresh learning.},

PET has gained popularity, especially in the context of large-scale models, due to its ability to reduce transfer learning costs and conserve hardware resources. However, existing PET approaches primarily focus on recognition tasks and typically support uni-modal optimization, while neglecting dense prediction tasks and vision language interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel PET framework called Bi-directional Intertwined Vision Language Efficient Tuning for Referring Image Segmentation (BarLeRIa), which leverages bi-directional intertwined vision language adapters to fully exploit the frozen pre-trained models' potential. In BarLeRIa, two different tuning modules are employed for efficient attention, one for global, and the other for local, along with an intertwined vision language tuning module for efficient modal fusion. Extensive experiments conducted on RIS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of BarLeRIa over prior PET methods with a significant margin, i.e., achieving an average improvement of 5.6\%. Remarkably, without requiring additional training datasets, BarLeRIa even surpasses SOTA full fine-tuning approaches.},

Recently, neural operators have emerged as a promising technique to solve elliptic PDEs more efficiently by directly mapping the input to solutions. However, existing networks typically cannot handle complex geometries and inhomogeneous boundary values present in the real world. Here we introduce Boundary-Embedded Neural Operators (BENO), a novel neural operator architecture that embeds the complex geometries and inhomogeneous boundary values into the solving of elliptic PDEs. Inspired by classical Green's function, BENO consists of two branches of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for interior source term and boundary values, respectively. Furthermore, a Transformer encoder maps the global boundary geometry into a latent vector which influences each message passing layer of the GNNs. We test our model extensively in elliptic PDEs with various boundary conditions. We show that all existing baseline methods fail to learn the solution operator. In contrast, our model, endowed with boundary-embedded architecture, outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators and strong baselines by an average of 60.96\%.},

In particular, we show that nonlinear sequence relationships that can be stably approximated by nonlinear RNNs must have an exponential decaying memory structure -- a notion that can be made precise.

Recent research has focused on developing efficient fine-tuning methods, such as prompt learning and adapter, to enhance CLIP's performance in downstream tasks. However, these methods still require additional training time and computational resources, which is undesirable for devices with limited resources. In this paper, we revisit a classical algorithm, Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA), and apply it to the downstream classification of CLIP. Typically, GDA assumes that features of each class follow Gaussian distributions with identical covariance. By leveraging Bayes' formula, the classifier can be expressed in terms of the class means and covariance, which can be estimated from the data without the need for training. To integrate knowledge from both visual and textual modalities, we ensemble it with the original zero-shot classifier within CLIP. Extensive results on 17 datasets validate that our method surpasses or achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art methods on few-shot classification, imbalanced learning, and out-of-distribution generalization. In addition, we extend our method to base-to-new generalization and unsupervised learning, once again demonstrating its superiority over competing approaches.},

Existing prompt optimization techniques, though automated through iterative sampling, often fall short in injecting domain knowledge and exploring the vast prompt space for complex expert-level prompts efficiently. To address this pressing need and achieve expert-level prompting, we introduce PromptAgent, which autonomously discovers prompts equivalent in quality to those handcrafted by experts. At its core, PromptAgent views prompt optimization as a strategic planning problem and employs a principled planning algorithm (rooted in Monte Carlo Tree Search) to strategically explore the vast expert-level prompt space. PromptAgent interacts with the LLM in a human-like trial-and-error manner during the planning, and injects expert-level knowledge by reflecting on model errors and generating insightful error feedback. This novel formulation allows it to iteratively evaluate intermediate prompts, refine them based on errors, simulate future rewards, and search for high-reward paths leading to expert-level prompts.},

@inproceedings{wang2024gensim,
  abstract = {Collecting large amounts of real-world interaction data to train general robotic policies is often prohibitively expensive, thus motivating the use of simulation data. However, existing methods for data generation have generally focused on scene-level diversity (e.g., object instances and poses) rather than task-level diversity, due to the human effort required to come up with and verify novel tasks. This has made it challenging for policies trained on simulation data to demonstrate significant task-level generalization. In this paper, we propose to automatically generate rich simulation environments and expert demonstrations by exploiting a large language model's (LLM) grounding and coding ability. Our approach, dubbed GenSim, has two modes: goal-directed generation, wherein a target task is given to the LLM and the LLM proposes a task curriculum to solve the target task, and exploratory generation, wherein the LLM bootstraps from previous tasks and iteratively proposes novel tasks that would be helpful in solving more complex tasks. We show that LLM-generated simulation programs can enhance task-level generalization significantly when used for multitask policy training, and with minimal sim-to-real adaptation, the multitask policies pretrained on GPT4-generated simulation tasks exhibit stronger transfer to unseen long-horizon tasks in the real world and outperform baselines by 25\%.},

In stochastic optimization like neural network training, folklore suggests momentum may help by reducing variance of stochastic gradient updates, but previous theoretical analyses don't find provable acceleration. In this work, we revisit the problem and focus on the small learning rate regime. We first prove that momentum indeed has limited benefits for both optimization and generalization in practical training regimes where optimal learning rate isn't very large, including small- to medium-batch training from scratch on ImageNet and fine-tuning language models on downstream tasks. Our theoretical results clarify momentum's role in stochastic settings where learning rate is small and gradient noise dominates instability, suggesting SGD with and without momentum behave similarly in short and long time horizons. Experiments show momentum indeed has limited benefits for both optimization and generalization in practical training regimes where optimal learning rate isn't very large.},

A cascaded diffusion model is trained to model the hierarchical language, where each level is conditioned on its upper levels.

We specifically consider target functions of the form $h = g \circ p$ where $p : \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a degree $k$ polynomial and $g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a degree $q$ polynomial. This function class generalizes the single-index model, which corresponds to $k=1$, and is a natural class of functions possessing an underlying hierarchical structure. Our main result shows that for a large subclass of degree $k$ polynomials $p$, a three-layer neural network trained via layerwise gradient descent on the square loss learns the target $h$ up to vanishing test error in $\widetilde{O}(d^k)$ samples and polynomial time. This is a strict improvement over kernel methods, which require $\widetilde{\Theta}(d^{kq})$ samples, as well as existing guarantees for two-layer networks, which require the target function to be low-rank. Our result also generalizes prior works on three-layer neural networks, which were restricted to the case of $p$ being a quadratic. When $p$ is indeed a quadratic, we achieve the information-theoretically optimal sample complexity $\widetilde{O}(d^2)$, which is an improvement over prior work requiring a sample size of $\widetilde{\Theta}(d^4)$. Our proof proceeds by showing that during the initial stage of training the network performs feature learning to recover the feature $p$ with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^k)$ samples. This work demonstrates the ability of three-layer neural networks to learn complex features and as a result, learn a broad class of hierarchical functions.},

Recently, there have been extensive research efforts in explaining the decision-making process of {GNN}s. These efforts often focus on explaining why a certain prediction is being made for a particular instance, or what discriminative features the {GNN}s try to detect for each class. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing study on understanding the decision boundaries of {GNN}s. The paper introduces {GNNBoundary} as a novel approach to understanding {GNN} behavior. For an adjacent class pair, the near-boundary graphs between them are effectively generated by optimizing a novel objective function specifically designed for the purpose of boundary graph generation. Thus, by analyzing the near-boundary graphs, the important characteristics of decision boundaries can be uncovered. To evaluate the efficacy of {GNNBoundary}, we conduct experiments on both synthetic datasets and public real-world datasets.

  abstract = {Pretrained large language models ({LLM}s) are general purpose problem solvers applicable to a diverse set of tasks with prompts. They can be further improved towards a specific task by fine-tuning on a specialized dataset. However, fine-tuning usually makes the model narrowly specialized on this dataset with reduced general in-context learning performances, which is undesirable whenever the fine-tuned model needs to handle additional tasks where no fine-tuning data is available. In this work, we first demonstrate that fine-tuning on a single task indeed decreases {LLM}s' general in-context learning performance. We discover one important cause of such forgetting, format specialization, where the model overfits to the format of the fine-tuned task. We further show that format specialization happens at the very beginning of fine-tuning. To solve this problem, we propose Prompt Tuning with {MO}del Tuning ({ProMoT}), a simple yet effective two-stage fine-tuning framework that reduces format specialization and improves generalization. {ProMoT} offloads task-specific format learning into additional and removable parameters by first doing prompt tuning and then fine-tuning the model itself with this soft prompt attached. With experiments on several fine-tuning tasks and 8 in-context evaluation tasks, we show that {ProMoT} achieves comparable performance on fine-tuned tasks to standard fine-tuning, but with much less loss of in-context learning performances across a board range of out-of-domain evaluation tasks.},

  abstract = {Scaling of deep neural networks, especially Transformers, is pivotal for their surging performance and has further led to the emergence of sophisticated reasoning capabilities in foundation models. Such scaling generally requires training large models from scratch with random initialization, failing to leverage the knowledge acquired by their smaller counterparts, which are already resource-intensive to obtain. To tackle this inefficiency, we present Lossless Model Expansion ({LEMON}), a recipe to initialize scaled models using the weights of their smaller but pre-trained counterparts. This is followed by model training with an optimized learning rate scheduler tailored explicitly for the scaled models, substantially reducing the training time compared to training from scratch. Notably, {LEMON} is versatile, ensuring compatibility with various network structures, including models like Vision Transformers and {BERT}. Our empirical results demonstrate that {LEMON} reduces computational costs by 56.7\% for Vision Transformers and 33.2\% for {BERT} when compared to training from scratch.},

  abstract = {Generalized Category Discovery ({GCD}) aims to classify unlabelled images from both 'seen' and 'unseen' classes by transferring knowledge from a set of labelled 'seen' class images. A key theme in existing {GCD} approaches is adapting large-scale pre-trained models for the {GCD} task. An alternate perspective, however, is to adapt the data representation itself for better alignment with the pre-trained model. As such, in this paper, we introduce a two-stage adaptation approach termed {SPTNet}, which iteratively optimizes model parameters (i.e., model-finetuning) and data parameters (i.e., prompt learning). Furthermore, we propose a novel spatial prompt tuning method ({SPT}) which considers the spatial property of image data, enabling the method to better focus on object parts, which can transfer between seen and unseen classes. We thoroughly evaluate our {SPTNet} on standard benchmarks and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing {GCD} methods. Notably, we find our method achieves an average accuracy of 61.4\% on the {SSB}, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by approximately 10\%. The improvement is particularly remarkable as our method yields extra parameters amounting to only 0.117\% of those in the backbone architecture.},

@inproceedings{wang2024rotation,
  abstract = {One-class classification ({OCC}) involves predicting whether a new data is normal or anomalous based solely on the data from a single class during training. Various attempts have been made to learn suitable representations for {OCC} within a self-supervised framework. Notably, discriminative methods that use geometric visual transformations, such as rotation, to generate pseudo-anomaly samples have exhibited impressive detection performance. Although rotation is commonly viewed as a distribution-shifting transformation and is widely used in the literature, the cause of its effectiveness has not been thoroughly investigated. The root cause of this phenomenon can be attributed to the transformation bias in the dataset, where representations learned from transformations already present in the dataset tend to be less effective, making it essential to accurately estimate the transformation distribution before utilizing pretext tasks involving these transformations for reliable self-supervised representation learning. To this end, we propose a novel two-stage method to estimate the transformation distribution within the dataset. In the first stage, we learn general representations through standard contrastive pre-training. In the second stage, we select potentially semantics-preserving samples from the entire augmented dataset, which includes all rotations, by employing density matching with the provided reference distribution. By sorting samples based on semantics-preserving versus shifting transformations, we achieve improved performance on {OCC} benchmarks.},

A natural question to ask is whether this performance gain can only be achieved with language pre-training, or can be achieved with simpler pre-training schemes which do not involve language. In this paper, we first show that language is not essential for improved performance, and indeed pre-training with synthetic {IID} data for a small number of updates can match the performance gains from pre-training with a large language corpus; moreover, pre-training with data generated by a one-step Markov chain can further improve the performance. Inspired by these experimental results, we then consider pre-training Conservative Q-Learning ({CQL}), a popular offline {DRL} algorithm, which is Q-learning-based and typically employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron ({MLP}) backbone. We show that synthetic data pre-training can significantly improve the performance of {CQL} on several offline {RL} benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that synthetic data can be a simple yet effective alternative to language-based pre-training for offline reinforcement learning.},

Adequate high-quality data, coupled with deep models capable of inference, are both indispensible and prerequisite for achieving meaningful results. However, the sparsity of data and the high costs associated with deploying sensors lead to significant data imbalances. Models that are overly tailored and lack causal relationships further compromise the generalizabilities of inference methods. Towards this end, we first establish a causal concept for {ST} predictions, named {NuwaDynamics}, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Concretely, we initially leverage upstream self-supervision to discern causal important patches, imbuing the model with generalized information and conducting informed interventions on complementary trivial patches to extrapolate potential test distributions. This phase is referred to as the discovery step. Advancing beyond discovery step, we transfer the data to downstream tasks for targeted {ST} objectives, aiding the model in recognizing a broader potential distribution and fostering its causal perceptual capabilities (refer as Update step). Our concept aligns seamlessly with the contemporary backdoor adjustment mechanism in causality theory. {NuwaDynamics} also can significantly benefit a wide range of changeable {ST} tasks like extreme weather and long temporal step super-resolution predictions.},

Whereas prior works have focused on leveraging {LLMs} directly for planning in symbolic spaces, this work uses {LLMs} to guide the search of task structures and constraints implicit in multi-step demonstrations. By replaying a few human demonstrations with synthetic perturbations, we generate coverage over the demonstrations' state space with additional successful executions as well as counterfactuals that fail the task. Our explanation-based learning framework trains an end-to-end differentiable neural network to predict successful trajectories from failures and as a by-product learns classifiers that ground low-level states and images in mode families without dense labeling. The learned grounding classifiers can further be used to translate language plans into reactive policies in the physical domain in an interpretable manner. We show our approach improves the interpretability and reactivity of imitation learning through {2D} navigation and simulated and real robot manipulation tasks. The paper specifically borrows from manipulation planning literature the concept of mode families, which group robot configurations by specific motion constraints, to serve as an abstraction layer between the high-level language representations of an {LLM} and the low-level physical trajectories of a robot.},

  abstract = {Time series forecasting is widely used in extensive applications, such as traffic planning and weather forecasting. However, real-world time series usually present intricate temporal variations, making forecasting extremely challenging. Going beyond the mainstream paradigms of plain decomposition and multiperiodicity analysis, we analyze temporal variations in a novel view of multiscale-mixing, where time series present distinct patterns in different sampling scales. Specifically, the microscopic and the macroscopic information are reflected in fine and coarse scales, respectively, and thereby complex variations are inherently disentangled. Based on this observation, we propose {TimeMixer} as a fully {MLP}-based architecture with Past-Decomposable-Mixing ({PDM}) and Future-Multipredictor-Mixing ({FMM}) blocks to take full advantage of disentangled multiscale series in both past extraction and future prediction phases. Concretely, {PDM} applies the decomposition to multiscale series and further mixes the decomposed seasonal and trend components in fine-to-coarse and coarse-to-fine directions separately, which successively aggregates the microscopic seasonal and macroscopic trend information. {FMM} further ensembles multiple predictors to utilize complementary forecasting capabilities in multiscale observations. Consequently, our proposed {TimeMixer} is able to achieve consistent state-of-the-art performances in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with favorable run-time efficiency.},

@inproceedings{wang2024kill,
  abstract = {Real-world tasks are universally associated with training samples that exhibit a long-tailed class distribution, and traditional deep learning models are not suitable for fitting this distribution, thus resulting in a biased trained model. To surmount this dilemma, massive deep long-tailed learning studies have been proposed to achieve inter-class fairness models by designing sophisticated sampling strategies or improving existing model structures and loss functions. Habitually, these studies tend to apply data augmentation strategies to improve the generalization performance of their models. However, this augmentation strategy applied to balanced distributions may not be the best option for long-tailed distributions. For a profound understanding of data augmentation, we first theoretically analyze the gains of traditional augmentation strategies in long-tailed learning, and observe that augmentation methods cause the long-tailed distribution to be imbalanced again, resulting in an intertwined imbalance: inherent data-wise imbalance and extrinsic augmentation-wise imbalance, i.e., two 'birds' co-exist in long-tailed learning. Motivated by this observation, we propose an adaptive Dynamic Optional Data Augmentation ({DODA}) to address this intertwined imbalance, i.e., one 'stone' simultaneously 'kills' two 'birds', which allows each class to choose appropriate augmentation methods by maintaining a corresponding augmentation probability distribution for each class during training. Extensive experiments across mainstream long-tailed recognition benchmarks (e.g., {CIFAR}-100-{LT}, {ImageNet}-{LT}, and i{Naturalist} 2018) prove the effectiveness and flexibility of the {DODA} in overcoming the intertwined imbalance.},

  abstract = {In Federated Learning ({FL}), model aggregation is pivotal. It involves a global server iteratively aggregating client local trained models in successive rounds without accessing private data. Traditional methods typically aggregate the local models from the current round alone. However, due to the statistical heterogeneity across clients, the local models from different clients may be greatly diverse, making the obtained global model incapable of maintaining the specific knowledge of each local model. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, {FedCDA}, which selectively aggregates cross-round local models, decreasing discrepancies between the global model and local models. Specifically, {FedCDA} maintains a model pool that stores local models from previous rounds and selects models from this pool based on their divergence from the current global model. The selected models are then aggregated with the current round's models to update the global model. This approach enables the global model to better retain knowledge from diverse clients across different rounds, leading to improved performance and convergence. Extensive experiments on various datasets and settings demonstrate the effectiveness of {FedCDA} compared to existing federated learning methods.},

Text watermarking techniques have proven reliable in distinguishing whether a text is generated by {LLMs} by injecting hidden patterns. However, we argue that existing {LLM} watermarking methods are encoding-inefficient and cannot flexibly meet the diverse information encoding needs (such as encoding model version, generation time, user id, etc.). In this work, we conduct the first systematic study on the topic of Codable Text Watermarking for {LLMs} ({CTWL}) that allows text watermarks to carry multi-bit customizable information. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation system for {CTWL}: (1) watermarking success rate, (2) robustness against various corruptions, (3) coding rate of payload information, (4) encoding and decoding efficiency, (5) impacts on the quality of the generated text. To meet the requirements of these non-Pareto-improving metrics, we follow the most prominent vocabulary partition-based watermarking direction, and devise an advanced {CTWL} method named Balance-Marking. The core idea of our method is to use a proxy language model to split the vocabulary into probability-balanced parts, thereby effectively maintaining the quality of the watermarked text.},

Existing PSIS methods usually rely on positional information to distinguish objects, but predicting precise boundaries remains challenging due to the lack of contour annotations. Nevertheless, weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods are proficient in utilizing intra-class feature consistency to capture the boundary contours of the same semantic regions. In this paper, we design a Mutual Distillation Module (MDM) to leverage the complementary strengths of both instance position and semantic information and achieve accurate instance-level object perception. The MDM consists of Semantic to Instance (S2I) and Instance to Semantic (I2S). S2I is guided by the precise boundaries of semantic regions to learn the association between annotated points and instance contours. I2S leverages discriminative relationships between instances to facilitate the differentiation of various objects within the semantic map. Extensive experiments substantiate the efficacy of MDM in fostering the synergy between instance and semantic information, consequently improving the quality of instance-level object representations.

To determine the optimal hyperparameters, an automatic, robust, and reliable evaluation benchmark is essential. However, establishing such a benchmark is not a trivial task due to the challenges associated with evaluation accuracy and privacy protection. In response to these challenges, we introduce a judge large language model, named PandaLM, which is trained to distinguish the superior model given several LLMs. PandaLM's focus extends beyond just the objective correctness of responses, which is the main focus of traditional evaluation datasets. It addresses vital subjective factors such as relative conciseness, clarity, adherence to instructions, comprehensiveness, and formality. To ensure the reliability of PandaLM, we collect a diverse human-annotated test dataset, where all contexts are generated by humans and labels are aligned with human preferences. Our results indicate that PandaLM-7B achieves 93.75\% of GPT-3.5's evaluation ability and 88.28\% of GPT-4's in terms of F1-score on our test dataset. Our findings reveal that PandaLM-7B offers a performance comparable to both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Impressively, PandaLM-70B surpasses their performance. PandaLM enables the evaluation of LLM to be fairer but with less cost, evidenced by significant improvements achieved by models tuned through PandaLM compared to their counterparts trained with default Alpaca's hyperparameters. In addition, PandaLM does not depend on API-based evaluations, thus avoiding potential data leakage.},

First, we introduce MPNN-then-SF, an innovative architecture leveraging structural feature (SF) to guide MPNN's representation pooling, with its implementation, namely Neural Common Neighbor (NCN). NCN exhibits superior expressiveness and scalability compared with existing models, which can be classified into two categories: SF-then-MPNN, augmenting MPNN's input with SF, and SF-and-MPNN, decoupling SF and MPNN. Second, we investigate the impact of graph incompleteness -- the phenomenon that some links are unobserved in the input graph -- on SF, like the common neighbor. Through dataset visualization, we observe that incompleteness reduces common neighbors and induces distribution shifts, significantly affecting model performance. To address this issue, we propose to use a link prediction model to complete the common neighbor structure.},

@inproceedings{2024generated,
  abstract = {Contrastive Learning (CL) has emerged as one of the most successful paradigms for unsupervised visual representation learning, yet it often depends on intensive manual data augmentations. With the rise of generative models, especially diffusion models, the ability to generate realistic images close to the real data distribution has been well recognized. These generated high-equality images have been successfully applied to enhance contrastive representation learning, a technique termed ``data inflation''. However, we find that the generated data (even from a good diffusion model like DDPM) may sometimes even harm contrastive learning. We investigate the causes behind this failure from the perspective of both data inflation and data augmentation. For the first time, we reveal the complementary roles that stronger data inflation should be accompanied by weaker augmentations, and vice versa. We also provide rigorous theoretical explanations for these phenomena via deriving its generalization bounds under data inflation. Drawing from these insights, we propose Adaptive Inflation (AdaInf), a purely data-centric strategy without introducing any extra computation cost. On benchmark datasets, AdaInf can bring significant improvements for various contrastive learning methods. Notably, without using external data, AdaInf obtains 94.70\% linear accuracy on CIFAR-10 with SimCLR, setting a new record that surpasses many sophisticated methods.},

@inproceedings{2024nonnegative,
  abstract = {Deep representations have shown promising performance when transferred to downstream tasks in a black-box manner. Yet, their inherent lack of interpretability remains a significant challenge, as these features are often opaque to human understanding. In this paper, we propose Non-negative Contrastive Learning (NCL), a renaissance of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) aimed at deriving interpretable features. The power of NCL lies in its enforcement of non-negativity constraints on features, reminiscent of NMF's capability to extract features that align closely with sample clusters. NCL not only aligns mathematically well with an NMF objective but also preserves NMF's interpretability attributes, resulting in a more sparse and disentangled representation compared to standard contrastive learning (CL). Theoretically, we establish guarantees on the identifiability and downstream generalization of NCL. Empirically, we show that these advantages enable NCL to outperform CL significantly on feature disentanglement, feature selection, as well as downstream classification tasks. At last, we show that NCL can be easily extended to other learning scenarios and benefit supervised learning as well.},

The two fields are intertwined and should share a common programming framework to facilitate each other's development. However, none of the existing software in the fields can achieve this goal, because traditional brain simulators lack differentiability for training, while existing deep learning (DL) frameworks fail to capture the biophysical realism and complexity of brain dynamics. In this paper, we introduce BrainPy, a differentiable brain simulator developed using JAX and XLA, with the aim of bridging the gap between brain simulation and BIC. BrainPy expands upon the functionalities of JAX, a powerful AI framework, by introducing complete capabilities for flexible, efficient, and scalable brain simulation. It offers a range of sparse and event-driven operators for efficient and scalable brain simulation, an abstraction for managing the intricacies of synaptic computations, a modular and flexible interface for constructing multi-scale brain models, and an object-oriented just-in-time compilation approach to handle the memory-intensive nature of brain dynamics. We showcase the efficiency and scalability of BrainPy on benchmark tasks, highlight its differentiable simulation for biologically plausible spiking models, and discuss its potential to support research at the intersection of brain simulation and BIC.},

Compared with the base optimizer (e.g., Adam), SAM doubles the time overhead due to the additional perturbation gradient.

@inproceedings{wang2024hypothesis,
  abstract = {Inductive reasoning is a core problem-solving capacity: humans can identify underlying principles from a few examples, which robustly generalize to novel scenarios. Recent work evaluates large language models (LLMs) on inductive reasoning tasks by directly prompting them yielding ``in context learning.'' This works well for straightforward inductive tasks but performs poorly on complex tasks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this work, we propose to improve the inductive reasoning ability of LLMs by generating explicit hypotheses at multiple levels of abstraction: we prompt the LLM to propose multiple abstract hypotheses about the problem, in natural language, then implement the natural language hypotheses as concrete Python programs. These programs can be directly verified by running on the observed examples and generalized to novel inputs. To reduce the hypothesis search space, we explore steps to filter the set of hypotheses to implement: we either ask the LLM to summarize them into a smaller set of hypotheses or ask human annotators to select a subset. We verify our pipeline's effectiveness on the ARC visual inductive reasoning benchmark, its variant 1D-ARC, string transformation dataset SyGuS, and list transformation dataset List Functions. On a random 100-problem subset of ARC, our automated pipeline using LLM summaries achieves 30\% accuracy, outperforming the direct prompting baseline (accuracy of 17\%). With the minimal human input of selecting from LLM-generated candidates, performance is boosted to 33\%.},

@inproceedings{wang2024coplanner,
  abstract = {Dyna-style model-based reinforcement learning contains two phases: model rollouts to generate sample for policy learning and real environment exploration using current policy for dynamics model learning. However, due to the complex real-world environment, it is inevitable to learn an imperfect dynamics model with model prediction error, which can further mislead policy learning and result in sub-optimal solutions. To address this issue, we propose {COPlanner}, a planning-driven framework for model-based methods that addresses the inaccurately learned dynamics model problem with conservative model rollouts and optimistic environment exploration. {COPlanner} leverages an uncertainty-aware policy-guided model predictive control ({UP-MPC}) component to plan for multi-step uncertainty estimation and can avoid model uncertain regions through conservative model rollouts, thereby alleviating the influence of model error. Simultaneously, it explores high-reward model uncertain regions to reduce model error actively through optimistic real environment exploration. The estimated uncertainty serves as a penalty during model rollouts and as a bonus during real environment exploration respectively, to choose actions. {COPlanner} is a plug-and-play framework that can be applied to any dyna-style model-based methods. Experimental results on a series of proprioceptive and visual continuous control tasks demonstrate that both sample efficiency and asymptotic performance of strong model-based methods are significantly improved combined with {COPlanner}.},

The proposed approach addresses three main issues with previous generalizable {NeRF} approaches: occlusions often result in inconsistent feature matching, they deliver distortions and artifacts in geometric discontinuities and locally sharp shapes due to their individual process of sampled points and rough feature aggregation, and their image-based representations experience severe degradations when source views are not near enough to the target view. We explicitly model visibilities by geometric priors and augment them with neural features. We propose a novel nonuniform log sampling strategy to improve both rendering speed and reconstruction quality, and a learnable kernel spatially augmented with features for feature aggregations, mitigating distortions at places with drastically varying geometries. Experiments show that our model can deliver better geometries, view consistencies, and rendering quality than all counterparts and benchmarks on three datasets in both generalization and finetuning settings.},

Therefore, such mechanisms are vulnerable to strategic clients aiming to optimize their own utility by misreporting. Instead of simply paying a client by its claimed cost, we decouple the calculation of incentive from the target client's reported cost, while preserving individual rationality through a critical-value based payment design that depends on all other clients' report cost. {Truth-FedBan} still guarantees the sub-linear regret and communication cost without any overhead.

In this paper, we consider a newly proposed weakly supervised learning problem called multi-class classification from multiple unlabeled datasets, where only multiple sets of unlabeled data and their class priors (i.e., the proportions of each class) are provided for training the classifier. To solve this problem, we first propose a classifier-consistent method (CCM) based on a probability transition matrix. However, CCM cannot guarantee risk consistency and lacks of purified supervision information during training. Therefore, we further propose a risk-consistent method (RCM) that progressively purifies supervision information during training by importance weighting. We provide comprehensive theoretical analyses for our methods to demonstrate the statistical consistency. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets and various prior matrices demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods.},

To solve the label shift adaption problem, we develop a novel matching framework named class probability matching (CPM). It is inspired by a new understanding of the source domain's class probability, as well as a specific relationship between class probability ratios and feature probability ratios between the source and target domains. CPM is able to maintain the same theoretical guarantee with the existing feature probability matching framework, while significantly improving the computational efficiency due to directly matching the probabilities of the label variable. Within the CPM framework, we propose an algorithm named class probability matching with calibrated networks (CPMCN) for target domain classification.},

Moreover, DiLu is able to directly acquire experiences from real-world datasets which highlights its potential to be deployed on practical autonomous driving systems.},

Our proposed method seamlessly integrates without disrupting sampling algorithms, and delivers high accuracy even at the first generation step, with a single generation per prompt. Building on our detection strategy, we unveil an explainable approach that shows the contribution of individual words or tokens to memorization.

They trained transformers by treating genes as tokens and cells as sentences. However, three fundamental differences between single-cell data and natural language data are overlooked: (1) scRNA-seq data are presented as bag-of-genes instead of sequences of RNAs; (2) Cell-cell relations are more intricate and important than inter-sentence relations; and (3) The quantity of single-cell data is considerably inferior to text data, and they are very noisy. In light of these characteristics, we propose a new pre-trained model, CellPLM, which takes cells as tokens and tissues as sentences. In addition, we leverage spatially-resolved transcriptomic data in pre-training to facilitate learning cell-cell relationships and introduce a Gaussian prior distribution as an additional inductive bias to overcome data limitations. CellPLM is the first single-cell pre-trained transformer that encodes cell-cell relations and it consistently outperforms existing pre-trained and non-pre-trained models in diverse downstream tasks, with 100 times higher inference speed on generating cell embeddings than previous pre-trained models.},

At the same time, models still show basic errors in understanding that would not be expected even in non-expert humans. This presents us with an apparent paradox: how do we reconcile seemingly superhuman capabilities with the persistence of errors that few humans would make? In this work, we posit that this tension reflects a divergence in the configuration of intelligence in today's generative models relative to intelligence in humans. Specifically, we propose and test the Generative AI Paradox hypothesis: generative models, having been trained directly to reproduce expert-like outputs, acquire generative capabilities that are not contingent upon—and can therefore exceed—their ability to understand those same types of outputs. This contrasts with humans, for whom basic understanding almost always precedes the ability to generate expert-level outputs. We test this hypothesis through controlled experiments analyzing generation vs. understanding in generative models, across both language and image modalities.},

Object-centric representations are widely conjectured to enable compositional generalization.

In this work, we investigate when compositional generalization is guaranteed for object-centric representations through the lens of identifiability theory. We show that autoencoders that satisfy structural assumptions on the decoder and enforce encoder-decoder consistency will learn object-centric representations that provably generalize compositionally. We formalize compositional generalization as an identifiability problem for a latent variable model where objects are represented by latent slots. We validate our theoretical result and highlight the practical relevance of our assumptions through experiments on synthetic image data.},

To accelerate the sampling process, prior studies have reformulated diffusion sampling as an ODE/SDE and introduced higher-order numerical methods. However, these methods often produce divergence artifacts, especially with a low number of sampling steps, which limits the achievable acceleration. In this paper, we investigate the potential causes of these artifacts and suggest that the small stability regions of these methods could be the principal cause. To address this issue, we propose two novel techniques. The first technique involves the incorporation of Heavy Ball momentum, a well-known technique for improving optimization, into existing diffusion numerical methods to expand their stability regions. We also prove that the resulting methods have first-order convergence. The second technique, called Generalized Heavy Ball, is a momentum-based sampling algorithm that achieves superior quality compared to previous momentum-based diffusion samplers.},

In this work, we introduce ALAM, a novel ACT framework that utilizes average quantization and a lightweight sensitivity calculation scheme, enabling large memory saving in LLMs while maintaining training performance. We first demonstrate that compressing activations into their group average values minimizes the gradient variance. Employing this property, we propose Average Quantization which provides high-quality deeply compressed activations with an effective precision of less than 1 bit and improved flexibility of precision allocation. We also present a cost-effective yet accurate sensitivity calculation algorithm that solely relies on the L2 norm of parameter gradients, substantially reducing memory overhead due to sensitivity calculation. In experiments, the ALAM framework significantly reduces activation memory without compromising accuracy, achieving up to a 10× compression rate in LLMs.},

In this work, we seek ways to reproduce and study training instability at smaller scales. We focus on two sources of training instability described in previous work: the growth of logits in attention layers and divergence of the output logits from the log probabilities. By measuring the relationship between learning rate and loss across scales, we show that these instabilities also appear in small models when training at high learning rates, and that mitigations previously employed at large scales are equally effective in this regime. We introduce a novel metric termed Learning Rate Sensitivity, which quantifies the expected deviation from an optimal loss when a model is trained with varied learning rates, and show that interventions like QK layer normalization and z-loss regularization mitigate these instabilities.},

In the linear MDP model, using randomization in algorithm design, we present an algorithm that is sample efficient (i.e., has near-optimal worst-case regret bounds) and has polynomial running time (i.e., computational complexity is polynomial with respect to relevant parameters). The algorithm further minimizes the query complexity through a novel randomized active learning procedure. In particular, our algorithm demonstrates a near-optimal tradeoff between the regret bound and the query complexity. To extend the results to more general nonlinear function approximation, we design a model-based randomized algorithm inspired by the idea of Thompson sampling. Our algorithm minimizes Bayesian regret bound and query complexity, again achieving a near-optimal tradeoff between these two quantities. Computation-wise, similar to the prior Thompson sampling algorithms under the regular RL setting, the main computation primitives of our algorithm are Bayesian supervised learning oracles.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in neural architecture search ({NAS}) emphasize the significance of considering robust architectures against malicious data. However, there is a notable absence of benchmark evaluations and theoretical guarantees for searching these robust architectures, especially when adversarial training is considered. In this work, we aim to address these two challenges, making twofold contributions. First, we release a comprehensive data set that encompasses both clean accuracy and robust accuracy for a vast array of adversarially trained networks from the {NAS-Bench-201} search space on image datasets. Then, leveraging the neural tangent kernel ({NTK}) tool from deep learning theory, we establish a generalization theory for searching architecture in terms of clean accuracy and robust accuracy under multi-objective adversarial training.},

@inproceedings{wu2024doubly,
  abstract = {Proximal causal learning is a powerful framework for identifying the causal effect under the existence of unmeasured confounders. Within this framework, the doubly robust ({DR}) estimator was derived and has shown its effectiveness in estimation, especially when the model assumption is violated. However, the current form of the {DR} estimator is restricted to binary treatments, while the treatments can be continuous in many real-world applications. The primary obstacle to continuous treatments resides in the delta function present in the original {DR} estimator, making it infeasible in causal effect estimation and introducing a heavy computational burden in nuisance function estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a kernel-based {DR} estimator that can well handle continuous treatments for proximal causal learning. Equipped with its smoothness, we show that its oracle form is a consistent approximation of the influence function. Further, we propose a new approach to efficiently solve the nuisance functions. We then provide a comprehensive convergence analysis in terms of the mean square error. We demonstrate the utility of our estimator on synthetic datasets and real-world applications.},

  abstract = {In federated learning ({FL}), incentivizing contributions of training resources (e.g., data, compute) from potentially competitive clients is crucial. Existing incentive mechanisms often distribute post-training monetary rewards, which suffer from practical challenges of timeliness and feasibility of the rewards. Rewarding the clients after the completion of training may incentivize them to abort the collaboration, and monetizing the contribution is challenging in practice. To address these problems, we propose an incentive-aware algorithm that offers differentiated training-time model rewards for each client at each {FL} iteration. We theoretically prove that such a local design ensures the global objective of client incentivization. Through theoretical analyses, we further identify the issue of error propagation in model rewards and thus propose a stochastic reference-model recovery strategy to ensure theoretically that all the clients eventually obtain the optimal model performance.},

@inproceedings{wu2024modulated,
  abstract = {To promote the safe deployment of object detectors, a task of unsupervised out-of-distribution object detection ({OOD-OD}) is recently proposed, aiming to detect unknown objects during training without reliance on any auxiliary {OOD} data. To alleviate the impact of lacking {OOD} data, for this task, one feasible solution is to exploit the known in-distribution ({ID}) data to synthesize proper {OOD} information for supervision, which strengthens detectors' discrimination. From the frequency perspective, since the phase generally reflects the content of the input, in this paper, we explore leveraging the phase of {ID} features to generate expected {OOD} features involving different content. And a method of Modulated Phase Diffusion ({MPD}) is proposed, containing a shared forward and two different reverse processes. Specifically, after calculating the phase of the extracted features, to prevent the rapid loss of content in the phase, the forward process gradually performs Gaussian Average on the phase instead of adding noise. The averaged phase and original amplitude are combined to obtain the features taken as the input of the reverse process. Next, one {OOD} branch is defined to synthesize virtual {OOD} features by continually enlarging the content discrepancy between the {OOD} features and original ones. Meanwhile, another modulated branch is designed to generate augmented features owning a similar phase as the original features by scaling and shifting the {OOD} branch. Both original and augmented features are used for training, enhancing the discrimination.},

@inproceedings{wu2024multimodal,
  abstract = {Multimodal patient representation learning aims to integrate information from multiple modalities and generate comprehensive patient representations for subsequent clinical predictive tasks. However, many existing approaches either presuppose the availability of all modalities and labels for each patient or only deal with missing modalities. In reality, patient data often comes with both missing modalities and labels for various reasons (i.e., the missing modality and label issue). Moreover, multimodal models might over-rely on certain modalities, causing sub-optimal performance when these modalities are absent (i.e., the modality collapse issue). To address these challenges, we propose {MUSE}, a mutual-consistent graph contrastive learning method that uses a flexible bipartite graph to represent the patient-modality relationship, which can adapt to various missing modality patterns. To tackle the modality collapse issue, {MUSE} learns to focus on modality-general and label-decisive features via a mutual-consistent contrastive learning loss. Notably, the unsupervised component of the contrastive objective only requires self-supervision signals, thereby broadening the training scope to incorporate patients with missing labels. We evaluate {MUSE} on three publicly available datasets: {MIMIC-IV}, {eICU}, and {ADNI}. Results show that {MUSE} outperforms all baselines, and {MUSE}+ further elevates the absolute improvement to $\sim$4\% by extending the training scope to patients with absent labels.},

However, due to privacy restrictions, few public real-world {VFL} datasets exist for algorithm evaluation, and these represent a limited array of feature distributions. Existing benchmarks often resort to synthetic datasets, derived from arbitrary feature splits from a global set, which only capture a subset of feature distributions, leading to inadequate algorithm performance assessment. This paper addresses these shortcomings by introducing two key factors affecting {VFL} performance - feature importance and feature correlation - and proposing associated evaluation metrics and dataset splitting methods.

In essence, {STanHop} sequentially learns temporal representation and cross-series representation using two tandem sparse Hopfield layers. Additionally, {STanHop} incorporates two external memory modules: Plug-and-Play and Tune-and-Play for train-less and task-aware memory enhancements, respectively. They allow {STanHop-Net} to swiftly respond to sudden events. From the theoretical perspective, we introduce a unified construction (Generalized Sparse Modern Hopfield Model) for both dense and sparse modern Hopfield models and show that it endows a tighter memory retrieval error compared to the dense counterpart without sacrificing memory capacity. We validate the efficacy of {STanHop-Net} on many settings: time series prediction, fast test-time adaptation, and strongly correlated time series prediction.},

The modular architecture of {LoRA} has catalyzed further research into the synergistic composition of multiple trained {LoRAs}, aiming to amplify performance across various tasks. However, the effective composition of these trained {LoRAs} presents a formidable challenge: Linear arithmetic composition can lead to the diminution of the generative capabilities inherent in the original pre-trained models or the distinctive attributes of the individually trained {LoRAs}, potentially resulting in suboptimal outcomes. To address this challenge, we introduce Mixture of {LoRA} Experts ({MoLE}), a method that achieves a more efficient and flexible composition of multiple trained {LoRAs} by employing hierarchical weight control through learnable gating functions within each layer of trained {LoRAs}. Extensive experiments on both {V\&L} and {NLP} domain demonstrate that {MoLE} can enhance {LoRA} composition performance and mitigates issues associated with existing composition methods.},

@inproceedings{wu2024meta,
  abstract = {Regularization-based methods have so far been among the \textit{de facto} choices for continual learning. Recent theoretical studies have revealed that these methods all boil down to relying on the Hessian matrix approximation of model weights. However, these methods suffer from suboptimal trade-offs between knowledge transfer and forgetting due to fixed and unchanging Hessian estimations during training. Another seemingly parallel strand of Meta-Continual Learning (Meta-{CL}) algorithms enforces alignment between gradients of previous tasks and that of the current task. In this work we revisit Meta-{CL} and for the first time bridge it with regularization-based methods. Concretely, Meta-{CL} implicitly approximates Hessian in an online manner, which enjoys the benefits of timely adaptation but meantime suffers from high variance induced by random memory buffer sampling. We are thus highly motivated to combine the best of both worlds, through the proposal of Variance Reduced Meta-{CL} ({VR-MCL}) to achieve both timely and accurate Hessian approximation. Through comprehensive experiments across three datasets and various settings, we consistently observe that {VR-MCL} outperforms other {SOTA} methods, which further validates the effectiveness of {VR-MCL}.},

We provide a differentially private framework for aligning LLMs with RL that mathematically guarantees that the final model satisfies DP over the entire course of the alignment process, consisting of multiple stages of model training and weight sharing. We show how to adapt the PPO algorithm to the DP setting and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on standard benchmarks.},

Therefore, we first compress the input into a lower-dimensional latent space and then train a diffusion model on it. Specifically, we encode the input 3D textured shape into triplane feature maps that represent the signed distance and texture fields of the input. We first train an autoencoder to compress the input 3D textured shape into triplane feature maps, which are three axis-aligned 2D feature maps that, together with the decoder, implicitly represent the signed distance and texture fields of the input. Then, we train a diffusion model on the triplane feature maps to learn the distribution of the latent features. Aside from randomly generating new samples, our model also facilitates applications such as retargeting, outpainting and local editing. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we show that our model can generate 3D shapes of various types with better quality than prior methods.},

It originates from the classical Bongard Problems (BPs): Given two sets of images (positive and negative), the model needs to identify the set that query images belong to by inducing the visual concepts, which is exclusively depicted by images from the positive set. Our benchmark inherits the few-shot concept induction of the original BPs while adding the two novel layers of challenge: 1) open-world free-form concepts, as the visual concepts in Bongard-OpenWorld are unique compositions of terms from an open vocabulary, ranging from object categories to abstract visual attributes and commonsense factual knowledge; 2) real-world images, as opposed to the synthetic diagrams used by many counterparts. In our exploration, Bongard-OpenWorld already imposes a significant challenge to current few-shot reasoning algorithms. We further investigate to which extent the recently introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve our task, by directly probing VLMs, and combining VLMs and LLMs in an interactive reasoning scheme. We even conceived a neuro-symbolic reasoning approach that reconciles LLMs and VLMs with logical reasoning to emulate the human problem-solving process for Bongard Problems. However, none of these approaches manage to close the human-machine gap, as the best learner achieves 64% accuracy while human participants easily reach 91%. We hope Bongard-OpenWorld can help us better understand the limitations of current visual intelligence and facilitate future research on visual agents with stronger few-shot visual reasoning capabilities.},

Inverse design is typically formulated as an optimization problem, with recent works leveraging optimization across learned dynamics models. However, as models are optimized they tend to fall into adversarial modes, preventing effective sampling. We illustrate that by instead optimizing over the learned energy function captured by the diffusion model, we can avoid such adversarial examples and significantly improve design performance. We propose a novel formulation for inverse design as an energy optimization problem and introduce Compositional Inverse Design with Diffusion Models (CinDM) to enable generalization to out-of-distribution and more complex design inputs than seen in training, which outperforms existing works in n-body and 2D airfoil design.

  abstract = {In-context learning (ICL) is an important capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling these models to dynamically adapt based on specific, in-context exemplars, thereby improving accuracy and relevance. However, LLM's responses may leak the sensitive private information contained in in-context exemplars. To address this challenge, we propose Differentially Private In-context Learning (DP-ICL), a general paradigm for privatizing ICL tasks. The key idea for DP-ICL paradigm is generating differentially private responses through a noisy consensus among an ensemble of LLM's responses based on disjoint exemplar sets. Based on the general paradigm of DP-ICL, we instantiate several techniques showing how to privatize ICL for text classification and language generation. We evaluate DP-ICL on four text classification benchmarks and two language generation tasks, and our empirical results show that DP-ICL achieves a strong utility-privacy tradeoff.},

  abstract = {Nature performs complex computations constantly at clearly lower cost and higher performance than digital computers. It is crucial to understand how to harness the unique computational power of nature in Machine Learning (ML). In the past decade, besides the development of Neural Networks (NNs), the community has also relentlessly explored nature-powered ML paradigms. Although most of them are still predominantly theoretical, a new practical paradigm enabled by the recent advent of CMOS-compatible room-temperature nature-based computers has emerged. By harnessing a dynamical system's intrinsic behavior of chasing the lowest energy state, this paradigm can solve some simple binary problems delivering considerable speedup and energy savings compared with NNs, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Regrettably, its values to the real world are highly constrained by its binary nature. A clear pathway to its extension to real-valued problems remains elusive. We demonstrate orders of magnitude of speedup and energy efficiency in Graph Learning compared to baseline GNNs by extending binary Ising machines to real-valued dynamical systems through hardware architecture and Hamiltonian co-design for graph learning problems.},

  abstract = {We present MOFI, Manifold OF Images, a new vision foundation model designed to learn image representations from noisy entity annotated images. MOFI differs from previous work in two key aspects: 1. pre-training data, and 2. training recipe. Regarding data, we introduce a new approach to automatically assign entity labels to images from noisy image-text pairs. Our approach involves employing a named entity recognition model to extract entities from the alt-text, and then using a CLIP model to select the correct entities as labels of the paired image. It's a simple, cost-effective method that can scale to handle billions of web-mined image-text pairs. Through this method, we have created Image-to-Entities (I2E), a new dataset with 1 billion images and 2 million distinct entities, covering rich visual concepts in the wild. Building upon the I2E dataset, we study different training recipes like supervised pre-training, contrastive pre-training, and multi-task learning. For contrastive pre-training, we treat entity names as free-form text, and further enrich them with entity descriptions. Experiments show that supervised pre-training with large-scale fine-grained entity labels is highly effective for image retrieval tasks, and multi-task training further improves the performance. The final MOFI model achieves 86.66% mAP on the challenging GPR1200 dataset, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art performance of 72.19% from OpenAI's CLIP model.},

@inproceedings{wu2024offpolicy,
  abstract = {Primal-dual safe RL methods commonly perform iterations between the primal update of the policy and the dual update of the Lagrange Multiplier. Such a training paradigm is highly susceptible to the error in cumulative cost estimation since this estimation serves as the key bond connecting the primal and dual update processes. We show that this problem causes significant underestimation of cost when using off-policy methods, leading to the failure to satisfy the safety constraint. To address this issue, we propose conservative policy optimization, which learns a policy in a constraint-satisfying area by considering the uncertainty in cost estimation. This improves constraint satisfaction but also potentially hinders reward maximization. We then introduce local policy convexification to help eliminate such suboptimality by gradually reducing the estimation uncertainty. We provide theoretical interpretations of the joint coupling effect of these two ingredients and further verify them by extensive experiments. Results on benchmark tasks show that our method not only achieves an asymptotic performance comparable to state-of-the-art on-policy methods while using much fewer samples, but also significantly reduces constraint violation during training.},

However, the overconfident target harms generalization and causes the problem of robust overfitting. To address this issue and enhance adversarial robustness, we analyze the characteristics of robust models and identify that robust models tend to produce smoother and well-calibrated outputs. Based on the observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, Annealing Self-Distillation Rectification (ADR), which generates soft labels as a better guidance mechanism that reflects the underlying distribution of data. By utilizing ADR, we can obtain rectified distributions that significantly improve model robustness without the need for pre-trained models or extensive extra computation. Moreover, our method facilitates seamless plug-and-play integration with other adversarial training techniques by replacing the hard labels in their objectives. We demonstrate the efficacy of ADR through extensive experiments and strong performances across datasets.},

However, integrating retrievals in non-knowledge-intensive (NKI) tasks is still challenging. Existing works focus on concatenating retrievals with inputs to improve model performance. Unfortunately, the use of retrieval concatenation-based augmentations causes an increase in the input length, substantially raising the computational demands of attention mechanisms. This paper proposes a new paradigm of RA named ReFusion, a computation-efficient Retrieval representation Fusion with bi-level optimization. Unlike previous works, ReFusion directly fuses the retrieval representations into the hidden states of models. Specifically, ReFusion leverages an adaptive retrieval integrator to seek the optimal combination of the proposed ranking schemes across different model layers.

@inproceedings{wu2024embodied,
  abstract = {The vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial patches has motivated numerous defense strategies for boosting model robustness. However, the prevailing defenses depend on single observation or pre-established adversary information to counter adversarial patches, often failing to be confronted with unseen or adaptive adversarial attacks and easily exhibiting unsatisfying performance in dynamic 3D environments. Inspired by active human perception and recurrent feedback mechanisms, we develop Embodied Active Defense (EAD), a proactive defensive strategy that actively contextualizes environmental information to address misaligned adversarial patches in 3D real-world settings. These models recurrently process a series of beliefs and observations, facilitating progressive refinement of their comprehension of the target object and enabling the development of strategic actions to counter adversarial patches in 3D environments. To optimize learning efficiency, we incorporate a differentiable approximation of environmental dynamics and deploy patches that are agnostic to the adversary's strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EAD substantially enhances robustness against a variety of patches within just a few steps through its action policy in safety-critical tasks (e.g., face recognition and object detection), without compromising standard accuracy. Furthermore, due to the attack-agnostic characteristic, EAD facilitates excellent generalization to unseen attacks, diminishing the averaged attack success rate by 95\% across a range of unseen adversarial attacks.},

We introduce a new bi-modal latent diffusion structure that utilizes both RGB and depth panoramic data during training, which works surprisingly well to outpaint depth-free RGB images during inference. We further propose a novel technique of introducing progressive camera rotations during each diffusion denoising step, which leads to substantial improvement in achieving panorama wraparound consistency. Results show that our PanoDiffusion not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-D panorama outpainting by producing diverse well-structured results for different types of masks, but can also synthesize high-quality depth panoramas to provide realistic 3D indoor models.},

In this paper, we study ICL in one of its simplest setups: pretraining a single-layer linear attention model for linear regression with a Gaussian prior. We establish a statistical learning theory for this setting, providing finite-sample convergence guarantees and sample complexity bounds. Our theoretical analysis reveals how the number of pretraining tasks, the number of examples per task, task diversity, and model capacity jointly determine the ICL performance. Specifically, we prove that when the total number of pretraining samples is fixed, the optimal number of pretraining tasks grows as a power law of the total sample size, which matches empirical observations. We also identify the phase transition phenomenon: a large number of pretraining tasks is necessary for ICL to perform better than zero-shot learning.},

However, recent works have shown that simply transferring the image-level CLIP representations to dense prediction tasks leads to suboptimal performance due to the domain shift from global to local image patches. To address this issue, we propose CLIPSelf, a self-distillation approach that distills the knowledge from the global CLIP vision transformer to local patch representations. CLIPSelf leverages the rich semantic information in CLIP's global representation to guide the learning of local patch embeddings through a teacher-student framework. The teacher network processes the full image to produce global semantics, while the student network learns to predict local patch representations that are aligned with both the global context and local visual features. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple dense prediction benchmarks, we demonstrate that CLIPSelf significantly improves the transfer of CLIP representations to local tasks, achieving substantial performance gains over existing methods.},

Regardless, the cost of training such models from scratch on trillions of tokens remains high. In this work, we study structured pruning as an effective means to develop smaller {LLMs} from pre-trained, larger models. Our approach employs two key techniques: (1) targeted structured pruning, which prunes a larger model to a specified target shape by removing layers, heads, and intermediate and hidden dimensions in an end-to-end manner, and (2) dynamic batch loading, which dynamically updates the composition of sampled data in each training batch based on varying losses across different domains. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated by presenting the {Sheared-LLaMA} series, pruning the {LLaMA2-7B} model down to 1.3B and 2.7B parameters. {Sheared-LLaMA} models outperform state-of-the-art open-source models of equivalent sizes, such as {Pythia}, {INCITE}, {OpenLLaMA} and the concurrent {TinyLlama} models, on a wide range of downstream and instruction tuning evaluations, while requiring only 3\% of compute compared to training such models from scratch. This work provides compelling evidence that leveraging existing {LLMs} with structured pruning is a far more cost-effective approach for building competitive small-scale {LLMs}.},

However, it faces the curse of dimensionality: as the input dimension increases, the upper bound of $\ell_2$ certified robustness radius exhibits a diminishing trend, proportionally decreasing at a rate of approximately $1/\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ represents the input dimension. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Randomized Smoothing ({DRS}), which enables high-dimensional input certification by down-sampling the input image and applying smoothing in the lower-dimensional space. {DRS} consists of two smoothing operations applied sequentially: the first smoothing operates on the down-sampled image, and the second smoothing is applied to the original high-dimensional input. We provide theoretical analysis showing that {DRS} can achieve a better certified robustness radius than traditional {RS}, especially in high-dimensional cases. Our extensive experiments on {CIFAR}-10 and {ImageNet} demonstrate that {DRS} significantly improves the certified robustness compared to existing methods. Particularly, on {ImageNet}, {DRS} achieves up to $5\times$ improvement in terms of certified robustness radius over the baseline randomized smoothing approach.},

However, many studies show an attacker could carefully perturb the structure and/or node features in a graph such that a graph classifier misclassifies the perturbed graph. Such vulnerability impedes the deployment of graph classification in security/safety-critical applications. Existing empirical defenses lack formal robustness guarantees and could be broken by adaptive or unknown attacks. Existing provable defenses have the following limitations: 1) they achieve sub-optimal robustness guarantees for graph structure perturbation, 2) they cannot provide robustness guarantees for arbitrarily node feature perturbations, 3) their robustness guarantees are probabilistic, meaning they could be incorrect with a non-zero probability, and 4) they incur large computation costs. We aim to address those limitations in this work. We propose {GNNCert}, a certified defense against both graph structure and node feature perturbations for graph classification. Our {GNNCert} provably predicts the same label for a graph when the number of perturbed edges and the number of nodes with perturbed features are bounded.

To address this, we enhance the spatial-temporal capability and introduce a versatile video generation model, {VersVideo}, which leverages textual, visual, and stylistic conditions. Current video diffusion models typically extend image diffusion architectures by supplementing 2D operations (such as convolutions and attentions) with temporal operations. While this approach is efficient, it often restricts spatial-temporal performance. To counter this, we incorporate two key elements: (1) multi-excitation paths for spatial-temporal convolutions with dimension pooling across different axes, and (2) multi-expert spatial-temporal attention blocks. These enhancements boost the model's spatial-temporal performance without significantly escalating training and inference costs. We also tackle the issue of information loss that arises when a variational autoencoder is used to transform pixel space into latent features and then back into pixel frames. To mitigate this, we incorporate temporal modules into the decoder to maintain inter-frame consistency. Lastly, by utilizing the innovative denoising {UNet} and decoder, we develop a unified {ControlNet} model suitable for various conditions, including image, {Canny}, {HED}, depth, and style.},

@inproceedings{xiang2024badchain,
  abstract = {Large language models ({LLMs}) are shown to benefit from chain-of-thought ({COT}) prompting, particularly when tackling tasks that require systematic reasoning processes. On the other hand, {COT} prompting also poses new vulnerabilities in the form of backdoor attacks, wherein the model will output unintended malicious content under specific backdoor-triggered conditions during inference. Traditional methods for launching backdoor attacks involve either contaminating the training dataset with backdoored instances or directly manipulating the model parameters during deployment. However, these approaches are not practical for commercial {LLMs} that typically operate via {API} access. In this paper, we propose {BadChain}, the first backdoor attack against {LLMs} employing {COT} prompting, which does not require access to the training dataset or model parameters and imposes low computational overhead. {BadChain} leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of {LLMs} by inserting a backdoor reasoning step into the sequence of reasoning steps of the model output, thereby altering the final response when a backdoor trigger exists in the query prompt. In particular, a subset of demonstrations will be manipulated to incorporate a backdoor reasoning step in {COT} prompting. Consequently, given any query prompt containing the backdoor trigger, the {LLM} will be misled to output unintended content. Empirically, we show the effectiveness of {BadChain} for two {COT} strategies across four {LLMs} ({Llama2}, {GPT-3.5}, {PaLM2}, and {GPT-4}) and six complex benchmark tasks encompassing arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning. We show that the baseline backdoor attacks designed for simpler tasks such as semantic classification will fail on these complicated tasks. Moreover, we show that {LLMs} endowed with stronger reasoning capabilities exhibit higher susceptibility to {BadChain}, exemplified by a high average attack success rate of 97.0\% across the six benchmark tasks on {GPT-4}. We also demonstrate the interpretability of {BadChain} by showing that the relationship between the trigger and the backdoor reasoning step can be well-explained based on the output of the backdoored model. Finally, we propose two defenses based on shuffling and demonstrate their overall ineffectiveness against {BadChain}. Therefore, {BadChain} remains a severe threat to {LLMs}, underscoring the urgency for the development of robust and effective future defenses.},

  abstract = {Federated Long-Tailed Learning ({Fed-LT}), a paradigm wherein data collected from decentralized local clients manifests a globally prevalent long-tailed distribution, has garnered considerable attention in recent times. In the context of {Fed-LT}, existing works have predominantly centered on addressing the data imbalance issue to enhance the efficacy of the generic global model while neglecting the performance at the local level. In contrast, conventional Personalized Federated Learning ({pFL}) techniques are primarily devised to optimize personalized local models under the presumption of a balanced global data distribution. This paper introduces an approach termed Federated Local and Generic Model Training in {Fed-LT} ({FedLoGe}), which enhances both local and generic model performance through the integration of representation learning and classifier alignment within a neural collapse framework. Furthermore, leveraging insights from imbalance neural collapse's classifier norm patterns, we develop Global and Local Adaptive Feature Realignment ({GLA-FR}) via an auxiliary global classifier and personalized {Euclidean} norm transfer to align global features with client preferences. Extensive experimental results on {CIFAR}-10/100-{LT}, {ImageNet-LT}, and {iNaturalist} demonstrate the advantage of our method over state-of-the-art {pFL} and {Fed-LT} approaches.},

  abstract = {Recent text-to-image ({T2I}) diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in generating high-quality images given text-prompts as input. However, these models fail to convey appropriate spatial composition specified by a layout instruction. In this work, we probe into zero-shot grounded {T2I} generation with diffusion models, that is, generating images corresponding to the input layout information without training auxiliary modules or finetuning diffusion models. We propose a Region and Boundary ({R\&B}) aware cross-attention guidance approach that gradually modulates the attention maps of diffusion model during generative process, and assists the model to synthesize images (1) with high fidelity, (2) highly compatible with textual input, and (3) interpreting layout instructions accurately. Specifically, we leverage the discrete sampling to bridge the gap between consecutive attention maps and discrete layout constraints, and design a region-aware loss to refine the generative layout during diffusion process. We further propose a boundary-aware loss to strengthen object discriminability within the corresponding regions. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art zero-shot grounded {T2I} generation methods by a large margin both qualitatively and quantitatively on several benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Integrating and processing information from various sources or modalities are critical for obtaining a comprehensive and accurate perception of the real world in autonomous systems and cyber-physical systems. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience, we develop the Information-Theoretic Hierarchical Perception ({ITHP}) model, which utilizes the concept of information bottleneck. Different from most traditional fusion models that incorporate all modalities identically in neural networks, our model designates a prime modality and regards the remaining modalities as detectors in the information pathway, serving to distill the flow of information. Our proposed perception model focuses on constructing an effective and compact information flow by achieving a balance between the minimization of mutual information between the latent state and the input modal state, and the maximization of mutual information between the latent states and the remaining modal states. This approach leads to compact latent state representations that retain relevant information while minimizing redundancy, thereby substantially enhancing the performance of multimodal representation learning. Experimental evaluations on the {MUStARD}, {CMU-MOSI}, and {CMU-MOSEI} datasets demonstrate that our model consistently distills crucial information in multimodal learning scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks. Remarkably, on the {CMU-MOSI} dataset, {ITHP} surpasses human-level performance in the multimodal sentiment binary classification task across all evaluation metrics (i.e., Binary Accuracy, {F1} Score, Mean Absolute Error, and Pearson Correlation).},

These large language models can achieve superior performance in various tasks and even yield emergent capabilities, e.g., reasoning and universal generalization.

Experimental results demonstrate that our fine-tuned model, {Instruct-XMLR}, outperforms {Bloomz} on all evaluation tasks and achieves comparable performance with {mT0} on most tasks. Surprisingly, {Instruct-XMLR} also possesses strong task and language generalization abilities, indicating that {Instruct-XMLR} can also serve as a good instruction follower and zero-shot learner. Besides, {Instruct-XMLR} can accelerate decoding due to its non-autoregressive generation manner, achieving around 3 times speedup compared with current autoregressive large language models.},

We observe the attention sink phenomenon: keeping the {KV} of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. Based on this analysis, we introduce {StreamingLLM}, an efficient framework that enables {LLMs} trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence length without any fine-tuning.

The main idea behind {SMA} is that masking inputs based on a model's attention map can create a strong, domain-agnostic masking strategy for masked modeling. We evaluate {SMA} on three self-supervised learning benchmarks in protein biology, chemical property prediction, and particle physics, and show that {SMA} achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining domain-agnostic.},

We propose a systematic framework to elicit high-quality parametric memory from {LLMs} and construct the corresponding counter-memory, which enables us to conduct a series of controlled experiments. Our investigation reveals that {LLMs} can be highly receptive to external evidence even when that conflicts with their parametric memory, given that the external evidence is coherent and convincing. We show that {LLMs} demonstrate adaptive behavior in handling knowledge conflicts: they are more likely to rely on external evidence when their parametric memory is uncertain or when the external evidence is of higher quality. However, we also identify seemingly contradictory behaviors of {LLMs}, suggesting room for improvement in their knowledge integration mechanisms.},

The existing methodologies in the field primarily concentrate on constructing models that capture the relationship between utility function values and subsets within their respective supersets. However, these approaches tend to overlook the valuable information contained within the superset when utilizing neural networks to model set functions. In this work, we address this oversight by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Our theoretical findings demonstrate that when the target value is conditioned on both the input set and subset, it is essential to incorporate an invariant sufficient statistic of the superset into the subset of interest for effective learning. We term this process background information integration. We validate our theoretical insights through comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including compound selection for drug discovery, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing neural subset selection performance.},

First, we introduce analytic spatial guidance that ensures the generated motion can tightly conform to the input control signals. Second, realism guidance is introduced to refine all the joints to generate more coherent motion. Both the spatial and realism guidance are essential and they are highly complementary for balancing control accuracy and motion realism.

  abstract = {The information bottleneck principle provides an information-theoretic method for learning a good representation as a trade-off between conciseness and predictive ability, which can reduce information redundancy, eliminate irrelevant and superfluous features, and thus enhance the in-domain generalizability. However, in low-resource or out-of-domain scenarios where the assumption of i.i.d does not necessarily hold true, superfluous (or redundant) relevant features may be supplemental to the mainline features of the model, and be beneficial in making prediction for test dataset with distribution shift. Therefore, instead of squeezing the input information by information bottleneck, we propose to keep as much relevant information as possible in use for making predictions. A three-stage supervised learning framework is designed and implemented to jointly learn the mainline and supplemental features, relieving supplemental features from the suppression of mainline features. Extensive experiments have shown that the learned representations of our method have good in-domain and out-of-domain generalization abilities, especially in low-resource cases.},

Our defense falls within the category of post-development defenses that operate independently of how the model was generated. The proposed defense is built upon a novel reverse engineering approach that can directly extract backdoor functionality of a given backdoored model to a backdoor expert model. The approach is straightforward -- finetuning the backdoored model over a small set of intentionally mislabeled clean samples, such that it unlearns the normal functionality while still preserving the backdoor functionality, and thus resulting in a model (dubbed a backdoor expert model) that can only recognize backdoor inputs. Based on the extracted backdoor expert model, we show the feasibility of devising highly accurate backdoor input detectors that filter out the backdoor inputs during model inference. Further augmented by an ensemble strategy with a finetuned auxiliary model, our defense, BaDExpert (Backdoor Input Detection with Backdoor Expert), effectively mitigates 17 {SOTA} backdoor attacks while minimally impacting clean utility.

To address this, we introduce Text2Reward, a data-free framework that automates the generation and shaping of dense reward functions based on large language models ({LLMs}). Given a goal described in natural language, Text2Reward generates shaped dense reward functions as an executable program grounded in a compact representation of the environment. Unlike inverse {RL} and recent work that uses {LLMs} to write sparse reward codes or unshaped dense rewards with a constant function across timesteps, Text2Reward produces interpretable, free-form dense reward codes that cover a wide range of tasks, utilize existing packages, and allow iterative refinement with human feedback. We evaluate Text2Reward on two robotic manipulation benchmarks ({ManiSkill2}, {MetaWorld}) and two locomotion environments of {MuJoCo}. On 13 of the 17 manipulation tasks, policies trained with generated reward codes achieve similar or better task success rates and convergence speed than expert-written reward codes. For locomotion tasks, our method learns six novel locomotion behaviors with a success rate exceeding 94\%. Furthermore, we show that the policies trained in the simulator with our method can be deployed in the real world. Finally, Text2Reward further improves the policies by refining their reward functions with human feedback. Video results are available at https://text-to-reward.github.io/.},

  abstract = {This paper rigorously shows how over-parameterization changes the convergence behaviors of gradient descent (GD) for the matrix sensing problem, where the goal is to recover an unknown low-rank ground-truth matrix from near-isotropic linear measurements. First, we consider the symmetric setting with the symmetric parameterization where $M^* \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is a positive semi-definite unknown matrix of rank $r \ll n$, and one uses a symmetric parameterization $XX^\top$ to learn $M^*$. Here $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ with $k > r$ is the factor matrix. We give a novel $\Omega(1/T^2)$ lower bound of randomly initialized GD for the over-parameterized case ($k >r$) where $T$ is the number of iterations. This is in stark contrast to the exact-parameterization scenario ($k=r$) where the convergence rate is $\exp(-\Omega(T))$. Next, we study asymmetric setting where $M^* \in \mathbb{R}^{n_1 \times n_2}$ is the unknown matrix of rank $r \ll \min\{n_1,n_2\}$, and one uses an asymmetric parameterization $FG^\top$ to learn $M^*$ where $F \in \mathbb{R}^{n_1 \times k}$ and $G \in \mathbb{R}^{n_2 \times k}$. Building on prior work, we give a global exact convergence result of randomly initialized GD for the exact-parameterization case ($k=r$) with an $\exp(-\Omega(T))$ rate. Furthermore, we give the first global exact convergence result for the over-parameterization case ($k>r$) with an $\exp(-\Omega(\alpha^2 T))$ rate where $\alpha$ is the initialization scale. This linear convergence result in the over-parameterization case is especially significant because one can apply the asymmetric parameterization to the symmetric setting to speed up from $\Omega(1/T^2)$ to linear convergence.},

Previous methods, which primarily rely on model logits, have become less suitable for LLMs and even infeasible with the rise of closed-source LLMs (e.g., commercialized LLM APIs). This leads to a growing need to explore the untapped area of non-logit-based approaches to estimate the uncertainty of LLMs. Hence, in this study, we investigate approaches for confidence elicitation that do not require model fine-tuning or access to proprietary information. We introduce three categories of methods: verbalize-based, consistency-based, and their hybrid methods for benchmarking, and evaluate their performance across five types of datasets and four widely-used LLMs. Our analysis of these methods uncovers several key insights: 1) LLMs often exhibit a high degree of overconfidence when verbalizing their confidence; 2) Prompting strategies such as CoT, Top-K and Multi-step confidences improve calibration of verbalized confidence; 3) Consistency-based methods outperform the verbalized confidences in most cases, with particularly notable improvements on the arithmetic reasoning task; 4) Hybrid methods consistently deliver the best performance over their baselines, thereby emerging as a promising state-of-the-art approach; 5) Despite these advancements, all investigated methods continue to struggle with challenging tasks, such as those requiring professional knowledge, leaving significant scope for improvement of confidence elicitation.},

In order to find the minimum assumption for sample-efficient learning, we introduce a novel complexity measure called the Multi-Agent Decoupling Coefficient (MADC) for general-sum MGs. Using this measure, we propose the first unified algorithmic framework that ensures sample efficiency in learning Nash Equilibrium, Coarse Correlated Equilibrium, and Correlated Equilibrium for both model-based and model-free MARL problems with low MADC. We also show that our algorithm provides comparable sublinear regret to the existing works. Moreover, our algorithm combines an equilibrium-solving oracle with a single objective optimization subprocedure that solves for the regularized payoff of each deterministic joint policy, thus being more amenable to empirical implementation.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in natural language processing, primarily propelled by Large Language Models (LLMs), have showcased their remarkable capabilities grounded in in-context learning. A promising avenue for guiding LLMs in intricate reasoning tasks involves the utilization of intermediate reasoning steps within the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm. Nevertheless, the central challenge lies in the effective selection of exemplars for facilitating in-context learning. In this study, we introduce a framework that leverages Dual Queries and Low-rank approximation Re-ranking (DQ-LoRe) to automatically select exemplars for in-context learning. Dual Queries first query LLM to obtain LLM-generated knowledge such as CoT, then query the retriever to obtain the final exemplars via both question and the knowledge. Moreover, for the second query, LoRe employs dimensionality reduction techniques to refine exemplar selection, ensuring close alignment with the input question's knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DQ-LoRe significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in the automatic selection of exemplars for GPT-4, enhancing performance from 92.5% to 94.2%. Our comprehensive analysis further reveals that DQ-LoRe consistently outperforms retrieval-based approaches in terms of both performance and adaptability, especially in scenarios characterized by distribution shifts.},

  abstract = {Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in various NLP tasks. However, these advances have not been reflected in the translation task, especially those with moderate model sizes (i.e., 7B or 13B parameters), which still lag behind conventional supervised encoder-decoder translation models. Previous studies have attempted to improve the translation capabilities of these LLMs, but their gains have been limited. In this study, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach for LLMs that is specifically designed for the translation task, eliminating the need for the abundant parallel data that traditional translation models usually depend on. Our approach consists of two fine-tuning stages: initial fine-tuning on monolingual data followed by subsequent fine-tuning on a small set of high-quality parallel data. We introduce the LLM developed through this strategy as Advanced Language Model-based trAnslator (ALMA). Based on LLaMA-2 as our underlying model, our results show that the model can achieve an average improvement of more than 12 BLEU and 12 COMET over its zero-shot performance across 10 translation directions from the WMT'21 (2 directions) and WMT'22 (8 directions) test datasets. The performance is significantly better than all prior work and even superior to the NLLB-54B model and GPT-3.5-text-davinci-003, with only 7B or 13B parameters. This method establishes the foundation for a novel training paradigm in machine translation.},

The problem becomes more difficult with the presence of unobserved confounding variables. The front-door adjustment is an approach for dealing with unobserved confounding variables. However, the restriction for the standard front-door adjustment is difficult to satisfy in practice. In this paper, we relax some of the restrictions by proposing the concept of conditional front-door (CFD) adjustment and develop the theorem that guarantees the causal effect identifiability of CFD adjustment. By leveraging the ability of deep generative models, we propose CFDiVAE to learn the representation of the CFD adjustment variable directly from data with the identifiable Variational AutoEncoder and formally prove the model identifiability. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of CFDiVAE and its superiority over existing methods. The experiments also show that the performance of CFDiVAE is less sensitive to the causal strength of unobserved confounding variables. We further apply CFDiVAE to a real-world dataset to demonstrate its potential application.},

This enables the transfer of knowledge from pretrained weights to smaller models. Our experiments demonstrate that weight selection can significantly enhance the performance of small models and reduce their training time. Notably, it can also be used together with knowledge distillation.

@inproceedings{xu2024towards,
  abstract = {Recent studies revealed that using third-party models may lead to backdoor threats, where adversaries can maliciously manipulate model predictions based on backdoors implanted during model training. Arguably, backdoor trigger inversion (BTI), which generates trigger patterns of given benign samples for a backdoored model, is the most critical module for backdoor defenses used in these scenarios. With BTI, defenders can remove backdoors by fine-tuning based on generated poisoned samples with ground-truth labels or deactivate backdoors by removing trigger patterns during the inference process. However, we find that existing BTI methods suffer from relatively poor performance, i.e., their generated triggers are significantly different from the ones used by the adversaries even in the feature space. We argue that it is mostly because existing methods require to 'extract' backdoor features at first, while this task is very difficult since defenders have no information (e.g., trigger pattern or target label) about poisoned samples. In this paper, we explore BTI from another perspective where we decouple benign features instead of decoupling backdoor features directly. Specifically, our method consists of two main steps, including (1) decoupling benign features and (2) trigger inversion by minimizing the differences between benign samples and their generated poisoned version in decoupled benign features while maximizing the differences in remaining backdoor features. In particular, our method is more efficient since it doesn't need to 'scan' all classes to speculate the target label, as required by existing BTI. We also exploit our BTI module to further design backdoor-removal and pre-processing-based defenses. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our defenses can reach state-of-the-art performances.},

  abstract = {In deep metric learning, the triplet loss has emerged as a popular method to learn many computer vision and natural language processing tasks such as facial recognition, object detection, and visual-semantic embeddings. One issue that plagues the triplet loss is network collapse, an undesirable phenomenon where the network projects the embeddings of all data onto a single point. Researchers predominately solve this problem by using triplet mining strategies. While hard negative mining is the most effective of these strategies, existing formulations lack strong theoretical justification for their empirical success. In this paper, we utilize the mathematical theory of isometric approximation to show an equivalence between the triplet loss sampled by hard negative mining and an optimization problem that minimizes a Hausdorff-like distance between the neural network and its ideal counterpart function. This provides the theoretical justifications for hard negative mining's empirical efficacy. Experiments performed on the Market-1501 and Stanford Online Products datasets with various network architectures corroborate our theoretical findings, indicating that network collapse tends to happen when batch size is too large or embedding dimension is too small. In addition, our novel application of the isometric approximation theorem provides the groundwork for future forms of hard negative mining that avoid network collapse.},

This paper proposes an efficient tool to audit the LLM's adversarial robustness via a prompt-based adversarial attack (PromptAttack). PromptAttack converts adversarial textual attacks into an attack prompt that can cause the victim LLM to output the adversarial sample to fool itself. The attack prompt is composed of three important components: (1) original input (OI) including the original sample and its ground-truth label, (2) attack objective (AO) illustrating a task description of generating a new sample that can fool itself without changing the semantic meaning, and (3) attack guidance (AG) containing the perturbation instructions to guide the LLM on how to complete the task by perturbing the original sample at character, word, and sentence levels, respectively. Besides, we use a fidelity filter to ensure that PromptAttack maintains the original semantic meanings of the adversarial examples. Further, we enhance the attack power of PromptAttack by ensembling adversarial examples at different perturbation levels. Comprehensive empirical results using Llama2 and GPT-3.5 validate that PromptAttack consistently yields a much higher attack success rate compared to AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++. Interesting findings include that a simple emoji can easily mislead GPT-3.5 to make wrong predictions.},

In the time-series domain, positive pair creation is especially difficult due to less obvious invariances compared to computer vision. We propose REBAR (Retrieval-Based Reconstruction), which measures the similarity between two sequences as the reconstruction error that results from reconstructing one sequence with retrieved information from the other. If the two sequences have high REBAR similarity, they are labeled as a positive pair. The REBAR error serves as a predictor of mutual class membership.

@inproceedings{xu2024energybased,
  abstract = {Existing methods, such as concept bottleneck models (CBMs), have been successful in providing concept-based interpretations for black-box deep learning models. They typically work by predicting concepts given the input and then predicting the final class label given the predicted concepts. However, (1) they often fail to capture the high-order, nonlinear interaction between concepts, e.g., correcting a predicted concept (e.g., "yellow breast") does not help correct highly correlated concepts (e.g., "yellow belly"), leading to suboptimal final accuracy; (2) they cannot naturally quantify the complex conditional dependencies between different concepts and class labels (e.g., for an image with the class label "Kentucky Warbler" and a concept "black bill", what is the probability that the model correctly predicts another concept "black crown"), therefore failing to provide deeper insight into how a black-box model works. In response to these limitations, we propose Energy-based Concept Bottleneck Models (ECBMs). Our ECBMs use a set of neural networks to define the joint energy of candidate (input, concept, class) tuples. With such a unified interface, prediction, concept correction, and conditional dependency quantification are then represented as conditional probabilities, which are generated by composing different energy functions. Our ECBMs address both limitations of existing CBMs, providing higher accuracy and richer concept interpretations. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on real-world datasets.},

  abstract = {Retrieving documents and prepending them in-context at inference time improves performance of language models (LMs) on a wide range of tasks. However, these documents, often spanning hundreds of words, make inference substantially more expensive. We propose compressing the retrieved documents into textual summaries prior to in-context integration. This not only reduces the computational costs but also relieves the burden of LMs to identify relevant information in long retrieved documents. We present two compressors -- an extractive compressor which selects useful sentences from retrieved documents and an abstractive compressor which generates summaries by synthesizing information from multiple documents. Both compressors are trained to improve LMs' performance on end tasks when the generated summaries are prepended to the LMs' input, while keeping the summary concise. If the retrieved documents are irrelevant to the input or offer no additional information to LM, our compressor can return an empty string, implementing selective augmentation. We evaluate our approach on language modeling task and open domain question answering task. We achieve a compression rate of as low as 6% with minimal loss in performance for both tasks, significantly outperforming the off-the-shelf summarization models. We show that our compressors trained for one LM can transfer to other LMs on the language modeling task and provide summaries largely faithful to the retrieved documents.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various tasks, such as text summarization, text question-answering, and etc. While their performance is impressive, the computational footprint due to their vast number of parameters can be prohibitive. Existing solutions such as SparseGPT and Wanda attempt to alleviate this issue through weight pruning. However, their layer-wise approach results in significant perturbation to the model's output and requires meticulous hyperparameter tuning, such as the pruning rate, which can adversely affect overall model performance. To address this, this paper introduces a novel LLM pruning technique dubbed blockwise parameter-efficient sparsity allocation (BESA) by applying a blockwise reconstruction loss. In contrast to the typical layer-wise pruning techniques, BESA is characterized by two distinctive attributes: i) it targets the overall pruning error with respect to individual transformer blocks, and ii) it allocates layer-specific sparsity in a differentiable manner, both of which ensure reduced performance degradation after pruning. Our experiments show that BESA achieves state-of-the-art performance, efficiently pruning LLMs like LLaMA1, and LLaMA2 with 7B to 70B parameters on a single A100 GPU in just five hours. Code is available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/LLMPrune-BESA.},

@inproceedings{xu2024boundary,
  abstract = {Video activity localization aims at understanding the semantic content in long untrimmed videos and retrieving actions of interest. The retrieved action with its start and end locations can be used for highlight generation, temporal action detection, etc. Unfortunately, learning the exact boundary location of activities is highly challenging because temporal activities are continuous in time, and there are often no clear-cut transitions between actions. Moreover, the definition of the start and end of events is subjective, which may confuse the model. To alleviate the boundary ambiguity, we propose to study the video activity localization problem from a denoising perspective. Specifically, we propose an encoder-decoder model named DenoiseLoc. During training, a set of action spans is randomly generated from the ground truth with a controlled noise scale. Then we attempt to reverse this process by boundary denoising, allowing the localizer to predict activities with precise boundaries and resulting in faster convergence speed. Experiments show that DenoiseLoc advances in several video activity understanding tasks. For example, we observe a gain of +12.36% average mAP on QV-Highlights dataset and +1.64% mAP@0.5 on THUMOS'14 dataset over the baseline. Moreover, DenoiseLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance on TACoS and MAD datasets, but with much fewer predictions compared to other current methods.},

Despite the tremendous success of foundation models, effective adaptation to new tasks, particularly those with limited labels, remains an open question and lacks theoretical understanding. An emerging solution with recent success in vision and NLP involves finetuning a foundation model on a selection of relevant tasks, before its adaptation to a target task with limited labeled samples. Our theoretical analysis reveals that with a diverse set of related tasks, this multitask finetuning leads to reduced error in the target task, in comparison to directly adapting the same pretrained model. We quantify the relationship between finetuning tasks and target tasks by diversity and consistency metrics, and further propose a practical task selection algorithm. We substantiate our theoretical claims with extensive empirical evidence. Further, we present results affirming our task selection algorithm adeptly chooses related finetuning tasks, providing advantages to the model performance on target tasks. We believe our study shed new light on the effective adaptation of foundation models to new tasks that lack abundant labels.},

The evolution from language chat models to functional language agents demands that models not only master human interaction, reasoning, and planning but also ensure grounding in the relevant environments. This calls for a harmonious blend of language and coding capabilities in the models. Lemur and Lemur-Chat are proposed to address this necessity, demonstrating balanced proficiencies in both domains, unlike existing open-source models that tend to specialize in either. Through meticulous pretraining using a code-intensive corpus and instruction fine-tuning on text and code data, our models achieve state-of-the-art averaged performance across diverse text and coding benchmarks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate Lemur's superiority over existing open-source models and its proficiency across various agent tasks involving human communication, tool usage, and interaction under fully- and partially- observable environments. The harmonization between natural and programming languages enables Lemur-Chat to significantly narrow the gap with proprietary models on agent abilities, providing key insights into developing advanced open-source agents adept at reasoning, planning, and operating seamlessly across environments.

However, manually creating such instruction data is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, humans may struggle to produce high-complexity instructions. In this paper, we show an avenue for creating large amounts of instruction data with varying levels of complexity using LLM instead of humans. Starting with an initial set of instructions, we use our proposed Evol-Instruct to rewrite them step by step into more complex instructions. Then, we mix all generated instruction data to fine-tune LLaMA. We call the resulting model WizardLM. Human evaluations on a complexity-balanced test bed and Vicuna's testset show that instructions from Evol-Instruct are superior to human-created ones. By analyzing the human evaluation results of the high complexity part, we demonstrate that outputs from our WizardLM are preferred to outputs from OpenAI ChatGPT. In GPT-4 automatic evaluation, WizardLM achieves more than 90\% capacity of ChatGPT on 17 out of 29 skills. Even though WizardLM still lags behind ChatGPT in some aspects, our findings suggest that fine-tuning with AI-evolved instructions is a promising direction for enhancing LLMs.},

@inproceedings{xu2024benign,
  abstract = {Neural networks trained by gradient descent (GD) have exhibited a number of surprising generalization behaviors. First, they can achieve a perfect fit to noisy training data and still generalize near-optimally, showing that overfitting can sometimes be benign. Second, they can undergo a period of classical, harmful overfitting -- achieving a perfect fit to training data with near-random performance on test data -- before transitioning (``grokking'') to near-optimal generalization later in training. In this work, we show that both of these phenomena provably occur in two-layer ReLU networks trained by GD on XOR cluster data where a constant fraction of the training labels are flipped. In this setting, we show that after the first step of GD, the network achieves 100\% training accuracy, perfectly fitting the noisy labels in the training data, but achieves near-random test accuracy. At a later training step, the network achieves near-optimal test accuracy while still fitting the random labels in the training data, exhibiting a ``grokking'' phenomenon. This provides the first theoretical result of benign overfitting in neural network classification when the data distribution is not linearly separable. Our proofs rely on analyzing the feature learning process under GD, which reveals that the network implements a non-generalizable linear classifier after one step and gradually learns generalizable features in later steps.},

Despite the strong ability in many language-understanding tasks, the heavy computational burden largely restricts the application of LLMs especially when one needs to deploy them onto edge devices. In this paper, we propose a quantization-aware low-rank adaptation (QA-LoRA) algorithm. The motivation lies in the imbalanced degrees of freedom of quantization and adaptation, and the solution is to use group-wise operators which increase the degree of freedom of quantization meanwhile decreasing that of adaptation. QA-LoRA is easily implemented with a few lines of code, and it equips the original LoRA with two-fold abilities: (i) during fine-tuning, the LLM's weights are quantized (e.g., into INT4) to reduce time and memory usage; (ii) after fine-tuning, the LLM and auxiliary weights are naturally integrated into a quantized model without loss of accuracy.},

However, while recent advancements in MTRL theory have focused on the improved statistical efficiency by assuming a shared structure across tasks, exploration--a crucial aspect of RL--has been largely overlooked. This paper addresses this gap by showing that when an agent is trained on a sufficiently diverse set of tasks, a generic policy-sharing algorithm with myopic exploration design like ε-greedy that are inefficient in general can be sample-efficient for MTRL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical demonstration of the "exploration benefits" of MTRL. It may also shed light on the enigmatic success of the wide applications of myopic exploration in practice. To validate the role of diversity, we conduct experiments on synthetic robotic control environments, where the diverse task set aligns with the task selection by automatic curriculum learning, which is empirically shown to improve sample-efficiency.},

Our codec is theoretically equivalent to conditional generative codec, and it does not require training new models. Instead, it only requires a pre-trained mean-square-error codec and unconditional generative model.

Despite its progress, current algorithms are still unsatisfactory in virtually every aspect of the performance such as sample efficiency, asymptotic performance, and their robustness to the choice of random seeds. In this paper, we identify a major shortcoming in existing visual {RL} methods that is the agents often exhibit sustained inactivity during early training, thereby limiting their ability to explore effectively. Expanding upon this crucial observation, we additionally unveil a significant correlation between the agents' inclination towards motorically inactive exploration and the absence of neuronal activity within their policy networks. To quantify this inactivity, we adopt dormant ratio as a metric to measure inactivity in the {RL} agent's network. Based on this understanding, we propose {DrM} (Dormant ratio Minimized), a method that uses an auxiliary loss to encourage neurons to remain active, which directly addresses the problem of inactive exploration in visual {RL}. Experiments show that {DrM} significantly improves the sample efficiency and asymptotic performance of existing methods across a wide range of visual control tasks.},

The pre-projection representations are not directly optimized by the loss function, raising the question: what makes them better? In this work, we provide a rigorous theoretical answer to this question. We start by examining linear models trained with self-supervised contrastive loss. We reveal that the implicit bias of training algorithms leads to layer-wise progressive feature weighting, where features become increasingly unequal as we go deeper into the layers. Based on this analysis, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that using a projection head can mitigate this bias, leading to more balanced feature learning and improved generalization.

Despite the empirical success, the mechanism behind learning such generalizable representations is not understood. In this work, we rigorously analyze this problem and uncover two mechanisms behind {MMCL}'s robustness: intra-class contrasting, which allows the model to learn features with a high variance, and inter-class feature sharing, where annotated details in one class help learning other classes better. Both mechanisms prevent spurious features that are over-represented in the training data to overshadow the generalizable core features. This yields superior zero-shot classification accuracy under distribution shift. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate the benefits of using rich captions on robustness and explore the effect of annotating different types of details in the captions. We validate our theoretical findings through experiments, including a well-designed synthetic experiment and an experiment involving training {CLIP} models on {MSCOCO}/Conceptual Captions and evaluating them on shifted {ImageNet}s.},

  abstract = {While generative diffusion models excel in producing high-quality images, they can also be misused to mimic authorized images, posing a significant threat to {AI} systems. Efforts have been made to add calibrated perturbations to protect images from diffusion-based mimicry pipelines. However, most of the existing methods are too ineffective and even impractical to be used by individual users due to their high computation and memory requirements. In this work, we present novel findings on attacking latent diffusion models ({LDM}) and propose new plug-and-play strategies for more effective protection. In particular, we explore the bottleneck in attacking an {LDM}, discovering that the encoder module rather than the denoiser module is the vulnerable point. Based on this insight, we present our strategy using Score Distillation Sampling ({SDS}) to double the speed of protection and reduce memory occupation by half without compromising its strength. Additionally, we provide a robust protection strategy by counterintuitively minimizing the semantic loss, which can assist in generating more natural perturbations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to substantiate our findings and comprehensively evaluate our newly proposed strategies.

  abstract = {Metagenomics studies genomic material derived from mixed microbial communities in diverse environments, holding considerable significance for both human health and environmental sustainability. Metagenomic binning refers to the clustering of genomic subsequences obtained from high-throughput {DNA} sequencing into distinct bins, each representing a constituent organism within the community. Mainstream binning methods primarily rely on sequence features such as composition and abundance, making them unable to effectively handle sequences shorter than 1,000 bp and inherent noise within sequences. Several binning tools have emerged, aiming to enhance binning outcomes by using the assembly graph generated by assemblers, which encodes valuable overlapping information among genomic sequences. However, existing assembly graph-based binners mainly focus on simplified contig-level assembly graphs that are recreated from assembler's original graphs, unitig-level assembly graphs. The simplification reduces the resolution of the connectivity information in original graphs. In this paper, we design a novel binning tool named {UnitigBin}, which leverages representation learning on unitig-level assembly graphs while adhering to heterophilous constraints imposed by single-copy marker genes, ensuring that constrained contigs cannot be grouped together. Our approach significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple datasets and metrics.},

To model such data, temporal point processes ({TPPs}) have emerged as the most natural and competitive models, making a significant impact in both academic and application communities. Despite the emergence of many powerful models in recent years, there hasn't been a central benchmark for these models and future research endeavors. This lack of standardization impedes researchers and practitioners from comparing methods and reproducing results, potentially slowing down progress in this field. In this paper, we present {EasyTPP}, the first central repository of research assets (e.g., data, models, evaluation programs, documentations) in the area of event sequence modeling. Our {EasyTPP} makes several unique contributions to this area: a unified interface of using existing datasets and adding new datasets; a wide range of evaluation programs that are easy to use and extend as well as facilitate reproducible research; implementations of popular neural {TPPs}, together with a rich library of modules by composing which one could quickly build complex models. Our benchmark will help promote reproducible research in this field, thus accelerating research progress as well as making more significant real-world impacts.},

It can be used to interpret deep neural networks by locating saliency areas contributing the most to their predictions. However, it is difficult to automatically measure and evaluate the performance of SRV methods due to the lack of ground-truth salience areas of samples. To tackle this problem, researchers have proposed backdoor-based approaches by injecting backdoors into DNNs and using triggered samples as ground-truth. However, in this paper, we first reveal the unreliable nature and implementation limitations of existing backdoor-based SRV evaluation methods, based on which we propose a generalization-limited backdoor watermark (GLBW) and design a more faithful XAI evaluation.},

While CUR-based approaches can be more accurate than the DE-based approach, they require a prohibitively large number of CE calls to compute item embeddings, thus making it impractical for deployment at scale.

VWA is a novel multi-scale learner that leverages local window attention (LWA) and disentangles it into query window and context window, making the scale of context vary for learning representations at multiple scales. Considering that varying context to large-scale windows will increase memory and computation costs (R² times larger than LWA), we propose a re-scaling strategy to eliminate the extra cost without compromising the multi-scale performance.

One typical scenario is that only one or two layers of HGNNs can achieve good results and more layers lead to degeneration of performance. Under such circumstances, it is important to increase the controllability of HGNNs. To tackle the issue, we introduce hypergraph dynamic systems (HDS), which bridge hypergraphs and dynamic systems and characterize the continuous dynamics of representations. We propose a control-diffusion hypergraph dynamic system by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) and design a multi-layer HDS as a neural implementation, which contains control steps and diffusion steps.},

However, adversarial examples are able to manipulate conformal methods to construct prediction sets with invalid coverage rates, as the i.i.d. assumption is violated. To address this issue, previous work proposed Randomized Smoothed Conformal Prediction (RSCP) to certify the robustness of conformal prediction methods to adversarial noise. However, RSCP has two major limitations: (i) its robustness guarantee is flawed when used in practice and (ii) it tends to produce large uncertainty sets. In this work, we first propose a novel framework called RSCP+ to provide provable robustness guarantee in evaluation, which fixes the issues in the original RSCP method. We then propose two novel methods, Post-Training Transformation (PTT) and Robust Conformal Training (RCT), to effectively reduce prediction set size with little computation overhead.},

Different from the popular practice of predicting 2D features first and then obtaining 3D features through dimensionality lifting, our approach directly uses a 3D network for feature extraction. We train the 3D feature extraction network with the help of the novel 2D knowledge transfer loss, which enforces the 2D projections of the 3D feature to be consistent with the output of pre-trained 2D networks. To prevent the feature from discarding 3D signals, we introduce the multi-view consistency loss that additionally encourages the projected 2D feature representations to capture pixel-wise correspondences across different views.

Unlike MAEs used in the image domain, where the pretext task is to restore features at the masked pixels, such as colors, the existing 3D MAE works reconstruct the missing geometry only, i.e, the location of the masked points. In contrast to previous studies, we advocate that point location recovery is inessential and restoring intrinsic point features is much superior. To this end, we propose to ignore point position reconstruction and recover high-order features at masked points including surface normals and surface variations, through a novel attention-based decoder which is independent of the encoder design. We validate the effectiveness of our pretext task and decoder design using different encoder structures for 3D training and demonstrate the advantages of our pretrained networks on various point cloud analysis tasks.},

However, due to the heterogeneity among tables, such DNN bonus is still far from being well exploited on tabular data prediction (e.g., regression or classification tasks). Language models possess the capability to comprehend feature names from various tables, potentially serving as versatile learners in transferring knowledge across distinct tables and diverse prediction tasks, but their discrete text representation space is inherently incompatible with numerical feature values in tables. In this work, we present TP-BERTa, a specifically pre-trained LM for tabular data prediction. We identify three key challenges: (1) the numerical tokenization for capturing the magnitude and precision of numerical values; (2) the intra-feature attention for information fusion within individual features; and (3) the inter-feature attention for information fusion across distinct features. To address these challenges, we propose a relative magnitude tokenization method to enhance the model's perception of numerical values and an intra-feature attention mechanism to exploit feature context. Comprehensive evaluation on extensive downstream datasets shows that TP-BERTa consistently outperforms existing tabular deep learning models and achieves competitive performance with gradient boosting decision trees.},

We provide theoretical analysis showing that the diversity and separatability of learned skills are fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not necessarily guarantee them. To improve MISL, we propose a novel disentanglement metric called LSEPIN and build an information-geometric connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. This leads to a novel skill-learning objective called WSEP. The WSEP objective is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than MISL.

In this work, we propose DNA-GPT, a novel training-free detection strategy based on divergent N-gram analysis. Our method first truncates a text in the middle and then uses only the preceding portion as input to the LLMs to regenerate the new remaining parts. By analyzing the differences between the original and new remaining parts through N-gram analysis in black-box or probability divergence in white-box, we can illustrate significant discrepancies between machine-generated and human-written text. We conducted extensive experiments on advanced LLMs from OpenAI, including text-davinci-003, GPT-3.5-turbo, and GPT-4, as well as open-source models such as GPT-NeoX-20B and LLaMa-13B. Results show that our zero-shot approach exhibits state-of-the-art performance in distinguishing between human and GPT-generated text on four English and one German dataset, outperforming OpenAI's own classifier.},

@inproceedings{yang2024testtime,
  abstract = {Existing test-time adaptation methods mainly concentrate on uni-modal tasks, overlooking the complexity of multi-modal scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a new challenge called reliability bias, which refers to information discrepancies across different modalities derived from intra-modal distribution shifts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method called READ (REliable fusion and robust ADaptation). READ employs a new paradigm that modulates the attention between modalities in a self-adaptive way, supporting reliable fusion against reliability bias. It also adopts a novel objective function for robust multi-modal adaptation, where confident predictions are amplified and negative impacts of noisy predictions are mitigated. We introduce two new benchmarks to facilitate comprehensive evaluations of multi-modal TTA under reliability bias.},

A natural next question is whether these models can advance science, for example by generating novel stable materials. However, generative models for materials have faced significant challenges due to the complex multi-constraint nature of the problem, where generated materials must satisfy strict constraints like thermodynamic stability. In this work, we show how to scale up diffusion models on a novel unified representation of crystal structures that can generate orders of magnitude more novel stable materials compared to previous generative modeling approaches. Our model is trained on a comprehensive dataset and evaluated using metrics that directly assess the ability to generate novel and stable materials verified by Density Functional Theory calculations.},

  abstract = {Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have garnered popularity for data generation across various domains. However, a significant bottleneck is the necessity for whole-network computation during every step of the generative process, leading to high computational overheads. This paper presents a novel framework, Denoising Diffusion Step-aware Models (DDSM), to address this challenge. Unlike conventional approaches, DDSM employs a spectrum of neural networks whose sizes are adapted according to the importance of each generative step, as determined through evolutionary search. This step-wise network variation effectively circumvents redundant computational efforts, particularly in less critical steps, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the diffusion model. Furthermore, the step-aware design can be seamlessly integrated with other efficiency-geared diffusion models such as DDIMs and latent diffusion, thus broadening the scope of computational savings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DDSM achieves computational savings of 49\% for CIFAR-10, 61\% for CelebA-HQ, 59\% for LSUN-bedroom, 71\% for AFHQ, and 76\% for ImageNet, all without compromising the generation quality.},

  abstract = {Generative models trained on internet data have revolutionized how text, image, and video content can be created. Perhaps the next milestone for generative models is to simulate realistic experience in response to actions taken by humans, robots, and other interactive agents. Applications of a real-world simulator range from controllable content creation in games and movies, to training embodied agents purely in simulation that can be directly deployed in the real world. We explore the possibility of learning a universal simulator (UniSim) of real-world interaction through generative modeling. With careful orchestration of diverse datasets, each providing a different aspect of the overall experience, UniSim can emulate how humans and agents interact with the world by simulating the visual outcome of both high-level instructions such as ``open the drawer'' and low-level controls such as ``move by x,y'' from otherwise static scenes and objects. There are numerous use cases for such a real-world simulator. As an example, we use UniSim to train both high-level vision-language planners and low-level reinforcement learning policies, each of which exhibit zero-shot real-world transfer after training purely in a learned real-world simulator. We also show that other types of intelligence such as video captioning models can benefit from training with simulated experience in UniSim, opening up even wider applications.},

Instead of exclusively following one of them, we propose MixSup, a more practical paradigm simultaneously utilizing massive cheap coarse labels and a limited number of accurate labels for Mixed-grained Supervision. We start by observing that point clouds are usually textureless, making it hard to learn semantics. However, point clouds are geometrically rich and scale-invariant to the distances from sensors, making it relatively easy to learn the geometry of objects, such as poses and shapes. Thus, MixSup leverages massive coarse cluster-level labels to learn semantics and a few expensive box-level labels to learn accurate poses and shapes. To reduce the annotation burden, we also propose PointSAM based on Segment Anything Model for automated coarse labeling. Extensive experiments on nuScenes, Waymo Open Dataset, and KITTI with various detectors demonstrate that MixSup achieves up to 97.31\% of fully supervised performance using cheap cluster annotations and only 10\% box annotations.},

However, the rationality of the diffusion process itself receives limited attention, leaving the question of whether the problem is well-posed and well-conditioned. In this work, we explore a perplexing tendency of diffusion models: they often display infinite Lipschitz constants of the network with respect to the time variable near the zero point. We provide theoretical proofs to illustrate the presence of infinite Lipschitz constants and present empirical results confirming this observation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, dubbed E-TSDM (Eliminating Time Singularities in Diffusion Models), which alleviates the Lipschitz singularities of the diffusion model near the zero point of timesteps. As a byproduct of our method, we achieve a dramatic reduction in the Fréchet Inception Distance of acceleration methods relying on network Lipschitz, including DDIM and DPM-Solver, by over 33\%.},

This decomposition emerges purely from self-supervision, enabling our model to learn from general, in-the-wild data sources. EmerNeRF parameterizes an induced flow field from the dynamic field and uses this flow field to further aggregate multi-frame features, amplifying the rendering precision of dynamic objects.

Using two different prompts causes model outputs to be more differentiated on average, resulting in cleaner preference labels in the absence of human annotations. We then train a preference model on the resulting pairs, which is used to guide the LLM alignment via PPO. Empirically, RLCD outperforms RLAIF and context distillation methods for harmlessness and helpfulness alignment on LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-30B models.

A data-centric solution is oversampling where classes are balanced by adding synthetic minority samples via generative methods. Although tabular generative models can generate synthetic samples under a balanced distribution, their integrity suffers when the number of minority samples is low. Pre-trained generative language models with rich prior knowledge are fitting candidates for this task. We leverage their conditional sampling capabilities to synthesize minority samples by progressively masking important features of majority class samples and imputing them towards the minority distribution. We utilize the power of the language model to self-authenticate the labels of generated samples, filtering out ill-converted samples. Extensive experiments on various datasets and imbalance ratios reveal that our proposed method successfully generates reliable minority samples to boost classifier performance, even under heavy imbalance ratios.},

However, in real-world scenarios, the absence of target-domain labels makes it challenging to evaluate the performance of UDA models. Furthermore, prevailing UDA methods relying on adversarial training and self-training could lead to model degeneration and negative transfer, further exacerbating the evaluation problem. In this paper, we propose a novel metric called the Transfer Score to address these issues. The proposed metric enables the unsupervised evaluation of UDA models by assessing the spatial uniformity of the classifier via model parameters, as well as the transferability and discriminability of deep representations. Based on the metric, we achieve three novel objectives without target-domain labels: (1) selecting the best UDA method from a range of available options, (2) optimizing hyperparameters of UDA models to prevent model degeneration, and (3) avoiding negative transfer by providing an early stopping criterion during adaptation.},

However, even in the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) case, existing {BRDL} methods will suffer a significant drop on model accuracy due to the large variance of stochastic gradients. Increasing batch sizes is a simple yet effective way to reduce the variance. However, when the total number of gradient computation is fixed, a too-large batch size will lead to a too-small iteration number (update number), which may also degrade the model accuracy. In view of this challenge, we mainly study the effect of batch size when the total number of gradient computation is fixed in this work. In particular, we theoretically and empirically show that when the total number of gradient computation is fixed, the optimal batch size in {BRDL} increases with the fraction of {Byzantine} workers. Therefore, compared to the case without attacks, the batch size should be set larger when under {Byzantine} attacks.},

A recent development known as task arithmetic has revealed that several models, each fine-tuned for distinct tasks, can be directly merged into a single model to execute {MTL} without necessitating a retraining process using the initial training data. Nevertheless, this direct addition of models often leads to a significant deterioration in the overall performance of the merged model. This decline occurs due to potential conflicts and intricate correlations among the multiple tasks. This paper introduces an innovative technique called {Adaptive Model Merging} ({AdaMerging}). This approach aims to autonomously learn the coefficients for model merging, either in a task-wise or layer-wise manner, without relying on the original training data. Specifically, our {AdaMerging} method operates as an automatic, unsupervised task arithmetic scheme. It leverages entropy minimization on unlabeled test samples from the multi-task setup as a surrogate objective function to iteratively refine the merging coefficients of the multiple models.},

  abstract = {The advancements in large language models ({LLMs}) have ignited interest in domain-specific large models for tabular data in data science applications, yet existing methods have notable limitations. In this paper, we aim to design a tabular language model for universal tabular understanding. We begin by analyzing the inherent properties of tabular data, identifying three key challenges: {1}) table is a composite of multiple information including meta information and cell entities, {2}) tabular cells are highly heterogeneous and lack standardized structure, and {3}) cell entities are closely related through implicit table structures. To tackle these challenges, we design a straightforward yet effective method to process tables in a uniform manner, devoid of constraints imposed by specific table structures. Our proposed method, termed as {UniTabE}, is a universal pretraining protocol for tabular foundation model in data science. The core idea of {UniTabE} is to represent each basic table element with a module, termed {TabUnit}, followed by a {Transformer} encoder to refine the representation. We pretrain {UniTabE} on an expansive tabular dataset comprising approximately 13 billion samples, meticulously gathered from the {Kaggle} platform.},

  abstract = {Offline reinforcement learning ({RL}) aims to derive effective policies from historical datasets without further interaction with the environment. Recent progress has shown that the incorporation of diffusion models can significantly boost the performance of offline {RL} algorithms. However, offline methods can be overly conservative or fail to generate optimal actions in perturbed states unobserved during training. This becomes particularly severe for state-based {RL} when the testing environment has perturbed state observations. In this work, we propose {DMBP}, a novel framework that recovers the actual states with conditional diffusion models for state-based {RL} tasks, and derive robust policies to handle the perturbations. To mitigate the error accumulation issue in model-based estimation, we propose a non-{Markovian} training objective to minimize the sum entropy of denoised states in {RL} trajectory. Experiments on standard benchmark problems demonstrate that {DMBP} can significantly enhance the robustness of existing offline {RL} algorithms against different scales of random noises and adversarial attacks on state observations.},

Despite advancements in neural implicit models, limitations persist: (i) Inadequate Scene Structure: Existing methods struggle to reveal the spatial and temporal structure of dynamic scenes from directly learning the complex 6D plenoptic function. (ii) Scaling Deformation Modeling: Explicitly modeling scene element deformation becomes impractical for complex dynamics. To address these issues, we consider the spacetime as an entirety and propose to approximate the underlying spatio-temporal 4D volume of a dynamic scene by optimizing a collection of 4D primitives, with explicit geometry and appearance modeling. Our model is conceptually simple, consisting of a 4D Gaussian parameterized by anisotropic ellipses that can rotate arbitrarily in space and time, as well as view-dependent and time-evolved appearance represented by the coefficient of 4D spherindrical harmonics. This approach offers simplicity, flexibility for variable-length video and end-to-end training, and efficient real-time rendering, making it suitable for capturing complex dynamic scene motions.},

The embeddings of two images may lie on distinct conditioned distributions of a latent diffusion model, especially when they have significant semantic difference. To bridge this gap, we interpolate in the locally linear and continuous text embedding space and Gaussian latent space. We first optimize the endpoint text embeddings and then map the images to the latent space using a probability flow ODE. Unlike existing work that takes an indirect morphing path, we show that the model adaptation yields a direct path and suppresses ghosting artifacts in the interpolated images. To achieve this, we propose a heuristic bottleneck constraint based on a novel relative perceptual path diversity score that automatically controls the bottleneck size and balances the diversity along the path with its directness. We also propose a perceptually-uniform sampling technique that enables visually smooth changes between the interpolated images. Extensive experiments validate that our IMPUS can achieve smooth, direct, and realistic image morphing and is adaptable to several other generative tasks.},

Here we investigate the analogous classification for depthwise parametrizations of deep residual networks (ResNets). We classify depthwise parametrizations of block multiplier and learning rate by their infinite-width-then-depth limits. In ResNets where each block has only one layer, we identify a unique optimal parametrization, called Depth-μP that extends μP and show empirically it admits depthwise hyperparameter transfer. However, if each block is deeper (such as modern transformers), then we find fundamental limitations in all possible infinite-depth limits of such parametrizations. We demonstrate this both theoretically and empirically on networks including the Megatron Transformer. This work introduces Depth-μP, a principled approach for depth scaling that allows for training arbitrarily deep networks while maximizing feature learning and feature diversity.},

To estimate the client utility, we propose a Bayesian framework that models client utility and its relationships with the weight parameters and the performance of local models. We then introduce a variational inference algorithm to effectively infer client utility, given only a small amount of auxiliary data.

We consider motion as an important cue for identifying parts, that all particles on the same part share the common motion pattern. From the perspective of fluid simulation, existing deformation-based methods for dynamic NeRF can be seen as parameterizing the scene motion under the Eulerian view, i.e., focusing on specific locations in space through which the fluid flows as time passes. However, it is intractable to extract the motion of constituting objects or parts using the Eulerian view representation. In this work, we introduce the dual Lagrangian view and enforce representations under the Eulerian/Lagrangian views to be cycle-consistent. Under the Lagrangian view, we parameterize the scene motion by tracking the trajectory of particles on objects. The Lagrangian view makes it convenient to discover parts by factorizing the scene motion as a composition of part-level rigid motions.},

Earlier works focused on new-class detection, aiming to identify label-altering data distribution shifts, also known as 'semantic shift.' However, recent works argue for a focus on failure detection, expanding the OOD evaluation framework to account for label-preserving data distribution shifts, also known as 'covariate shift.' Intriguingly, under this new framework, complex OOD detectors that were previously considered state-of-the-art now perform similarly to, or even worse than the simple maximum softmax probability baseline. This raises the question: what are the latest OOD detectors actually detecting? Deciphering the behavior of OOD detection algorithms requires evaluation datasets that decouples semantic shift and covariate shift. To aid our investigations, we present ImageNet-OOD, a clean semantic shift dataset that minimizes the interference of covariate shift. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that OOD detectors are more sensitive to covariate shift than to semantic shift, and the benefits of recent OOD detection algorithms on semantic shift detection is minimal. Our dataset and analyses provide important insights for guiding the design of future OOD detectors.},

In this work, we propose a general Transformer-based SNN architecture, termed as "Meta-SpikeFormer", whose goals are: 1) Lower-power, supports the spike-driven paradigm that there is only sparse addition in the network; 2) Versatility, handles various vision tasks; 3) High-performance, shows overwhelming performance advantages over CNN-based SNNs; 4) Meta-architecture, provides inspiration for future next-generation Transformer-based neuromorphic chip designs. Specifically, we extend the Spike-driven Transformer and explore the impact of structure, spike-driven self-attention, and skip connection on its performance. On ImageNet-1K, Meta-SpikeFormer achieves 80.0% top-1 accuracy (55M), surpassing the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN baselines (66M) by 3.7%.

@inproceedings{yao2024retroformer,

Most existing language agents, however, are not optimized using environment-specific rewards. Although some agents enable iterative refinement through verbal feedback, they do not reason and plan in ways that are compatible with gradient-based learning from rewards. This paper introduces a principled framework for reinforcing large language agents by learning a retrospective model, which automatically tunes the language agent prompts from environment feedback through policy gradient optimization. Specifically, our proposed method, Retroformer, comprises two language model components: an actor LLM, which generates reasoning thoughts and actions, and a retrospective LLM, which generates verbal reinforcement cues. The Retroformer method focuses on fine-tuning the retrospective model in the language agent system architecture, without accessing the Actor LLM parameters or needing to propagate gradients through it. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on real-world tasks including HotPotQA, AlfWorld, and WebShop.},

This method presents several advantages: it eliminates the need for labeling or retrieving exemplars, offering generality and convenience; it can also tailor the generated exemplars and knowledge to each problem, offering adaptability. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms 0-shot CoT and manual few-shot CoT in a variety of reasoning tasks, including math problem solving in GSM8K and MATH, code generation in Codeforces, and other reasoning tasks in BIG-Bench, with an average accuracy gain of +5%.},

  abstract = {PTaRL proposes a prototype-based tabular representation learning framework for tabular prediction tasks. The motivation stems from existing deep tabular ML methods suffering from representation entanglement and localization, which hinders prediction performance and leads to inconsistency. The core idea of PTaRL is to construct prototype-based projection space (P-Space) and learn disentangled representation around global data prototypes. PTaRL involves two main stages: (i) Prototype Generation, which constructs global prototypes as basis vectors of P-Space, and (ii) Prototype Projection, which projects data samples into P-Space while preserving core global data information via Optimal Transport. The method uses two constraint strategies: (i) a diversification constraint for representation calibration to diversify coordinates towards global prototypes, and (ii) a matrix orthogonalization constraint to ensure independence of global prototypes and avoid entanglement.},

  abstract = {Domain generalization is challenging when training domains have limited coverage of the target domain. Data heterogeneity in federated learning (FL) is a key bottleneck that causes model divergence and limits performance. Instead of treating data heterogeneity as an inherent property and correcting models, we propose generating data to complement the original dataset to fundamentally mitigate heterogeneity level. We introduce federated learning with consensus-oriented generation (FedCOG). FedCOG consists of two key components at the client side: complementary data generation, which generates data extracted from the shared global model to complement the original dataset, and knowledge-distillation-based model training, which distills knowledge from global model to local model based on the generated data to mitigate over-fitting the original heterogeneous dataset. FedCOG has two critical advantages: 1) it can be a plug-and-play module to further improve the performance of most existing FL methods, and 2) it is naturally compatible with standard FL protocols such as Secure Aggregation since it makes no modification in communication process.},

By employing a teacher trained via MCMI estimation rather than one trained via MLL estimation in various state-of-the-art KD frameworks, the student's classification accuracy consistently increases, with the gain of up to 3.32%. The student's accuracy increases with the gain of up to 5.72% when 5% of the training samples are available to the student (few-shot), and increases from 0% to as high as 84% for an omitted class (zero-shot).

However, previous studies have mainly focused on coarse-grained evaluation (i.e. overall preference-based evaluation), which limits interpretability since it does not consider the nature of user instructions that require instance-wise skill composition. In this paper, we introduce FLASK (Fine-grained Language Model Evaluation based on Alignment Skill Sets), a fine-grained evaluation protocol for both human-based and model-based evaluation which decomposes coarse-level scoring to a skill set-level scoring for each instruction. We experimentally observe that the fine-graininess of evaluation is crucial for attaining a holistic view of model performance and increasing the reliability of the evaluation. Using FLASK, we compare multiple open-source and proprietary LLMs and observe a high correlation between model-based and human-based evaluations.},

A prime exemplification is the recently proposed test-time prompt tuning for large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP. Unfortunately, these prompts have been mainly developed to improve accuracy, overlooking the importance of calibration, which is a crucial aspect for quantifying prediction uncertainty. However, traditional calibration methods rely on substantial amounts of labeled data, making them impractical for test-time scenarios. To this end, this paper explores calibration during test-time prompt tuning by leveraging the inherent properties of CLIP. Through a series of observations, we find that the prompt choice significantly affects the calibration in CLIP, where the prompts leading to higher text feature dispersion result in better-calibrated predictions. Introducing the Average Text Feature Dispersion (ATFD), we establish its relationship with calibration error and present a novel method, Calibrated Test-time Prompt Tuning (C-TPT), for optimizing prompts during test-time with enhanced calibration.},

An important desideratum of RALMs, is that retrieved information helps model performance when it is relevant, and does not harm performance when it is not. This is particularly important in multi-hop reasoning scenarios, where misuse of irrelevant evidence can lead to cascading errors. However, recent work has shown that retrieval augmentation can sometimes have a negative effect on performance. In this work, we present a thorough analysis on five open-domain question answering benchmarks, characterizing cases when retrieval reduces accuracy. We propose a method for automatically generating data to fine-tune the language model to properly leverage retrieved passages, using a mix of relevant and irrelevant contexts at training time. We empirically show that even 1,000 examples suffice to train the model to be robust to irrelevant contexts while maintaining high performance on examples with relevant ones.},

We introduce SWAP, a formulation of Entropic Wasserstein regression (EWR) for network pruning, capitalizing on the geometric properties of the optimal transport problem. The "swap" of the commonly used linear regression with the EWR in optimization is analytically demonstrated to offer noise mitigation effects by incorporating neighborhood interpolation across data points with only marginal additional computational cost. The unique strength of SWAP is its intrinsic ability to balance noise reduction and covariance information preservation effectively. Extensive experiments performed on various networks and datasets show comparable performance of SWAP with state-of-the-art (SoTA) network pruning algorithms. Our proposed method outperforms the SoTA when the network size or the target sparsity is large, the gain is even larger with the existence of noisy gradients, possibly from noisy data, analog memory, or adversarial attacks. Notably, our proposed method achieves a gain of 6% improvement in accuracy and 8% improvement in testing loss for MobileNetV1 with less than one-fourth of the network parameters remaining.},

@inproceedings{you2024cobit,
  abstract = {The field of Vision-and-Language (VL) has witnessed a proliferation of pretrained foundation models. Current techniques typically employ only one type of training objective, whether it's (1) contrastive objectives (like CLIP), (2) image-to-text generative objectives (like PaLI), or (3) text-to-image generative objectives (like Parti). However, all these three objectives are mutually relevant and are all based on image-text pairs. Intuitively, the first two objectives can be considered as complementary projections between two modalities, and contrastive learning can preserve global alignment and generations facilitate fine-grained understanding. Inspired by this, we present a Contrastive Bi-directional Image-Text generation model (CoBIT) to first time unify the three pre-training objectives in one framework. Specifically, CoBIT employs a novel unicoder-decoder structure consisting of an image unicoder, a text unicoder, and a cross-modal decoder. The image/text unicoders can switch between encoding and decoding in different tasks, enabling flexibility and shared knowledge that benefits both image-to-text and text-to-image generations. CoBIT achieves superior performance in image understanding, image-text understanding (Retrieval, Captioning, VQA, SNLI-VE), and text-based content creation, particularly in zero-shot scenarios.},

@inproceedings{you2024efficient,
  abstract = {Convolution-BatchNorm (ConvBN) blocks are integral components in various computer vision tasks and other domains. A ConvBN block can operate in three modes: Train, Eval, and Deploy. While the Train mode is indispensable for training models from scratch, the Eval mode is suitable for transfer learning and beyond, and the Deploy mode is designed for the deployment of models. This paper focuses on the trade-off between stability and efficiency in ConvBN blocks: Deploy mode is efficient but suffers from training instability; Eval mode is widely used in transfer learning but lacks efficiency. To solve the dilemma, we theoretically reveal the reason behind the diminished training stability observed in the Deploy mode. Subsequently, we propose a novel Tune mode to bridge the gap between Eval mode and Deploy mode. The proposed Tune mode is as stable as Eval mode for transfer learning, and its computational efficiency closely matches that of the Deploy mode. Through extensive experiments in object detection, classification, and adversarial example generation across 5 datasets and 12 model architectures, we demonstrate that the proposed Tune mode retains the performance while significantly reducing GPU memory footprint and training time, thereby contributing efficient ConvBN blocks for transfer learning and beyond.},

To extract the continuous features of versatile regions, we propose a spatial-aware visual sampler, adept at handling varying sparsity across different shapes. {FERRET} can accept diverse region inputs, such as points, bounding boxes, and free-form shapes. To bolster the desired capability of {FERRET}, we curated {GRIT}, a comprehensive refer-and-ground instruction tuning dataset including 1.1M samples that contain rich hierarchical spatial knowledge, with 95K hard negative data to promote model robustness. The resulting model not only achieves superior performance in classical referring and grounding tasks, but also greatly outperforms existing {MLLMs} in region-based and localization-demanded multimodal chatting. Our evaluations also reveal a significantly improved capability of describing image details and a remarkable alleviation in object hallucination.},

We provide theoretical analysis showing that performance bounds of 3D graph diffusion can be improved in a latent space versus the original space, provided that the latent space has (i) low dimensionality yet (ii) high quality (i.e., low reconstruction error) and {DGMs} have (iii) symmetry preservation as an inductive bias.

In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based method called {ElliDock}, which predicts an elliptic paraboloid to represent the protein-protein docking interface. To be specific, our model estimates elliptic paraboloid interfaces for the two input proteins respectively, and obtains the roto-translation transformation for docking by making two interfaces coincide. By its design, {ElliDock} is independently equivariant with respect to arbitrary rotations/translations of the proteins, which is an indispensable property to ensure the generalization of the docking process. Experimental evaluations show that {ElliDock} achieves the fastest inference time among all compared methods and is strongly competitive with current state-of-the-art learning-based models such as {DiffDock-PP} and {Multimer} particularly for antibody-antigen docking.},

Remarkable achievements have been made in significantly reducing the solving time compared to traditional numerical solvers. These methods are typically designed to i) reduce the computational cost in solving physical dynamics and/or ii) propose techniques to enhance the solution accuracy in fluid and rigid body dynamics. However, it remains under-explored whether they are effective in addressing the challenges of flexible body dynamics, where instantaneous collisions occur. The key challenge stems from the long-range interaction where the collision effect at the contact point should be immediately propagated to the entire object. To tackle this challenge, we present Hierarchical Contact Mesh Transformer ({HCMT}), which enables long-range interactions and the hierarchical mesh structure quickly propagates collision effects to faraway positions. To this end, HCMT consists of a contact mesh Transformer and a hierarchical mesh Transformer ({CMT} and {HMT}, respectively). We propose a flexible body dynamics dataset, consisting of trajectories that reflect experimental settings frequently used in the display industry for product designs. We also compare the performance of several baselines using well-known benchmark datasets. Our results show that {HCMT} provides significant performance improvements over existing methods.},

@inproceedings{yu2024skillmix,
  abstract = {With {LLMs} shifting their role from statistical modeling of language to serving as general-purpose {AI} agents, how should {LLM} evaluations change? Arguably, a key ability of an {AI} agent is to flexibly combine, as needed, the basic skills it has learned. The capability to combine skills plays an important role in (human) pedagogy and also in a paper on emergence phenomena (Arora \& Goyal, 2023). This work introduces {Skill-Mix}, a new evaluation to measure ability to combine skills. Using a list of $N$ skills the evaluator repeatedly picks random subsets of $k$ skills and asks the {LLM} to produce text combining that subset of skills. Since the number of subsets grows like $N^k$, for even modest $k$ this evaluation will, with high probability, require the {LLM} to produce text significantly different from any text in the training set. The paper develops methodology for both designing and administering such evaluations, as well as automatic grading using {GPT-4}. Administering a version of {SKILL-MIX} to popular chatbots gave results that, while generally in line with prior expectations, contained surprises. Sizeable differences exist among model capabilities that are not captured by their ranking on popular {LLM} leaderboards. Furthermore, simple probability calculations indicate that {GPT-4}'s reasonable performance on $k=5$ is suggestive of going beyond ``stochastic parrot'' behavior, i.e., it combines skills in ways that it had not seen during training.},

@inproceedings{yu2024multimodal,
  abstract = {Self-supervised learning has recently gained growing interest in molecular modeling for scientific tasks such as {AI}-assisted drug discovery. Current studies consider leveraging both 2D and 3D molecular structures for representation learning. However, relying on straightforward alignment strategies that treat each modality separately, these methods fail to exploit the intrinsic correlation between 2D and 3D representations that reflect the underlying structural characteristics of molecules, and only perform coarse-grained molecule-level alignment. To derive fine-grained alignment and promote structural molecule understanding, the paper introduces an atomic-relation level ``blend-then-predict'' self-supervised learning approach, {MoleBLEND}, which first blends atom relations represented by different modalities into one unified relation matrix for joint encoding, then recovers modality-specific information. {MoleBLEND} explicitly leverages the alignment of atom relations between 2D and 3D structures and blends input signals from different modalities as one unified data structure to pre-train one single model. {MoleBLEND} consists of a two-stage blend-then-predict training procedure: modality-blended encoding and modality-targeted prediction. During encoding, different depictions of atom relations from 2D and 3D views are blended into one relation matrix. During prediction, the model recovers missing 2D and 3D information as supervision signals. With such a relation-level blending approach, multimodal molecular information is mingled within a unified model, and fine-grained atom-relation alignment in the multimodal input space leads to a deeper structural understanding of molecular makeup. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that {MoleBLEND} achieves state-of-the-art performance over diverse 2D and 3D tasks, verifying the effectiveness of relation-level alignment.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models ({LLMs}) have achieved remarkable success in reasoning tasks with the development of prompting methods. However, existing prompting approaches cannot reuse insights of solving similar problems and suffer from accumulated errors in multi-step reasoning, since they prompt {LLMs} to reason from scratch. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Thought Propagation ({TP})}, which explores the analogous problems and leverages their solutions to enhance the complex reasoning ability of {LLMs}. These analogous problems are related to the input one, with reusable solutions and problem-solving strategies. Thus, it is promising to propagate insights of solving previous analogous problems to inspire new problem-solving. To achieve this, {TP} first prompts {LLMs} to propose and solve a set of analogous problems that are related to the input one. Then, {TP} reuses the results of analogous problems to directly yield a new solution or derive a knowledge-intensive plan for execution to amend the initial solution obtained from scratch. {TP} is compatible with existing prompting approaches, allowing plug-and-play generalization and enhancement in a wide range of tasks without much labor in task-specific prompt engineering. Experiments across three challenging tasks demonstrate {TP} enjoys a substantial improvement over the baselines by an average of 12\% absolute increase in finding the optimal solutions in Shortest-path Reasoning, 13\% improvement of human preference in Creative Writing, and 15\% enhancement in the task completion rate of {LLM}-Agent Planning.},

Protecting the intellectual property ({IP}) and commercial ownership of a deep model is challenging yet increasingly crucial. A major stream of watermarking strategies implants verifiable backdoor triggers by poisoning training samples, but these are often unrealistic due to data privacy and safety concerns and are vulnerable to minor model changes such as fine-tuning. To overcome these challenges, we propose a safe and robust backdoor-based watermark injection technique that leverages the diverse knowledge from a single out-of-distribution ({OoD}) image, which serves as a secret key for {IP} verification. We induce robustness via random perturbation of model parameters during watermark injection to defend against common watermark removal attacks, including fine-tuning, pruning, and model extraction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed watermarking approach is not only time and sample-efficient without training data, but also robust against the watermark removal attacks. The key innovation is using a new method for safely and robustly injecting watermark after training without training data. The independence of training data makes it agnostic to third-party promises of {IP} security.},

While pixel classification in HSI has been extensively studied using graph convolution neural networks (GCNs), quantifying epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties associated with HSI classification results remains an unexplored area. These two uncertainties are effective for out-of-distribution (OOD) and misclassification detection, respectively. In this work, we adapt two advanced uncertainty quantification models, evidential GCNs (EGCN) and graph posterior networks (GPN), designed for node classifications in graphs, into the realm of hyperspectral image classification. We first reveal theoretically that a popular uncertainty cross-entropy (UCE) loss function is insufficient to produce good epistemic uncertainty when learning EGCNs. To mitigate the limitations, we propose two regularization terms. One leverages the inherent property of HSI data where each feature vector is a linear combination of the spectra signatures of confounding materials, while the other is the total variation (TV) regularization to enforce the spatial smoothness of the evidence with edge-preserving. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed regularization terms on both EGCN and GPN on three real-world HSI classification datasets for OOD and misclassification detection tasks.},

We investigate how the dropout rate affects the hypergradient of this model. We propose a dropout bilevel method to solve the dropout bilevel optimization model. Subsequently, we analyze the resulting dropout bilevel method from an optimization perspective. Analyzing the optimization properties of methods with dropout is essential because it provides convergence guarantees for methods using dropout. However, there has been limited investigation in this research direction. We provide the complexity of the resulting dropout bilevel method in terms of reaching an $\epsilon$ stationary point of the proposed stochastic bilevel model. Empirically, we demonstrate that overfitting occurs in data cleaning problems, and the method proposed in this work mitigates this issue.},

  abstract = {Hyperbolic space has proven to be well-suited for capturing hierarchical relations in data, such as trees and directed acyclic graphs. Prior work introduced the concept of entailment cones, which uses partial orders defined by nested cones in the Poincar{\'e} ball to model hierarchies. Here, we introduce the 'shadow cones' framework, a physics-inspired entailment cone construction. Specifically, we model partial orders as subset relations between shadows formed by a light source and opaque objects in hyperbolic space. The shadow cones framework generalizes entailment cones to a broad class of formulations and hyperbolic space models beyond the Poincar{\'e} ball. This results in clear advantages over existing constructions: for example, shadow cones possess better optimization properties over constructions limited to the Poincar{\'e} ball. Our experiments on datasets of various sizes and hierarchical structures show that shadow cones consistently and significantly outperform existing entailment cone constructions. These results indicate that shadow cones are an effective way to model partial orders in hyperbolic space, offering physically intuitive and novel insights about the nature of such structures.},

  abstract = {Video diffusion models have recently made great progress in generation quality, but are still limited by the high memory and computational requirements. This is because current video diffusion models often attempt to process high-dimensional videos directly. To tackle this issue, we propose content-motion latent diffusion model ({CMD}), a novel efficient extension of pretrained image diffusion models for video generation. Specifically, we propose an autoencoder that succinctly encodes a video as a combination of a content frame (like an image) and a low-dimensional motion latent representation. The former represents the common content, and the latter represents the underlying motion in the video, respectively. We generate the content frame by fine-tuning a pretrained image diffusion model, and we generate the motion latent representation by training a new lightweight diffusion model. A key innovation here is the design of a compact latent space that can directly utilizes a pretrained image diffusion model, which has not been done in previous latent video diffusion models. This leads to considerably better quality generation and reduced computational costs. For instance, {CMD} can sample a video 7.7$\times$ faster than prior approaches by generating a video of $512 \times 1024$ resolution and length 16 in 3.1 seconds. Moreover, {CMD} achieves an {FVD} score of 238.3 on WebVid-10M, 18.5\% better than the previous state-of-the-art of 292.4.},

  abstract = {State-space models ({SSMs}) have recently emerged as a framework for learning long-range sequence tasks. An example is the structured state-space sequence ({S4}) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the {HiPPO} initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the {S4} layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as {S4D} and {S5} have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the {HiPPO} framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable 'perturb-then-diagonalize' ({PTD}) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining {SSMs}. Based on this, we introduce the {S4-PTD} and {S5-PTD} models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the {S4-PTD}/{S5-PTD} initialization strongly converges to the {HiPPO} framework, while the {S4D}/{S5} initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the {S4D}/{S5} models. In addition to improved robustness, our {S5-PTD} model averages 87.6\% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating that the {PTD} methodology helps to improve the accuracy of deep learning models.},

  abstract = {Program synthesis aims to create accurate, executable programs from problem specifications, specifically from natural language descriptions in our context. Recent studies have leveraged the power of reinforcement learning ({RL}) in conjunction with large language models ({LLMs}), significantly enhancing code generation capabilities. The application of {RL} focuses on directly optimizing for functional correctness, offering an advantage over conventional supervised methods. Despite policy-based {RL} methods dominating the literature on {RL} for program synthesis, the nature of program synthesis tasks hints at a natural alignment with value-based methods. This stems from the rich collection of off-policy programs, including those developed by human programmers and also historical samples, coupled with the straightforward verification of generated programs through automated unit testing, meaning rewards are easy to obtain. Diverging from the dominant use of policy-based algorithms, our work explores the feasibility of value-based approaches, leading to the development of our $\mathcal{B}$-Coder (pronounced Bellman coder). Yet, training value-based methods presents challenges due to the enormous search space inherent to program synthesis. To this end, we introduce an initialization protocol for {RL} agents utilizing pre-trained {LMs} and a conservative Bellman operator to reduce training complexities. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage the learned value functions as a dual strategy to post-process generated programs. Our empirical evaluations demonstrated $\mathcal{B}$-Coder's capability in achieving state-of-the-art performance when compared to policy-based methods. Remarkably, this achievement is reached with minimal reward engineering effort, highlighting the effectiveness of value-based {RL}, independent of reward designs.},

  abstract = {In observational studies, balancing covariates in different treatment groups is essential to estimate treatment effects. One of the most commonly used methods for such purposes is weighting. The performance of this class of methods usually depends on strong regularity conditions for the underlying model, which might not hold in practice. In this paper, we investigate weighting methods from a functional estimation perspective and argue that the weights needed for covariate balancing could differ from those needed for treatment effects estimation under low regularity conditions. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a new framework of weighting that directly targets the treatment effects estimation. Unlike existing methods, the resulting estimator for a treatment effect under this new framework is a simple kernel-based $U$-statistic after applying a data-driven transformation to the observed covariates. We characterize the theoretical properties of the new estimators of treatment effects under a nonparametric setting and show that they are able to work robustly under low regularity conditions. The new framework is also applied to several numerical examples to demonstrate its practical merits.},

  abstract = {The information bottleneck ({IB}) approach is popular to improve the generalization, robustness and explainability of deep neural networks. Essentially, it aims to find a minimum sufficient representation by striking a trade-off between a compression term and a prediction term, where mutual information is involved. Mutual information is for the {IB} for the most part expressed in terms of the Kullback-Leibler ({KL}) divergence, which in the regression case corresponds to prediction based on mean squared error ({MSE}) loss with {G}aussian assumption and compression approximated by variational inference. In this paper, we study the {IB} principle for the regression problem and develop a new way to parameterize the {IB} with deep neural networks by exploiting favorable properties of the Cauchy-Schwarz ({CS}) divergence. By doing so, we move away from {MSE}-based regression and ease estimation by avoiding variational approximations or distributional assumptions. We demonstrate that the {CS} divergence offers a new prediction term which does not take any distributional assumptions on the decoder, and that the compression term can be explicitly estimated from samples without variational or non-parametric upper bound approximations, by making use of the Cauchy-Schwarz quadratic mutual information ({CS}-{QMI}). We demonstrate strong adversarial robustness guarantees and superior performance on six real-world regression tasks over other popular deep {IB} approaches.},

  abstract = {Early stopping methods in deep learning face the challenge of balancing the volume of training and validation data, especially in the presence of label noise. Concretely, sparing more data for validation from training data would limit the performance of the learned model, yet insufficient validation data could result in a sub-optimal selection of the desired model. To address this issue, we propose a novel early stopping method called Label Wave, which does not require validation data for selecting the desired model in the presence of label noise. Label Wave works by tracking the changes in the model's predictions on the training set during the training process, aiming to halt training before the model unduly fits mislabeled data. This method is empirically supported by our observation that minimum fluctuations in predictions typically occur at the training epoch before the model excessively fits mislabeled data. We introduce two key metrics: a stability metric using the k-epoch learning metric to quantify the stability of the model's predictions for specific subsets of examples, and a variability metric using prediction changes to emphasize the model's inconsistency in classifying training set examples. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing early stopping methods.},

By generating code snippets and executing them through task-specific Application Programming Interfaces ({API}s), they can offload certain functions to dedicated external modules, such as image encoding and performing calculations. However, most existing approaches to augment {LLM}s with tools are constrained by general-purpose {API}s and lack the flexibility for tailoring them to specific tasks. To address this limitation, we propose {CRAFT}, a general tool creation and retrieval framework for {LLM}s. {CRAFT} creates toolsets specifically curated for the tasks and equips {LLM}s with a component that retrieves tools from these sets to enhance their capability to solve complex tasks. For each task, we collect specific code solutions by prompting {GPT}-4 to solve the training examples, then abstract them into diverse, reusable, and executable tools. During inference, {CRAFT} employs a multi-view matching approach, incorporating information about the target problem, {API} names, and docstrings, to identify and utilize relevant tools. We evaluate {CRAFT} on vision-language, tabular processing, and mathematical reasoning tasks and achieve substantial improvements compared to strong baselines. Our analysis reveals that consistent performance improvement can be achieved by scaling up the number of tools and the capability of the backbone models.},

The encoding is decodable, which enables neural networks to regress continuous objects by regressing their encodings. We demonstrate {HDFE}'s effectiveness in two applications: function-to-function mapping where vanilla {HDFE} achieves competitive performance with the state-of-the-art algorithm, and point cloud surface normal estimation where a simple replacement from {PointNet} to {HDFE} leads to 12\% and 15\% error reductions in two benchmarks.

Different from existing diffusion-based approaches, we train the model to directly reconstruct the sample instead of the noise in each diffusion step, combining a {F}ourier-based loss term. Diffusion-{TS} is expected to generate time series satisfying both interpretability and realness. The proposed Diffusion-{TS} can be easily extended to conditional generation tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, without any model changes.

However, when applied to Large Language Models ({LLM}s), traditional binarization methods suffer significant performance degradation. This paper explores network binarization specifically for {LLM}s compression and proposes a novel approach, Partially-Binarized {LLM} ({PB}-{LLM}), which can achieve extreme low-bit quantization while maintaining the linguistic reasoning capacity of quantized {LLM}s. Our exploration first uncovers the ineffectiveness of naive applications of existing binarization algorithms and highlights the imperative role of salient weights in achieving low-bit quantization. Thus, {PB}-{LLM} filters a small ratio of salient weights during binarization, allocating them to higher-bit storage, i.e., partially-binarization. {PB}-{LLM} is extended to recover the capacities of quantized {LLM}s by analyzing from the perspective of both post-training quantization ({PTQ}) and quantization-aware training ({QAT}). Under {PTQ}, we reconstruct the binarized weight matrix guided by the {H}essian matrix. Under {QAT}, we freeze the salient weights during training and explore the derivation of optimal scaling factors crucial for minimizing the quantization error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that {PB}-{LLM} achieves substantial performance improvements compared to traditional binarization approaches while significantly compressing the model size.},

Meta-learning methods leverage data from previous tasks to learn a new task in a sample-efficient manner. Although it has been empirically suggested that such methods perform well by learning shared representations during pretraining, there is limited theoretical evidence of such behavior. More importantly, it has not been shown that these methods still learn a shared structure, despite architectural misspecifications. This work shows, in the limit of an infinite number of tasks, that first-order {ANIL} with a linear two-layer network architecture successfully learns linear shared representations. This result even holds with overparametrization; having a width larger than the dimension of the shared representations results in an asymptotically low-rank solution. The learned solution then yields a good adaptation performance on any new task after a single gradient step. Overall, this illustrates how well model-agnostic methods such as first-order {ANIL} can learn shared representations.},

@inproceedings{yvinec2024network,
  abstract = {The massive interest in deep neural networks ({DNN}s) for both computer vision and natural language processing has been sparked by the growth in computational power. However, this led to an increase in the memory footprint, to a point where it can be challenging to simply load a model on commodity devices such as mobile phones. To address this limitation, quantization is a favored solution as it maps high precision tensors to a low precision, memory efficient format. In terms of memory footprint reduction, its most effective variants are based on codebooks. These methods, however, suffer from two limitations. First, they either define a single codebook for each tensor, or use a memory-expensive mapping to multiple codebooks. Second, gradient descent optimization of the mapping favors jumps toward extreme values, hence not defining a proximal search. In this work, we propose to address these two limitations. First, we initially group similarly distributed neurons and leverage the re-ordered structure to either apply different scale factors to the different groups, or map weights that fall in these groups to several codebooks, without any mapping overhead. Second, stemming from this initialization, we propose a joint learning of the codebook and weight mappings that bears similarities with recent gradient-based post-training quantization techniques. Third, drawing estimation from straight-through estimation techniques, we introduce a novel gradient update definition to enable a proximal search of the codebooks and their mappings. The proposed jointly learnable codebooks and mappings ({JLCM}) method allows a very efficient approximation of any {DNN}: as such, a {Llama} 7{B} can be compressed down to 2{Go} and loaded on 5-year-old smartphones.},

  abstract = {Goal representation affects the performance of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning ({HRL}) algorithms by decomposing the complex learning problem into easier subtasks. Recent studies show that representations that preserve temporally abstract environment dynamics are successful in solving difficult problems and provide theoretical guarantees for optimality. These methods however cannot scale to tasks where environment dynamics increase in complexity i.e. the temporally abstract transition relations depend on larger number of variables. On the other hand, other efforts have tried to use spatial abstraction to mitigate the previous issues. Their limitations include scalability to high dimensional environments and dependency on prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel three-layer {HRL} algorithm that introduces, at different levels of the hierarchy, both a spatial and a temporal goal abstraction. We provide theoretical analysis for the resulting algorithm and demonstrate the effectiveness of spatial and temporal abstractions on complex goal-reaching tasks. We show that our algorithm generalizes both \textit{classical temporal} and \textit{classical spatial} abstractions. Our algorithm generally outperforms baselines and existing {HRL} approaches in navigation and robotic manipulation tasks.},

  abstract = {Existing vision-language models exhibit strong generalization on a variety of visual domains and tasks. However, such models mainly perform zero-shot recognition in a closed-set manner, and thus struggle to handle open-domain visual concepts by design. There are recent finetuning methods, such as prompt learning, that not only study the discrimination between in-distribution ({ID}) and out-of-distribution ({OOD}) samples, but also show some improvements in both {ID} and {OOD} accuracies. In this paper, we first demonstrate that vision-language models, after long enough finetuning but without proper regularization, tend to overfit the known classes in the given dataset, with degraded performance on unknown classes. Then we propose a novel approach {OGEN} to address this pitfall, with the main focus on improving the {OOD} {GEN}eralization of finetuned models. Specifically, a class-conditional feature generator is introduced to synthesize {OOD} features using just the class name of any unknown class. Such synthesized features will provide useful knowledge about unknowns and help regularize the decision boundary between {ID} and {OOD} data when optimized jointly. Equally important is our adaptive self-distillation mechanism to regularize our feature generation model during joint optimization, i.e., adaptively transferring knowledge between model states to further prevent overfitting. Experiments validate that our method yields convincing gains in {OOD} generalization performance in different settings.},

This makes it directly applicable to transductive node-classification. However, conventional {CP} cannot be applied in inductive settings due to the implicit shift in the (calibration) scores caused by message passing with the new nodes. We fix this issue for both cases of node and edge-exchangeable graphs, recovering the standard coverage guarantee without sacrificing statistical efficiency. We further prove that the guarantee holds independently of the prediction time, e.g. upon arrival of a new node/edge or at any subsequent moment. Our approach enables principled uncertainty quantification for {GNN}s in inductive node classification, facilitating their deployment in safety-critical applications.},

However, real-world systems frequently favor less efficient non-learned methods due to their ability to offer (worst-case) error guarantees - an aspect where learned approaches often fall short. The primary objective of these guarantees is to ensure system reliability, ensuring that the chosen approach consistently delivers the desired level of accuracy across all databases. This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in deploying learned database operations: the lack of theoretical guarantees on their performance poses a significant hurdle to their practical deployment, especially since the non-learned alternatives often provide the required theoretical guarantees. Such guarantees are needed to ensure the reliability of the learned operations across all databases at deployment time, that is, to ensure consistent performance of the learned model on databases where the learned model had not been apriori evaluated. This research represents the first theoretical study of such guarantees for learned methods, presenting the necessary conditions for such guarantees to hold when using machine learning models for database operations.},

Despite its huge success in practice, the theoretical underpinnings of {LoRA} have largely remained unexplored. This paper takes the first step to bridge this gap by theoretically analyzing the expressive power of {LoRA}. We prove that {LoRA} can adapt any model to accurately represent any smaller target model if {LoRA}-rank is greater than or equal to (width of the original model) times (depth of target model) divided by (depth of the original model). For Transformer networks, we show any model can be adapted to a target model of the same size with rank-(embedding size/2) {LoRA} adapters. We also quantify the approximation error when the {LoRA}-rank is lower than the threshold. This represents the first known theoretical results on the expressive power of {LoRA}. The study reveals numerous theoretical insights on hyperparameter tuning and algorithm development for {LoRA}, all of which are empirically validated.},

  abstract = {Realistic graphs contain both (1) rich self-features of nodes and (2) informative structures of neighborhoods, jointly handled by a Graph Neural Network (GNN) in the typical setup. We propose to decouple the two modalities by Mixture of weak and strong experts (Mowst), where the weak expert is a light-weight Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), and the strong expert is an off-the-shelf GNN. To adapt the experts' collaboration to different target nodes, we propose a "confidence" mechanism based on the dispersion of the weak expert's prediction logits. The strong expert is conditionally activated in the low-confidence region when either the node's classification relies on neighborhood information, or the weak expert has low model quality. We reveal interesting training dynamics by analyzing the influence of the confidence function on loss: our training algorithm encourages the specialization of each expert by effectively generating soft splitting of the graph. In addition, our "confidence" design imposes a desirable bias toward the strong expert to benefit from GNN's better generalization capability. Mowst is easy to optimize and achieves strong expressive power, with a computation cost comparable to a single GNN. Empirically, Mowst on 4 backbone GNN architectures show significant accuracy improvement on 6 standard node classification benchmarks, including both homophilous and heterophilous graphs.},

This scenario is formulated as Evolving Domain Generalization (EDG), where models aim to generalize well to unseen target domains in a time-varying system by learning and leveraging the underlying evolving pattern of the distribution shifts across domains. However, existing methods encounter challenges due to the limited number of timestamps (every domain corresponds to a timestamp) in EDG datasets, leading to difficulties in capturing evolving dynamics and risking overfitting to the sparse timestamps, which hampers their generalization and adaptability to new tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach SDE-EDG that collects the Infinitely Fined-Grid Evolving Trajectory (IFGET) of the data distribution with continuous-interpolated samples to bridge temporal gaps (intervals between two successive timestamps). Furthermore, by leveraging the inherent capacity of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to capture continuous trajectories, we propose their use to align and enhance the learning process in evolving domain scenarios.},

  abstract = {As research in large language models (LLMs) continues to accelerate, LLM-based evaluation has emerged as a scalable and cost-effective alternative to human evaluations for comparing the ever increasing list of models. This paper investigates the efficacy of these \"LLM evaluators\", particularly in using them to assess instruction following, a metric that gauges how closely generated text adheres to the given instruction. We introduce a challenging meta-evaluation benchmark, LLMBar, designed to test the ability of an LLM evaluator in discerning instruction-following outputs. We manually curated 419 pairs of outputs, one adhering to instructions while the other diverging, yet may possess deceptive qualities that mislead an LLM evaluator, e.g., a more engaging tone. We discover that different LLM evaluators exhibit distinct performance and behavior patterns, with GPT-4 achieving the best performance with an accuracy of 80.3\% on our dataset. We also present novel prompting strategies to improve evaluation capability.},

  abstract = {Data augmentation is critical to the empirical success of modern self-supervised representation learning, such as contrastive learning and masked language modeling. However, a theoretical understanding of the exact role of the augmentation remains limited. Recent work has built the connection between self-supervised learning and the approximation of the top eigenspace of a graph Laplacian operator, suggesting that learning a linear probe atop such representation can be connected to RKHS regression. Building on this insight, this work delves into a statistical analysis of augmentation-based pretraining. Starting from the isometry property, a geometric characterization of the target function given by the augmentation, we disentangle the effects of the model and the augmentation, and prove two generalization bounds that are free of model complexity. Our first bound works for an arbitrary encoder, and it is the sum of an estimation error bound incurred by fitting a linear probe, and an approximation error bound by RKHS approximation. Our second bound specifically addresses the case where the encoder extracts the top-d eigenspace of a finite-sample-based approximation of the underlying RKHS. A key ingredient in our analysis is the augmentation complexity, which we use to quantitatively compare different augmentations and analyze their impact on downstream performance.},

  abstract = {Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) is a paradigm in which an RL agent learns to optimize a task using pair-wise preference-based feedback over trajectories, rather than explicit reward signals. While PbRL has demonstrated practical success in fine-tuning language models, existing theoretical work focuses on regret minimization and fails to capture most of the practical frameworks. In this study, we fill in such a gap between theoretical PbRL and practical algorithms by proposing a theoretical reward-agnostic PbRL framework where exploratory trajectories that enable accurate learning of hidden reward functions are acquired before collecting any human feedback. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our algorithm requires less human feedback for learning the optimal policy under preference-based models with linear parameterization and unknown transitions, compared to the existing theoretical literature. Specifically, our framework can incorporate linear and low-rank MDPs with efficient sample complexity. Additionally, we investigate reward-agnostic RL with action-based comparison feedback and introduce an efficient querying algorithm tailored to this scenario.},

Despite significant progress in recent years, most existing methods focus on uniformly distributed datasets, significantly limiting the practical applicability of their methods. In this paper, we first introduce a more practical problem setting named deep imbalanced clustering, where the underlying classes exhibit an imbalance distribution. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling-based learning framework. Our framework formulates pseudo-label generation as a progressive partial optimal transport problem, which progressively transports each sample to imbalanced clusters under prior distribution constraints, thus generating imbalance-aware pseudo-labels and learning from high-confident samples. In addition, we transform the initial formulation into an unbalanced optimal transport problem with augmented constraints, which can be solved efficiently by a fast matrix scaling algorithm.},

In this work, we propose a simple yet effective training framework called Structural Compression (StructComp) to address this issue. Inspired by a sparse low-rank approximation on the diffusion matrix, StructComp trains the encoder with the compressed nodes. This allows the encoder not to perform any message passing during the training stage, and significantly reduces the number of sample pairs in the contrastive loss. We theoretically prove that the original GCL loss can be approximated with the contrastive loss computed by StructComp. Moreover, StructComp can be regarded as an additional regularization term for GCL models, resulting in a more robust encoder. Empirical studies on various datasets show that StructComp greatly reduces the time and memory consumption while improving model performance compared to the vanilla GCL models and scalable training methods.},

In this work, we propose a training-free personalization approach for SAM, termed PerSAM. Given only a single reference image with a reference mask, PerSAM first localizes the target concept by a novel localization mechanism, and then guides SAM to segment objects in other images via target-guided attention and target-semantic prompting. Without any training, PerSAM can effectively segment the target object in different images while maintaining SAM's generalization ability. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets, demonstrating that PerSAM achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.},

  abstract = {Federated reinforcement learning ({FRL}) has emerged as a promising paradigm for reducing the sample complexity of reinforcement learning tasks by exploiting information from different agents. However, when each agent interacts with a potentially different environment, little to nothing is known theoretically about the non-asymptotic performance of {FRL} algorithms. The lack of such results can be attributed to various technical challenges and their intricate interplay: Markovian sampling, linear function approximation, multiple local updates to save communication, heterogeneity in the reward functions and transition kernels of the agents' {MDP}s, and continuous state-action spaces. Moreover, in the on-policy setting, the behavior policies vary with time, further complicating the analysis. In this work, we introduce {FedSARSA}, a novel federated on-policy reinforcement learning scheme, equipped with linear function approximation, to address these challenges and provide a comprehensive finite-time error analysis. Our theoretical results show that {FedSARSA} converges to a policy that is near-optimal for all agents, with the extent of near-optimality proportional to the level of heterogeneity. {FedSARSA} leverages agent collaboration to enable linear speedups as the number of agents increases, which holds for both fixed and adaptive step-size configurations.},

Here we launch the ultra-sparse advantage challenge to provide evidence on how ultra-sparse topologies (around 1\% connection retained) can achieve learning advantages against fully connected networks. We introduce two main methods: {ESML} (Epitopological Sparse Machine Learning) and {CHT} (Cannistraci-Hebb Training). Results show that with only 1\% of links retained during training, {CHT} surpasses fully connected networks on {VGG16}, {GoogLeNet}, {ResNet50}, and {ResNet152}, providing evidence for ultra-sparse advantage and marking a milestone in deep learning. {CHT} functions as a gradient-free oracle that uses {CH3-L3}-based epitopological learning to guide the placement of new links in ultra-sparse network topology, facilitating sparse-weight gradient learning and reducing convergence time. The term epitopological means new topology and refers to epitopological learning, which is a field of network science and complex network intelligence that studies how to implement learning on complex networks by changing the shape of their connectivity structure (epitopological plasticity).},

However, using {DPSGD-GC} to ensure Differential Privacy ({DP}) comes at the cost of model performance degradation due to {DP} noise injection and gradient clipping. Existing research has shown that {DPSGD-GC} only converges when using large clipping thresholds that are dependent on problem-specific parameters that are often unknown in practice. Unfortunately, these parameters are often unknown in practice, making it hard to choose the optimal clipping threshold. Therefore, {DPSGD-GC} suffers from degraded performance due to the constant bias introduced by the clipping. In our work, we propose a new error-feedback ({EF}) {DP} algorithm as an alternative to {DPSGD-GC}, which offers a diminishing utility bound without inducing a constant clipping bias. More importantly, it allows for an arbitrary choice of clipping threshold that is independent of the problem. We establish an algorithm-specific {DP} analysis for our proposed algorithm, providing privacy guarantees based on {R\\'enyi} {DP}.},

This holds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2) finetuned-conversion of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that recover task performance, and (3) pretrained-conversion of Transformers such as large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks. However, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in quality. To close this performance gap, we study what properties of softmax attention contribute to its effectiveness. We find prior linear attentions lack key properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or spiky) weights and dot-product monotonicity. We propose {Hedgehog}, a learnable linear attention that retains these spiky and monotonic properties while maintaining linear complexity. {Hedgehog} uses simple trainable {MLP}s to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention. Experiments show {Hedgehog} recovers over 99\% of standard Transformer quality in train-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior linear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on {WikiText-103} with causal {GPT}s, and up to 8.7 {GLUE} score points on finetuned bidirectional {BERT}s.},

  abstract = {Recent studies in using deep reinforcement learning ({DRL}) to solve Job-shop scheduling problems ({JSSP}) focus on construction heuristics. However, their performance is still far from optimality, mainly because the underlying graph representation scheme is unsuitable for modelling partial solutions at each construction step. This paper proposes a novel {DRL}-guided improvement heuristic for solving {JSSP}, where graph representation is employed to encode complete solutions. We design a Graph-Neural-Network-based representation scheme, consisting of two modules to effectively capture the information of dynamic topology and different types of nodes in graphs encountered during the improvement process. To speed up solution evaluation during improvement, we present a novel message-passing mechanism that can evaluate multiple solutions simultaneously. We prove that the computational complexity of our method scales linearly with problem size. Experiments on classic benchmarks show that the improvement policy learned by our method outperforms state-of-the-art {DRL}-based methods by a large margin.},

However, although these methods greatly improve the algorithmic fairness of {GNNs}, the fairness can be easily corrupted by carefully designed adversarial attacks. In this paper, we investigate adversarial attacks on fairness of {GNNs} and propose {G-FairAttack}, a general framework for attacking various types of fairness-aware {GNNs} in terms of fairness with an unnoticeable effect on prediction utility. Additionally, we propose a fast computation technique to reduce the time complexity of {G-FairAttack}.

While previous research either presupposes a cost-free communication channel or relies on a centralized controller with shared observations, we harness the commonsense knowledge, reasoning ability, language comprehension, and text generation prowess of {LLMs} and seamlessly incorporate them into a cognitive-inspired modular framework that integrates with perception, memory, and execution. Our framework consists of five key modules: Perception, Memory, Communication, Planning, and Execution. The Communication Module and the Planning Module leverage {LLMs} to generate messages and make plans, while the Memory Module stores knowledge and experience. Experiments on {C-WAH} and {TDW-MAT} demonstrate that our approach driven by {GPT-4} can surpass strong planning-based methods by achieving more than 40\% efficiency improvements and exhibit emergent effective communication. We also discovered that our approach communicating in natural language can earn more trust and cooperate more effectively with humans.},

  abstract = {A recent paper by Farina \& Pipis (2023) established the existence of uncoupled no-linear-swap regret dynamics with polynomial-time iterations in extensive-form games. The equilibrium points reached by these dynamics, known as linear correlated equilibria, are currently the tightest known relaxation of correlated equilibrium that can be learned in polynomial time in any finite extensive-form game. However, their properties remain vastly unexplored, and their computation is onerous. In this paper, we provide several contributions shedding light on the fundamental nature of linear-swap regret. We show a connection between linear deviations and a generalization of communication deviations in which the player can make queries to a mediator who replies with action recommendations, and the player is not constrained to match the timing of the game. We coin this latter set the untimed communication ({UTC}) deviations. We prove that {UTC} deviations coincide precisely with linear deviations, so any player minimizing {UTC} regret also minimizes linear-swap regret. Leveraging this connection, we develop state-of-the-art no-regret algorithms for computing linear correlated equilibria with polynomially better per-iteration runtimes in theory and several orders of magnitude improvements in practice.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that Sharpness-Aware Minimization ({SAM}) can improve the generalization of neural networks. However, {SAM}'s improvement becomes less significant or even worse when the training data has domain shifts. In this work, we present a Domain-Inspired Sharpness-Aware Minimization ({DISAM}) algorithm. It is motivated by the inconsistent convergence degree of {SAM} across different domains, which induces optimization bias towards certain domains and thus impairs the overall convergence. To address this issue, we consider the domain-level convergence consistency in the sharpness estimation to prevent the overwhelming perturbations for less optimized domains and deficient perturbations for well optimized domains. Specifically, {DISAM} introduces the constraint of minimizing variance in the domain loss, which allows the elastic gradient calibration in perturbation generation: when one domain is optimized above the averaging level with respect to loss, the gradient perturbation towards that domain will be weakened automatically, and vice versa. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves consistent improvements over {SAM} on various domain shift benchmarks.},

@inproceedings{zhang2024metalearning,

Recent approaches use a family of prior probability density functions or recurrent neural network models, whose parameters can be optimized by utilizing labeled data from observed tasks. While these approaches have appealing empirical performance, expressiveness of their prior is relatively low, which limits generalization and interpretation of meta-learning. This work puts forth a novel prior representation model that leverages the notion of algorithm unrolling, aiming at expressive yet meaningful priors. The key idea is to unroll the proximal gradient descent steps, where learnable piecewise linear functions are developed to approximate the desired proximal operators within tight theoretical error bounds established for both smooth and non-smooth proximal functions. The resultant unrolled proximal networks are trained meta-learners over related tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive performance against recent meta-learning methods.},

  abstract = {Designing expressive Graph Neural Networks ({GNNs}) is a fundamental topic in graph learning. So far, {GNN} expressiveness has been primarily assessed via the Weisfeiler-Lehman ({WL}) hierarchy. However, such an expressivity measure has notable limitations: it is inherently coarse, qualitative, and may not well reflect practical requirements (e.g., the ability to encode substructures). In this work, we introduce a unified framework for quantitatively studying the expressiveness of {GNN} architectures, which addresses all the above limitations. Specifically, we identify a fundamental expressivity measure termed homomorphism expressivity, which quantifies the ability of {GNN} models to count graphs under homomorphism. Homomorphism expressivity offers a complete and practical assessment tool: the completeness enables direct expressivity comparisons between {GNN} models, while the practicality allows for understanding concrete {GNN} abilities such as subgraph counting. By examining four classes of prominent {GNNs} as case studies, we derive simple, unified, and elegant descriptions of their homomorphism expressivity for both invariant and equivariant settings. Our results provide novel insights into a series of previous work, unify the landscape of different subareas in the community, and settle several open questions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world tasks verify our theory.},

In this work, we present {TapMo}, a Text-driven Animation Pipeline for synthesizing Motion in a broad spectrum of skeleton-free 3D characters. The pivotal innovation in {TapMo} is its use of shape deformation-aware features as a condition to guide the diffusion model, thereby enabling the generation of mesh-specific motions for various characters. {TapMo} comprises two main components -- Mesh Handle Predictor and Shape-aware Diffusion Module. The former predicts the skinning weights and clusters mesh vertices into adaptive handles for deformation control, which eliminates the need for traditional skeletal rigging. The latter employs text-guided motions and mesh features extracted during the first stage, preserving the geometric integrity of the animations by accounting for the character's shape and deformation. Trained in a weakly-supervised manner, {TapMo} can accommodate a multitude of non-human meshes, both with and without associated text motions. The effectiveness and generalizability of {TapMo} have been demonstrated through rigorous qualitative and quantitative experiments. The results reveal that {TapMo} consistently outperforms existing auto-animation methods, delivering superior-quality animations for both seen or unseen heterogeneous 3D characters.},

We effectively and efficiently scale diffusion models for planning in extended temporal, state, and task dimensions to tackle long horizon control problems conditioned on natural language instructions, as a step towards generalist agents. Comparing LCD with other state-of-the-art models on the CALVIN language benchmark finds that LCD outperforms other SOTA methods in multi-task success rates, whilst improving inference speed over other comparable diffusion models by 3.3x~15x.

  abstract = {Dropout is a widely utilized regularization technique in the training of neural networks, nevertheless, its underlying mechanism and impact on achieving good generalization abilities remain to be further understood. In this work, we start by undertaking a rigorous theoretical derivation of the stochastic modified equations, with the primary aim of providing an effective approximation for the discrete iterative process of dropout. Meanwhile, we experimentally verify SDE's ability to approximate dropout under a wider range of settings. Subsequently, we empirically delve into the intricate mechanisms by which dropout facilitates the identification of flatter minima. This exploration is conducted through intuitive approximations, exploiting the structural analogies inherent in the Hessian of loss landscape and the covariance of dropout. Our empirical findings substantiate the ubiquitous presence of the Hessian-variance alignment relation throughout the training process of dropout.},

  abstract = {We present a method for 3D reconstruction of moving articulated objects from monocular videos without additional information about object structure. Our approach treats an articulated object as an unknown, semi-rigid skeletal structure surrounded by nonrigid material. We simultaneously estimate the visible representation (3D shapes, colors, camera parameters) and the implicit skeletal representation from motion cues in the object video without 3D supervision. The implicit representation consists of four components: skeleton, skinning weights, rigidity coefficients, and time-varying transformations. We introduce an algorithm that uses physical constraints as regularization terms and iteratively estimates both implicit and explicit representations. Our approach is category-agnostic, thus eliminating the need for category-specific skeletons, and we demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art across standard video datasets.},

  abstract = {Open-ended algorithms aim to learn new, interesting behaviors forever. That requires a vast environment search space, but there are thus infinitely many possible tasks. Even after filtering for tasks the current agent can learn (i.e., learning progress), countless learnable yet uninteresting tasks remain (e.g., minor variations of previously learned tasks). An Achilles Heel of open-endedness research is the inability to quantify (and thus prioritize) tasks that are not just learnable, but also interesting (e.g., worthwhile and novel). We propose solving this problem by Open-endedness via Models of human Notions of Interestingness (OMNI). The insight is that we can utilize foundation models (FMs) as a model of interestingness (MoI), because they already internalize human concepts of interestingness from training on vast amounts of human-generated data, where humans naturally write about what they find interesting or boring. We show that FM-based MoIs improve open-ended learning by focusing on tasks that are both learnable and interesting, outperforming baselines based on uniform task sampling or learning progress alone.},

Although offering improved data privacy protection, domain-specific small language models (SLMs) often underperform LLMs, emphasizing the need for methods that reduce this performance gap while alleviating privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method that harnesses LLMs' medical proficiency to boost SLM performance in medical tasks under privacy-restricted scenarios. Specifically, we mitigate patient privacy issues by extracting keywords from medical data and prompting the LLM to generate a medical knowledge-intensive context by simulating clinicians' thought processes.

This problem has broad applications in practical scenarios, e.g., reserve price optimization in online auctions, online task assignments in crowdsourcing, setting recruiting bars in hiring, etc. We first characterize the query complexity of learning a threshold with the expected reward at most ε smaller than the optimum and prove that the number of queries needed can be infinitely large even when g(γ, v) is monotone with respect to both γ and v.

Previous proficient CL methods perform very poorly in this challenging setting, with overfitting to the sparse labeled data and insufficient computational budget being the two main culprits for such poor performance. The new setting encourages learning methods to effectively and efficiently utilize the unlabeled data during training. To address this, we propose a simple but highly effective baseline called DietCL, which utilizes both unlabeled and labeled data jointly and meticulously allocates computational budget for both types of data. We validate our baseline at scale on several datasets including CLOC, ImageNet10K, and CGLM under constrained budget setups. DietCL outperforms by a large margin all existing supervised CL algorithms as well as more recent continual semi-supervised methods.},

In this work, we systematically examine the impact of methodological details in activation patching, including evaluation metrics and corruption methods.

Recently, Imitation Learning (IL)-based policies have emerged as potent alternatives to traditional rule-based approaches. However, it is nontrivial to acquire high-quality training samples, and IL often converges to suboptimal variable choices for branching, restricting the overall performance. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid online and offline reinforcement learning (RL) approach to enhance the branching policy by cost-effective training sample augmentation. In the online phase, we train an online RL agent to dynamically decide the sample generation processes, drawing from either the learning-based policy or the expert policy. The objective is to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation of the sample generation process.},

In this paper, we first propose a novel deep anomaly detection model that improves the original hypersphere learning through an orthogonal projection layer, which ensures that the training data distribution is consistent with the hypersphere hypothesis, thereby increasing the true positive rate and decreasing the false negative rate. Moreover, we propose a bi-hypersphere compression method to obtain a hyperspherical shell that yields a more compact decision region than a hyperball, which is demonstrated theoretically and numerically. The proposed methods are not confined to common datasets such as image and tabular data, but are also extended to a more challenging but promising scenario, graph-level anomaly detection, which learns graph representation with maximum mutual information between the substructure and global structure features while exploring orthogonal single- or bi-hypersphere anomaly decision boundaries. The numerical and visualization results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our methods in comparison to many baselines and state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {In human-written articles, we often leverage the subtleties of text style, such as bold and italics, to guide the attention of readers. These textual emphases are vital for the readers to grasp the conveyed information. When interacting with large language models ({LLM}s), we have a similar need -- steering the model to pay closer attention to user-specified information, e.g., an instruction. Existing methods, however, are constrained to process plain text and do not support such a mechanism. This motivates us to introduce {PASTA} -- Post-hoc Attention {STeering} Approach, a method that allows {LLM}s to read text with user-specified emphasis marks. To this end, {PASTA} identifies a small subset of attention heads and applies precise attention reweighting on them, directing the model attention to user-specified parts. Like prompting, {PASTA} is applied at inference time and does not require changing any model parameters. Experiments demonstrate that {PASTA} can substantially enhance an {LLM}'s ability to follow user instructions or integrate new knowledge from user inputs, leading to a significant performance improvement on a variety of tasks, e.g., an average accuracy improvement of 22\% for {LLAMA}-7B. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/QingruZhang/PASTA.},

@inproceedings{zhang2024detecting,
  abstract = {Large language models ({LLM}s) such as {ChatGPT} have exhibited remarkable performance in generating human-like texts. However, machine-generated texts ({MGT}s) may carry critical risks, such as plagiarism issues, misleading information, or hallucination issues. Therefore, it is very urgent and important to detect {MGT}s in many situations. Unfortunately, it is challenging to distinguish {MGT}s and human-written texts because the distributional discrepancy between them is often very subtle due to the remarkable performance of {LLM}s. In this paper, we seek to exploit maximum mean discrepancy ({MMD}) to address this issue in the sense that {MMD} can well identify distributional discrepancies. However, directly training a detector with {MMD} using diverse {MGT}s will incur a significantly increased variance of {MMD} since {MGT}s may contain multiple text populations due to various {LLM}s. This will severely impair {MMD}'s ability to measure the difference between two samples. To tackle this, we propose a novel multi-population aware optimization method for {MMD} called {MMD-MP}, which can avoid variance increases and thus improve the stability to measure the distributional discrepancy. Relying on {MMD-MP}, we develop two methods for paragraph-based and sentence-based detection, respectively. Extensive experiments on various {LLM}s, e.g., {GPT2} and {ChatGPT}, show superior detection performance of our {MMD-MP}.},

However, this assumption is under-explored due to the poorly understood geometry of the multi-modal contrastive space, where a modality gap exists. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for the modality gap and analyze the geometry of multi-modal contrastive representation space. Based on our analysis, we then propose {C}$^3$ -- Connect, Collapse, Corrupt, a simple method to bridge the modality gap. {C}$^3$ enhances the interchangeability of embeddings from different modalities in the multi-modal contrastive space, and thus enables cross-modal tasks to be learned with uni-modal data. We validate our method on image captioning, text-to-image generation, audio captioning, and other cross-modal tasks. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot settings and demonstrates consistent improvements across different modalities, datasets, and embedding spaces.},

  abstract = {Offline preference-based reinforcement learning ({PbRL}) offers an effective solution to overcome the challenges associated with designing rewards and the high costs of online interactions. In offline {PbRL}, agents are provided with a fixed dataset containing human preferences between pairs of trajectories. Previous studies mainly focus on recovering the rewards from the preferences, followed by policy optimization with an off-the-shelf offline {RL} algorithm. However, given that preference label in {PbRL} is inherently trajectory-based, accurately learning transition-wise rewards from such label can be challenging, potentially leading to misguidance during subsequent offline {RL} training. To address this issue, we introduce our method named Flow-to-Better ({FTB}), which leverages the pairwise preference relationship to guide a generative model in producing preferred trajectories, avoiding Temporal Difference ({TD}) learning with inaccurate rewards. Conditioning on a low-preference trajectory, {FTB} uses a diffusion model to generate a better one with a higher preference, achieving high-fidelity full-horizon trajectory improvement. During diffusion training, we propose a technique called Preference Augmentation to alleviate the problem of insufficient preference data. As a result, we surprisingly find that the model-generated trajectories not only exhibit increased preference and consistency with the real transition but also introduce elements of novelty and diversity, from which we can derive a desirable policy through imitation learning. Experimental results on {D4RL} benchmarks demonstrate that {FTB} achieves a remarkable improvement compared to state-of-the-art offline {PbRL} methods. Furthermore, we show that {FTB} can also serve as an effective data augmentation method for offline {RL}.},

@inproceedings{zhang2024sampleefficient,
  abstract = {A powerful concept behind much of the recent progress in machine learning is the extraction of common features across data from heterogeneous sources or tasks. Intuitively, using all of one's data to learn a common representation function benefits both computational effort and statistical generalization by leaving a smaller number of parameters to fine-tune on a given task. Toward theoretically grounding these merits, we propose a general setting of recovering linear operators $M$ from noisy vector measurements $y = Mx + w$, where the covariates $x$ may be both non-i.i.d. and non-isotropic. We demonstrate that existing isotropy-agnostic meta-learning approaches incur biases on the representation update, which causes the scaling of the noise terms to lose favorable dependence on the number of source tasks. This in turn can cause the sample complexity of representation learning to be bottlenecked by the single-task data size. We introduce an adaptation, De-bias \& Feature-Whiten ({DFW}), of the popular alternating minimization-descent ({AMD}) scheme proposed in Collins et al., (2021), and establish linear convergence to the optimal representation with noise level scaling down with the total source data size. This leads to generalization bounds on the same order as an oracle empirical risk minimizer. We verify the vital importance of {DFW} on various numerical simulations. In particular, we show that vanilla alternating-minimization descent fails catastrophically even for iid, but mildly non-isotropic data.},

In this work, we take a significant step beyond existing work by giving the first nontrivial algorithm for zeroth-order stochastic optimization on nonconvex and nonsmooth objectives. Our algorithm satisfies ($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-differential privacy and can find an $(\epsilon, \epsilon^2/2)$-second-order stationary point with probability at least $1-\beta$ using $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{\epsilon^4} + \frac{d^2}{\beta \epsilon^{3/2}}\right)$ samples from the objective function, where $d$ is the problem dimension.

Prior approaches to text similarity fall into two camps: costly but accurate neural approaches and efficient but inaccurate non-neural approaches (e.g. {MinHash}). We bridge the gap between accuracy and efficiency by introducing {RETSim} (Resilient and Efficient Text Similarity), a neural text similarity model that is both highly efficient and resilient to a wide range of lexical, syntactic and semantic variations. {RETSim} is trained using a multi-stage training pipeline that initially trains the model on large amounts of unlabeled text pairs, followed by refinement stages using hard negatives and adversarial examples to improve robustness. We demonstrate that {RETSim} achieves better performance than existing text similarity approaches while being significantly more efficient, achieving an order of magnitude speedup over traditional neural approaches. Furthermore, we show that {RETSim} generalizes well across different domains and languages.

However, the methods typically rely on sufficient data with {HDR} ground-truths, which are difficult and costly to collect. In this work, to eliminate the need for labeled data, we propose {SelfHDR}, a self-supervised {HDR} reconstruction method that only requires dynamic multi-exposure images during training. Specifically, {SelfHDR} learns a reconstruction network under the supervision of two complementary components, which can be constructed from multi-exposure images and focus on {HDR} color as well as structure, respectively. To this end, we introduce an {HDR} color loss that enforces the model to learn reasonable color mappings by exploring the relations among different exposures. Meanwhile, we develop a structure consistency loss that encourages structural consistencies by leveraging the image statistics. The two losses jointly facilitate the self-supervised learning of {HDR} reconstruction in dynamic scenes. Experiments on real-world images demonstrate that {SelfHDR} achieves superior results against the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods, and comparable performance to supervised ones.},

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks ({GNN}s) have emerged as the leading deep learning models for graph-based representation learning. However, the training and inference of {GNN}s on large graphs remain resource-intensive, impeding their utility in real-world scenarios and curtailing their applicability in deeper and more sophisticated {GNN} architectures. To address this issue, the Graph Lottery Ticket ({GLT}) hypothesis assumes that {GNN} with random initialization harbors a pair of core subgraph and sparse subnetwork, which can yield comparable performance and higher efficiency to that of the original dense network and complete graph. Despite the promise that {GLT} shows, current {GLT} identification methods suffer two major limitations: 1) they focus exclusively on the edge sparsity while overlooking subnetwork sparsity, resulting in the suboptimal performance for diverse {GNN} architectures; 2) worse still, current methods suffer scalability issues when applied to deep {GNN}s, as they maintain the same topology structure across all layers. These challenges hinder the integration of {GLT} into deeper and larger-scale {GNN} contexts. To bridge this critical gap, this paper introduces an Adaptive, Dynamic, and Automated framework for identifying Graph Lottery Tickets ({AdaGLT}). Our proposed method derives its key advantages and addresses the above limitations through the following three aspects: 1) tailoring layer-adaptive sparse structures for various datasets and {GNN}s, thus endowing it with the capability to facilitate deeper {GNN}s; 2) integrating the pruning and training processes, thereby achieving a dynamic workflow encompassing both pruning and restoration; 3) automatically capturing graph lottery tickets across diverse sparsity levels, obviating the necessity for extensive pruning parameter tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our {AdaGLT} outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on diverse graph learning tasks while significantly reducing computational overhead.},

While improving performance on domain tasks, it often brings a side-effect of forgetting of the model's general abilities. In this study, we analyze the effects of finetuning on language models by dissecting its impacts on the modeling of topic, style, and factual knowledge in text. Our method uses instruction-following {LLMs} such as {ChatGPT} to auto-generate controlled-variable text examples which we use to probe the model. Our findings reveal that finetuning results in significant shifts in the language model's topic and style priors, while actual knowledge learning only contributes to a small fraction of the total probability change.},

The attention mechanism in {ViTs}, which integrates information from different image patches to the class token ([{CLS}]), renders traditional structured pruning methods used in {CNNs} unsuitable.

Specifically, our approach combines a) online evaluation of intra-layer importance for the [{CLS}] and b) offline evaluation of the inter-layer importance of each patch. The two importance scores are fused by minimizing a weighted average of {Kullback-Leibler} ({KL}) {Divergences} and patches are successively pruned at each layer by maintaining only the top-k most important ones.},

Even though it can be viewed as a special case of sequence modeling, progress for scaling world models on robotic applications such as autonomous driving has been somewhat less rapid than scaling language models with {Generative} {Pre-trained} {Transformers} ({GPT}). We identify two reasons as major bottlenecks: dealing with complex and unstructured observation space, and having a scalable generative model. Consequently, we propose {Copilot4D}, a novel world modeling approach that first tokenizes sensor observations with {VQVAE}, then predicts the future via discrete diffusion. To efficiently decode and denoise tokens in parallel, we recast {Masked} {Generative} {Image} {Transformer} as discrete diffusion and enhance it with a few simple changes. When applied to learning world models on point cloud observations, {Copilot4D} reduces prior {SOTA} {Chamfer} distance by more than 65\% for 1s prediction, and more than 50\% for 3s prediction, across {NuScenes}, {KITTI} {Odometry}, and {Argoverse2} datasets.},

  abstract = {Multimodal learning significantly benefits cancer survival prediction, especially the integration of pathological images and genomic data. Despite advantages of multimodal learning for cancer survival prediction, massive redundancy in multimodal data prevents it from extracting discriminative and compact information: (1) An extensive amount of intra-modal task-unrelated information blurs discriminability, especially for gigapixel whole slide images ({WSIs}) with many patches in pathology and thousands of pathways in genomic data, leading to an ``intra-modal redundancy'' issue. (2) Duplicated information among modalities dominates the representation of multimodal data, which makes modality-specific information prone to being ignored, resulting in an ``inter-modal redundancy'' issue. To address these, we propose a new framework, {Prototypical} {Information} {Bottlenecking} and {Disentangling} ({PIBD}), consisting of {Prototypical} {Information} {Bottleneck} ({PIB}) module for intra-modal redundancy and {Prototypical} {Information} {Disentanglement} ({PID}) module for inter-modal redundancy.},

When combined with the common practice of using a fixed threshold to declare a match, this gives rise to significant performance variations in terms of false accept rate ({FAR}) and false reject rate ({FRR}) across test classes and data distributions. We define this issue in {DML} as threshold inconsistency. The paper quantifies the notion of threshold inconsistency in deep metric learning through a novel variance-based metric, and introduces a simple yet effective regularization loss to improve threshold consistency for {DML} models.

These prompts are crucial for achieving strong performance. However, since the prompts need to be sampled from a large volume of annotated examples, finding the right prompt may result in high annotation costs. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an influence-driven selective annotation method that aims to minimize annotation costs while improving the quality of in-context examples. The essence of our method is to select a pivotal subset from a large-scale unlabeled data pool to annotate for the subsequent sampling of prompts. Specifically, a directed graph is first constructed to represent unlabeled data. Afterward, the influence of candidate unlabeled subsets is quantified with a diffusion process. A simple yet effective greedy algorithm for unlabeled data selection is lastly introduced.},

Advanced {FSSL} methods predominantly focus on training a single model on each client. However, this approach could lead to a discrepancy between the objective functions of labeled and unlabeled data, resulting in gradient conflicts. To alleviate gradient conflict, we propose a novel twin-model paradigm, called {Twinsight}, designed to enhance mutual guidance by providing insights from different perspectives of labeled and unlabeled data. In particular, {Twinsight} concurrently trains a supervised model with a supervised objective function while training an unsupervised model using an unsupervised objective function. To enhance the synergy between these two models, {Twinsight} introduces a neighborhood-preserving constraint, which encourages the preservation of the neighborhood relationship among data features.},

The channel-wise Transformer block performs direct global context interactions across tokens defined by channel dimension.

While existing methods mainly address parameter memory, the importance of activation memory has been overlooked. Especially for long input sequences, activation memory is expected to experience a significant exponential growth as the length of sequences increases. In this approach, we propose AutoChunk, an automatic and adaptive compiler system that efficiently reduces activation memory for long sequence inference by chunk strategies. The proposed system generates chunk plans by optimizing through multiple stages. In each stage, the chunk search pass explores all possible chunk candidates and the chunk selection pass identifies the optimal one. At runtime, AutoChunk employs code generation to automatically apply chunk strategies. The experiments demonstrate that AutoChunk can reduce over 80% of activation memory while maintaining speed loss within 10%, extend max sequence length by 3.2x to 11.7x, and outperform state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.},

However, conventional PINNs, relying on multilayer perceptrons (MLP), neglect the crucial temporal dependencies inherent in practical physics systems and thus fail to propagate the initial condition constraints globally and accurately capture the true solutions under various scenarios. We introduce PINNsFormer, a novel Transformer-based framework designed to address these limitations. PINNsFormer can accurately approximate PDE solutions by utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies, transforms point-wise inputs into pseudo sequences, and replaces point-wise PINNs loss with a sequential loss. It incorporates a novel activation function, Wavelet, which anticipates Fourier decomposition through deep neural networks. Empirical results demonstrate that PINNsFormer achieves superior generalization ability and accuracy across various scenarios, including PINNs failure modes and high-dimensional PDEs.},

Unlike most previous approaches that learn to decompose 2D images, DynaVol presents a 3D scene generative model that unifies geometric structures and object-centric learning in a differentiable volume rendering framework. The key idea is to perform object-centric voxelization to capture the 3D nature of the scene, which infers the probability distribution over objects at individual spatial locations. These voxel features evolve over time through a canonical-space deformation function, forming the basis for global representation learning via slot attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing superior object decomposition and reconstruction quality compared to existing methods.},

We argue that there exist locally stationary lead-lag relationships between variates, where some lagged variates may follow the leading indicators within a short time period. Exploiting such channel dependence is beneficial since leading indicators offer advance information that can be used to reduce the forecasting difficulty of the lagged variates. We propose LIFT, a novel method that efficiently estimates the relationships and dynamically incorporates leading indicators in the frequency domain for MTS forecasting. LIFT can work as a plug-and-play module and is generally applicable to arbitrary forecasting models. We also introduce LightMTS as a lightweight yet strong baseline for MTS forecasting, which keeps similar parameter efficiency with linear models and shows considerable performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

@inproceedings{zheng2024large,
  abstract = {Multiple choice questions (MCQs) serve as a common yet important task format in the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). This work shows that modern LLMs are vulnerable to option position changes in MCQs due to their inherent "selection bias", namely, they prefer to select specific option IDs as answers (like "Option A"). Through extensive empirical analyses with 20 LLMs on three benchmarks, we pinpoint that this behavioral bias primarily stems from LLMs' token bias, where the model a priori assigns more probabilistic mass to specific option ID tokens (e.g., A/B/C/D) when predicting answers from the option IDs. To mitigate selection bias, we propose a label-free, inference-time debiasing method, called PriDe, which separates the model's prior bias for option IDs from the overall prediction distribution. PriDe first estimates the prior by permutating option contents on a small number of test samples, and then applies the estimated prior to debias the remaining samples. We demonstrate that it achieves interpretable and transferable debiasing with high computational efficiency. We hope this work can draw broader research attention to the bias and robustness of modern LLMs.},

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are neural models that leverage the dependency structure in graphical data via message passing among the graph nodes. GNNs have emerged as pivotal architectures in analyzing graph-structured data, and their expansive application in sensitive domains requires a comprehensive understanding of their decision-making processes --- necessitating a framework for GNN explainability. An explanation function for GNNs takes a pre-trained GNN along with a graph as input, to produce a 'sufficient statistic' subgraph with respect to the graph label. A main challenge in studying GNN explainability is to provide fidelity measures that evaluate the performance of these explanation functions. This paper studies this foundational challenge, spotlighting the inherent limitations of prevailing fidelity metrics, including Fid₊, Fid₋, and FidΔ. Specifically, a formal, information-theoretic definition of explainability is introduced and it is shown that existing metrics often fail to align with this definition across various statistical scenarios. The reason is due to potential distribution shifts when subgraphs are removed in computing these fidelity measures. Subsequently, a robust class of fidelity measures are introduced, and it is shown analytically that they are resilient to distribution shift issues and are applicable in a wide range of scenarios. Extensive empirical analysis on both synthetic and real datasets are provided to illustrate that the proposed metrics are more coherent with gold standard metrics.},

Despite the seeming appeal, little (if any) prior work has demonstrated how self-supervised RL methods can be practically deployed on robotic systems. By first studying a challenging simulated version of this task, we discover design decisions about architectures and hyperparameters that increase the success rate by 2×.

We propose two federated Q-Learning algorithms termed as FedQ-Hoeffding and FedQ-Bernstein, respectively, and show that the corresponding total regrets achieve a linear speedup compared with their single-agent counterparts, while the communication cost scales logarithmically in the total number of time steps T. Those results rely on an event-triggered synchronization mechanism between the agents and the server, a novel step size selection when the server aggregates the local estimates of the state-action values to form the global estimates, and a set of new concentration inequalities to bound the sum of non-martingale differences. This is the first work showing that linear regret speedup and logarithmic communication cost can be achieved by model-free algorithms in federated reinforcement learning.},

@inproceedings{zheng2024safe,
  abstract = {Safe offline RL is a promising way to bypass risky online interactions towards safe policy learning. Most existing methods only enforce soft constraints, i.e., constraining safety violations in expectation below thresholds predetermined. This can lead to potentially unsafe outcomes, thus unacceptable in safety-critical scenarios. An alternative is to enforce the hard constraint of zero violation. However, this can be challenging in offline setting, as it needs to strike the right balance among three highly intricate and correlated aspects: safety constraint satisfaction, reward maximization, and behavior regularization imposed by offline datasets. Interestingly, we discover that via reachability analysis of safe-control theory, the hard safety constraint can be equivalently translated to identifying the largest feasible region given the offline dataset. This seamlessly converts the original trilogy problem to a feasibility-dependent objective, i.e., maximizing reward value within the feasible region while minimizing safety risks in the infeasible region. Inspired by these, we propose FISOR (FeasIbility-guided Safe Offline RL), which allows safety constraint adherence, reward maximization, and offline policy learning to be realized via three decoupled processes, while offering strong safety performance and stability. In FISOR, the optimal policy for the translated optimization problem can be derived in a special form of weighted behavior cloning. Thus, we propose a novel energy-guided diffusion model that does not require training a complicated time-dependent classifier to extract the policy, greatly simplifying the training.},

We apply this representation learning method to derive an off-policy algorithm for goal-conditioned RL. Experiments demonstrate that, compared with prior RL methods, ours achieves 2× median improvement in success rates and can better cope with stochastic environments. In tabular settings, we show that our method is about 20× more sample efficient than the successor representation and 1500× more sample efficient than the standard (Monte Carlo) version of contrastive predictive coding.},

This focus on quick reward gains undermines both the stability in training and the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. In this work, we propose a novel approach that can learn a consistent policy via RL across various data groups or domains. Given the challenges associated with acquiring group annotations, our method automatically classifies data into different groups, deliberately maximizing performance variance. Then, we optimize the policy to perform well on challenging groups. Lastly, leveraging the established groups, our approach adaptively adjusts the exploration space, allocating more learning capacity to more challenging data and preventing the model from over-optimizing on simpler data. Experimental results indicate that our approach significantly enhances training stability and model generalization.},

  abstract = {Evaluating the performance of a well-trained GNN model on real-world graphs is a pivotal step for reliable GNN online deployment and serving. Due to a lack of test node labels and unknown potential training-test graph data distribution shifts, conventional model evaluation encounters limitations in calculating performance metrics (e.g., test error) and measuring graph data-level discrepancies, particularly when the training graph used for developing GNNs remains unobserved during test time. In this paper, we study a new research problem, online GNN evaluation, which aims to provide valuable insights into the well-trained GNNs's ability to effectively generalize to real-world unlabeled graphs under the test-time graph distribution shifts. Concretely, we develop an effective learning behavior discrepancy score, dubbed LeBeD, to estimate the test-time generalization errors of well-trained GNN models. Through a novel GNN re-training strategy with a parameter-free optimality criterion, the proposed LeBeD comprehensively integrates learning behavior discrepancies from both node prediction and structure reconstruction perspectives. This enables the effective evaluation of the well-trained GNNs' ability to capture test node semantics and structural representations, making it an expressive metric for estimating the generalization error in online GNN evaluation. Extensive experiments on real-world test graphs under diverse graph distribution shifts could verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, revealing its strong correlation with ground-truth test errors on various well-trained GNN models.},

  abstract = {Modern techniques like contrastive learning have been effectively used in many areas, including computer vision, natural language processing, and graph-structured data. Creating positive examples that assist the model in learning robust and discriminative representations is a crucial stage in contrastive learning approaches. Usually, preset human intuition directs the selection of relevant data augmentations. Due to patterns that are easily recognized by humans, this rule of thumb works well in the vision and language domains. However, it is impractical to visually inspect the temporal structures in time series. The diversity of time series augmentations at both the dataset and instance levels makes it difficult to choose meaningful augmentations on the fly. Thus, although prevalent, contrastive learning with data augmentation has been less studied in the time series domain. In this study, we address this gap by analyzing time series data augmentation using information theory and summarizing the most commonly adopted augmentations in a unified format. We then propose a parametric augmentation method, AutoTCL, which can be adaptively employed to support time series representation learning.},

  abstract = {Building agents with large language models (LLMs) for computer control is a burgeoning research area, where the agent receives computer states and performs actions to complete complex tasks. Previous computer agents have demonstrated the benefits of in-context learning (ICL); however, their performance is hindered by several issues. First, the limited context length of LLMs and complex computer states restrict the number of exemplars, as a single webpage can consume the entire context. Second, the exemplars in current methods, such as high-level plans and multi-choice questions, cannot represent complete trajectories, leading to suboptimal performance in long-horizon tasks. Third, existing computer agents rely on task-specific exemplars and overlook the similarity among tasks, resulting in poor generalization to novel tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce Synapse, a computer agent featuring three key components: i) state abstraction, which filters out task-irrelevant information from raw states, allowing more exemplars within the limited context, ii) trajectory-as-exemplar prompting, which prompts the LLM with complete trajectories of the abstracted states and actions to improve multi-step decision-making, and iii) exemplar memory, which stores the embeddings of exemplars and retrieves them via similarity search for generalization to novel tasks. We evaluate Synapse on MiniWoB++, a standard task suite, and Mind2Web, a real-world website benchmark. In MiniWoB++, Synapse achieves a 99.2% average success rate (a 10% relative improvement) across 64 tasks using demonstrations from only 48 tasks. Notably, Synapse is the first ICL method to solve the book-flight task in MiniWoB++. Synapse also exhibits a 56% relative improvement in average step success rate over the previous state-of-the-art prompting methods.},

While various techniques address these computational challenges, a less-explored issue is designing an efficient and adaptable network backbone for iterative refinement. Current options like U-Net and Vision Transformer often rely on resource-intensive deep networks and lack the flexibility needed for generating images at variable resolutions or with a smaller network than used in training. In this work, we introduce the LEGO brick, a fundamental network unit that seamlessly integrates two essential components: Local-feature Enrichment and Global-content Orchestration. LEGO bricks can be stacked to create a test-time reconfigurable diffusion backbone. We explore stacking bricks with various input sizes to construct the network, enabling selective skipping of bricks to reduce sampling costs and generate higher-resolution images than the training data. Experimental results demonstrate that LEGO bricks enhance training efficiency, expedite convergence, and facilitate variable-resolution image generation while maintaining strong generative performance. Moreover, LEGO significantly reduces sampling time compared to other methods, establishing it as a valuable enhancement for diffusion models.},

  abstract = {Contrastive learning, while highly effective for a lot of tasks, shows limited improvement in ordinal regression. We find that the limitation comes from the predefined strong data augmentations employed in contrastive learning. Intuitively, for ordinal regression datasets, the discriminative information (ordinal content information) contained in instances is subtle. The strong augmentations can easily overshadow or diminish this ordinal content information. As a result, when contrastive learning is used to extract common features between weakly and strongly augmented images, the derived features often lack this essential ordinal content, rendering them less useful in training models for ordinal regression. To improve contrastive learning's utility for ordinal regression, we propose a novel augmentation method to replace the predefined strong augmentation based on the principle of minimal change. This approach preserves the ordinal structure of the data during the augmentation process, which is essential for tasks where the ordering of labels carries important semantic meaning.},

Conventionally, temperature scaling is applied to both teacher's logits and student's logits in KD. Motivated by some recent works, in this paper, we drop instead temperature scaling on the student side, and systematically study the resulting variant of KD, dubbed transformed teacher matching (TTM). By reinterpreting temperature scaling as a power transform of probability distribution, we show that in comparison with the original KD, TTM has an inherent Rényi entropy term in its objective function, which serves as an extra regularization term. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that thanks to this inherent regularization, TTM leads to trained students with better generalization than the original KD.},

@inproceedings{zheng2024noisediffusion,
  abstract = {Image interpolation based on diffusion models is promising in creating fresh and interesting images. Advanced interpolation methods mainly focus on spherical linear interpolation, where images are encoded into the noise space and then interpolated for denoising to images. However, existing methods face challenges in effectively interpolating natural images (not generated by diffusion models), thereby restricting their practical applicability. Our experimental investigations reveal that these challenges stem from the invalidity of the encoding noise, which may no longer obey the expected noise distribution, e.g., a normal distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach to correct noise for image interpolation, NoiseDiffusion. Specifically, NoiseDiffusion approaches the invalid noise to the expected distribution by introducing subtle Gaussian noise and introduces a constraint to suppress noise with extreme values. In this context, promoting noise validity contributes to mitigating image artifacts, but the constraint and introduced exogenous noise typically lead to a reduction in signal-to-noise ratio, i.e., loss of original image information. Hence, NoiseDiffusion performs interpolation within the noisy image space and injects raw images into these noisy counterparts to address the challenge of information loss. Consequently, NoiseDiffusion enables us to interpolate natural images without causing artifacts or information loss, thus achieving the best interpolation results.},

Being a convenient and straightforward model compression approach, Post-Training Quantization ({PTQ}) has been widely adopted in {2D} vision tasks. However, applying it directly to {3D} lidar-based tasks inevitably leads to performance degradation. As a remedy, we propose an effective {PTQ} method called {LiDAR-PTQ}, which is particularly curated for {3D} lidar detection (both {SPConv}-based and {SPConv}-free). Our {LiDAR-PTQ} features three main components: (1) a sparsity-based calibration method to determine the initialization of quantization parameters, (2) a Task-guided Global Positive Loss ({TGPL}) to reduce the disparity between the final predictions and the original model outputs, and (3) an adaptive rounding-to-nearest operation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our {LiDAR-PTQ} can achieve state-of-the-art quantization performance when applied to {CenterPoint} (both Pillar-based and Voxel-based). To our knowledge, for the very first time in lidar-based {3D} detection tasks, the {PTQ} {INT8} model's accuracy is almost the same as the {FP32} model while enjoying {3×} inference speedup.

In this paper, we explore targeted distillation with mission-focused instruction tuning to train student models that can excel in a broad application class such as open information extraction. Using named entity recognition ({NER}) for case study, we show how {ChatGPT} can be distilled into much smaller {UniversalNER} models for open {NER}. For evaluation, we assemble the largest {NER} benchmark to date, comprising 43 datasets across 9 diverse domains such as biomedicine, programming, social media, law, finance. Without using any direct supervision, {UniversalNER} attains remarkable {NER} accuracy across tens of thousands of entity types, outperforming general instruction-tuned models such as {Alpaca} and {Vicuna} by over 30 absolute {F1} points in average. With a tiny fraction of parameters, {UniversalNER} not only acquires {ChatGPT}'s capability in recognizing arbitrary entity types, but also outperforms its {NER} accuracy by 7--9 absolute {F1} points in average.

@inproceedings{zhou2024pareto,
  abstract = {Deep long-tailed recognition ({DTLR}) has attracted much attention due to its close touch with realistic scenarios. Recent advances have focused on re-balancing across various aspects, e.g., sampling strategy, loss re-weighting, logit adjustment, and input/parameter perturbation, to name a few. However, few studies have considered dynamic re-balancing to address intrinsic optimization conflicts. In this paper, we first empirically argue that the optimizations of mainstream {DLTR} methods are still dominated by some categories (e.g., major) due to a fixed re-balancing strategy. Thus, they fail to deal with gradient conflicts among categories, which naturally deduces the motivation for reaching {Pareto} optimal solutions. Unfortunately, a naive integration of multi-objective optimization ({MOO}) with {DLTR} methods is not applicable due to the gap between multi-task learning ({MTL}) and {DLTR}, and can in turn lead to class-specific feature degradation. Thus, we provide effective alternatives by decoupling {MOO}-based {MTL} from the temporal rather than structure perspective, and enhancing it via optimizing variability collapse loss motivated by the derived {MOO}-based {DLTR} generalization bound. Moreover, we resort to anticipating worst-case optimization with theoretical insights to further ensure convergence. We build a {Pareto} deep long-tailed recognition method termed {PLOT} upon the proposed {MOO} framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method not only generally improves mainstream pipelines, but also achieves an augmented version to realize state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Answering counterfactual queries has important applications such as explainability, robustness, and fairness but is challenging when the causal variables are unobserved and the observations are non-linear mixtures of these latent variables, such as pixels in images. One approach is to recover the latent Structural Causal Model ({SCM}), which may be infeasible in practice due to requiring strong assumptions, e.g., linearity of the causal mechanisms or perfect atomic interventions. Meanwhile, more practical {ML}-based approaches using naive domain translation models to generate counterfactual samples lack theoretical grounding and may construct invalid counterfactuals. In this work, we strive to strike a balance between practicality and theoretical guarantees by analyzing a specific type of causal query called \emph{domain counterfactuals}, which hypothesizes what a sample would have looked like if it had been generated in a different domain (or environment). We show that recovering the latent {SCM} is unnecessary for estimating domain counterfactuals, thereby sidestepping some of the theoretic challenges. By assuming invertibility and sparsity of intervention, we prove domain counterfactual estimation error can be bounded by a data fit term and intervention sparsity term. Building upon our theoretical results, we develop a theoretically grounded practical algorithm that simplifies the modeling process to generative model estimation under autoregressive and shared parameter constraints that enforce intervention sparsity. Finally, we show an improvement in counterfactual estimation over baseline methods through extensive simulated and image-based experiments.},

This raises the question of if and when {Transformer} models can learn the true algorithm for solving a task. We study the scope of {Transformers}' abilities in the specific setting of length generalization on algorithmic tasks. Here, we propose a unifying framework to understand when and how {Transformers} can exhibit strong length generalization on a given task. Specifically, we leverage {RASP} -- a programming language designed for the computational model of a {Transformer} -- and introduce the {RASP-Generalization Conjecture}: {Transformers} tend to length generalize on a task if the task can be solved by a short {RASP} program which works for all input lengths. This simple conjecture remarkably captures most known instances of length generalization on algorithmic tasks. Moreover, we leverage our insights to drastically improve generalization performance on traditionally hard tasks (such as parity and addition). Overall, our work provides a novel perspective on the mechanisms of compositional generalization and the algorithmic capabilities of {Transformers}.},

Moreover, by using scalable {Bayesian} inference, {PSI-KT} targets the real-world need for efficient personalization even with a growing body of learners and interaction data. Evaluated on three datasets from online learning platforms, {PSI-KT} achieves superior multi-step predictive accuracy and scalable inference in continual-learning settings, all while providing interpretable representations of learner-specific traits and the prerequisite structure of knowledge that causally supports learning. In sum, predictive, scalable and interpretable knowledge tracing with solid knowledge mapping lays a key foundation for effective personalized learning to make education accessible to a broad, global audience.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in high-fidelity virtual environments serve as one of the major driving forces for building intelligent embodied agents to perceive, reason and interact with the physical world. However, in real-world scenarios, agents might also face dynamically changing environments characterized by unexpected events and need to rapidly take action accordingly. To remedy this gap, we propose a new simulated embodied benchmark, called {HAZARD}, specifically designed to assess the decision-making abilities of embodied agents in dynamic situations. {HAZARD} consists of three unexpected disaster scenarios, including fire, flood, and wind, and specifically supports the utilization of large language models ({LLMs}) to assist common sense reasoning and decision-making. This benchmark enables us to evaluate autonomous agents' decision-making capabilities across various pipelines, including reinforcement learning ({RL}), rule-based, and search-based methods in dynamically changing environments. As a first step toward addressing this challenge using large language models, we further develop an {LLM}-based agent and perform an in-depth analysis of its promise and challenge of solving these challenging tasks.},

  abstract = {Recently, {3D} generative models have shown promising performances in structure-based drug design by learning to generate ligands given target binding sites. However, only modeling the target-ligand distribution can hardly fulfill one of the main goals in drug discovery -- designing novel ligands with desired properties, e.g., high binding affinity, easily synthesizable, etc. This challenge becomes particularly pronounced when the target-ligand pairs used for training do not align with these desired properties. Moreover, most existing methods aim at solving de novo design task, while many generative scenarios requiring flexible controllability, such as {R}-group optimization and scaffold hopping, have received little attention. In this work, we propose {DecompOpt}, a structure-based molecular optimization method based on a controllable and decomposed diffusion model. {DecompOpt} presents a new generation paradigm which combines optimization with conditional diffusion models to achieve desired properties while adhering to the molecular grammar. Additionally, {DecompOpt} offers a unified framework covering both de novo design and controllable generation. To achieve so, ligands are decomposed into substructures which allows fine-grained control and local optimization. Experiments show that {DecompOpt} can efficiently generate molecules with improved properties than strong de novo baselines, and demonstrate great potential in controllable generation tasks.},

However, LVLMs still suffer from object hallucination, which is the problem of generating descriptions that include objects that do not actually exist in the images. This can negatively impact many vision-language tasks, such as visual summarization and reasoning. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet powerful algorithm, LVLM Hallucination Revisor (LURE), to post-hoc rectify object hallucination in LVLMs by reconstructing less hallucinatory descriptions. LURE can also be seamlessly integrated with any LVLMs. We evaluate LURE on six open-source LVLMs, achieving a 23\% improvement in general object hallucination evaluation metrics over the previous best approach. In both GPT and human evaluations, LURE consistently ranks at the top.},

  abstract = {The study of decoding visual neural information faces challenges in generalizing single-subject decoding models to multiple subjects, due to individual differences. Moreover, the limited availability of data from a single subject has a constraining impact on model performance. Although prior multi-subject decoding methods have made significant progress, they still suffer from several limitations, including difficulty in extracting global neural response features, linear scaling of model parameters with the number of subjects, and inadequate characterization of the relationship between neural responses of different subjects to various stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we propose a CLIP-guided Multi-sUbject visual neural information SEmantic Decoding (CLIP-MUSED) method. It also incorporates learnable subject-specific tokens that facilitates the aggregation of multi-subject data without a linear increase of parameters. Additionally, we employ representational similarity analysis (RSA) to guide token representation learning based on the topological relationship of visual stimuli in the representation space of CLIP, enabling full characterization of the relationship between neural responses of different subjects under different stimuli. Finally, token representations are used for multi-subject semantic decoding. Our proposed method outperforms single-subject decoding methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among the existing multi-subject methods on two fMRI datasets. Visualization results provide insights into the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

As compared to BPs with continuous (linear/convex) optimization problems in both levels, the BPs with discrete decision variables have received much less attention, largely due to the ensuing computational intractability and the incapability of gradient-based algorithms for handling discrete optimization formulations. In this paper, we develop deep learning techniques to address this challenge. Specifically, we consider a BP with binary tender, wherein the upper and lower levels are linked via binary variables. We train a neural network to approximate the optimal value of the lower-level problem, as a function of the binary tender. Then, we obtain a single-level reformulation of the BP through a mixed-integer representation of the value function. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis between two types of neural networks: general neural networks and the novel input supermodular neural networks, studying their representational capacities.},

  abstract = {Contrastive learning has emerged as a popular paradigm of self-supervised learning that learns representations by encouraging representations of positive pairs to be similar while representations of negative pairs to be far apart. The spectral contrastive loss, in synergy with the notion of positive-pair graphs, offers valuable theoretical insights into the empirical successes of contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose incorporating an additive factor into the term of spectral contrastive loss involving negative pairs. This simple modification can be equivalently viewed as introducing a regularization term that enforces the mean of representations to be zero, which thus is referred to as zero-mean regularization. It intuitively relaxes the orthogonality of representations between negative pairs and implicitly alleviates the adverse effect of wrong connections in the positive-pair graph, leading to better performance and robustness. To clarify this, we thoroughly investigate the role of zero-mean regularized spectral contrastive loss in both unsupervised and supervised scenarios with respect to theoretical analysis and quantitative evaluation. These results highlight the potential of zero-mean regularized spectral contrastive learning to be a promising approach in various tasks.},

In our work, we propose Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models (DDBMs), a natural alternative to this paradigm based on diffusion bridges, a family of processes that interpolate between two paired distributions given as endpoints. Our method learns the score of the diffusion bridge from data and maps from one endpoint distribution to the other by solving a (stochastic) differential equation based on the learned score.},

However, identifying a compact draft model that is well-aligned with the target model is challenging. To tackle this issue, we propose DistillSpec that uses knowledge distillation to better align the draft model with the target model, before applying SD. DistillSpec makes two key design choices, which we demonstrate via systematic study to be crucial to improve the draft and target alignment: utilizing on-policy data generation from the draft model, and tailoring the divergence function to the task and decoding strategy. Notably, DistillSpec yields impressive 10-45\% speedups over standard SD on a range of standard benchmarks, using both greedy and non-greedy sampling.},

The inherent complexity of real-world data makes it unfeasible to exhaustively enumerate and encapsulate all its variations within a finite set of factors. However, it is worth noting that most real-world data have linguistic equivalents, typically in the form of textual descriptions. These linguistic counterparts can represent the data and effortlessly decomposed into distinct tokens. In light of this, we present Vocabulary Disentangled Retrieval (VDR), a retrieval-based framework that harnesses natural language as proxies of the underlying data variation to drive disentangled representation learning. Our approach employ a bi-encoder model to represent both data and natural language in a vocabulary space, enabling the model to distinguish dimensions that capture intrinsic characteristics within data through its natural language counterpart, thus facilitating disentanglement.},

In this paper, we introduce Variance-enlarged Poisson Learning (VPL), a simple yet powerful framework tailored to alleviate the issues arising from the presence of degenerate solutions. VPL incorporates a variance-enlarged regularization term, which induces a Poisson equation specifically for unlabeled data. Furthermore, we broaden the scope of VPL to encompass graph neural networks, introducing Variance-enlarged Graph Poisson Networks (V-GPN) to facilitate improved label propagation. To achieve a deeper understanding of VPL's behavior, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical exploration in both discrete and variational cases. Our findings elucidate that VPL inherently amplifies the importance of connections within the same class while concurrently tempering those between different classes. We support our claims with extensive experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of VPL and showcasing its superiority over existing methods.},

@inproceedings{zhou2024anomalyclip,
  abstract = {Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) requires detection models trained using auxiliary data to detect anomalies without any training sample in a target dataset. It is a crucial task when training data is not accessible due to various concerns, e.g., data privacy, yet it is challenging since the models need to generalize to anomalies across different domains where the appearance of foreground objects, abnormal regions, and background features, such as defects/tumors on different products/organs, can vary significantly. Recently large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong zero-shot recognition ability in various vision tasks, including anomaly detection. The key insight of AnomalyCLIP is to learn object-agnostic text prompts that capture generic normality and abnormality in an image regardless of its foreground objects. This allows our model to focus on the abnormal image regions rather than the object semantics, enabling generalized normality and abnormality recognition on diverse types of objects. Large-scale experiments on 17 real-world anomaly detection datasets show that AnomalyCLIP achieves superior zero-shot performance of detecting and segmenting anomalies in datasets of highly diverse class semantics from various defect inspection and medical imaging domains.},

  abstract = {Hybrid RL is the setting where an RL agent has access to both offline data and online data by interacting with the real-world environment. In this work, we propose a new hybrid RL algorithm that combines an on-policy actor-critic method with offline data. On-policy methods such as policy gradient and natural policy gradient (NPG) have shown to be more robust to model misspecification, though sometimes it may not be as sample efficient as methods that rely on off-policy learning. On the other hand, offline methods that depend on off-policy training often require strong assumptions in theory and are less stable to train in practice. Our new approach integrates a procedure of off-policy training on the offline data into an on-policy NPG framework. The paper shows that their approach can obtain a "best-of-both-worlds" result - it achieves the state-of-the-art theoretical guarantees of offline RL when offline RL-specific assumptions hold, while maintaining the theoretical guarantees of on-policy NPG regardless of the offline RL assumptions' validity. Experimentally, in challenging rich-observation environments, the approach outperforms a state-of-the-art hybrid RL baseline which only relies on off-policy policy optimization.},

Its long history and numerous applications notwithstanding, inference of phylogenetic trees from sequence data remains challenging: the high complexity of tree space poses a significant obstacle for the current combinatorial and probabilistic techniques. We adopt the framework of generative flow networks ({GFlowNets}) to tackle two core problems in phylogenetics: parsimony-based and Bayesian phylogenetic inference. Because {GFlowNets} are well-suited for sampling complex combinatorial structures, they are a natural choice for exploring and sampling from the multimodal posterior distribution over tree topologies and evolutionary distances. {PhyloGFN} produces diverse and high-quality evolutionary hypotheses on real benchmark datasets. {PhyloGFN} is competitive with prior works in marginal likelihood estimation and achieves a closer fit to the target distribution than state-of-the-art variational inference methods.},

@inproceedings{zhou2024less,
  abstract = {To deduce new facts on a knowledge graph ({KG}), a link predictor learns from the graph structure and collects local evidence to find the answer to a given query. However, existing methods suffer from a severe scalability problem due to the utilization of the whole {KG} for prediction, which hinders their promise on large scale {KGs} and cannot be directly addressed by vanilla sampling methods. In this paper, we propose the one-shot-subgraph link prediction to achieve efficient and adaptive prediction. The design principle is that, instead of directly acting on the whole {KG}, the prediction procedure is decoupled into two steps, i.e., (i) extracting only one subgraph according to the query and (ii) predicting on this single, query dependent subgraph. We reveal that the non-parametric and computation-efficient heuristics Personalized {PageRank} ({PPR}) can effectively identify the potential answers and supporting evidence. With efficient subgraph-based prediction, we further introduce the automated searching of the optimal configurations in both data and model spaces. Empirically, we achieve promoted efficiency and leading performances on five large-scale benchmarks.},

@inproceedings{zhou2024free,
  abstract = {Off-policy dynamic programming ({DP}) techniques such as $Q$-learning have proven to be important in sequential decision-making problems. In the presence of function approximation, however, these techniques often diverge due to the absence of {Bellman} completeness in the function classes considered, a crucial condition for the success of {DP}-based methods. In this paper, we show how off-policy learning techniques based on return-conditioned supervised learning ({RCSL}) are able to circumvent these challenges of {Bellman} completeness. We prove there exists a natural environment in which if one uses two-layer multilayer perceptron as the function approximator, the layer width needs to grow linearly with the state space size to satisfy {Bellman} completeness while a constant layer width is enough for {RCSL}. These findings take a step towards explaining the superior empirical performance of {RCSL} methods compared to {DP}-based methods in environments with near-optimal datasets. Furthermore, in order to learn from sub-optimal datasets, we propose a simple framework called {MBRCSL}, granting {RCSL} methods the ability of dynamic programming to stitch together segments from distinct trajectories. {MBRCSL} leverages learned dynamics models and forward sampling to accomplish trajectory stitching while avoiding the need for {Bellman} completeness that plagues all dynamic programming algorithms.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models ({LLMs}) are trained with a pre-defined context length, restricting their use in scenarios requiring long inputs. Previous efforts for adapting {LLMs} to a longer length usually requires fine-tuning with this target length (Full-length fine-tuning), suffering intensive training cost. To decouple train length from target length for efficient context window extension, we propose Positional Skip-wise ({PoSE}) training that smartly simulates long inputs using a fixed context window. This is achieved by first dividing the original context window into several chunks, then designing distinct skipping bias terms to manipulate the position indices of each chunk. These bias terms and the lengths of each chunk are altered for every training example, allowing the model to adapt to all positions within target length. Experimental results show that {PoSE} greatly reduces memory and time overhead compared with Full-length fine-tuning, with minimal impact on performance.},

  abstract = {Vision Transformers ({ViTs}) have been widely used in various domains. Similar to Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}), {ViTs} are prone to the impacts of adversarial samples, raising security concerns in real-world applications. As one of the most effective black-box attack methods, transferable attacks can generate adversarial samples on surrogate models to directly attack the target model without accessing the parameters. However, due to the distinct internal structures of {ViTs} and {CNNs}, adversarial samples constructed by traditional transferable attack methods may not be applicable to {ViTs}. Therefore, it is imperative to propose more effective transferability attack methods to unveil latent vulnerabilities in {ViTs}. Existing methods have found that applying gradient regularization to extreme gradients across different functional regions in the transformer structure can enhance sample transferability. However, in practice, substantial gradient disparities exist even within the same functional region across different layers. Furthermore, we find that mild gradients therein are the main culprits behind reduced transferability. In this paper, we introduce a novel Gradient Normalization Scaling method for fine-grained gradient editing to enhance the transferability of adversarial attacks on {ViTs}. More importantly, we highlight that {ViTs}, unlike traditional {CNNs}, exhibit distinct attention regions in the frequency domain. Leveraging this insight, we delve into exploring the frequency domain to further enhance the algorithm's transferability.},

These features are rarely observed in previous vision-language models. However, the technical details behind {GPT-4} continue to remain undisclosed. We believe that the enhanced multi-modal generation capabilities of {GPT-4} stem from the utilization of sophisticated large language models ({LLM}). To examine this phenomenon, we present {MiniGPT-4}, which aligns a frozen visual encoder with a frozen {LLM}, Vicuna, using just one projection layer. Our findings reveal that {MiniGPT-4} possesses many capabilities similar to those exhibited by {GPT-4} like detailed image description generation and website creation from hand-written drafts. Furthermore, we also observe other emerging capabilities in {MiniGPT-4}, including writing stories and poems inspired by given images, teaching users how to cook based on food photos, and so on. In our experiment, we found that the model trained on short image caption pairs could produce unnatural language outputs (e.g., repetition and fragmentation). To address this problem, we curate a detailed image description dataset in the second stage to finetune the model, which consequently improves the model's generation reliability and overall usability.},

We evaluate various {LLMs} ranging from Flan-T5-large to {GPT-3.5-Turbo} and {GPT-4}. Experiments show that {LLMs} perform worse in {DyVal}-generated evaluation samples with different complexities, highlighting the significance of dynamic evaluation. We also analyze the failure cases and results of different prompting methods. Moreover, {DyVal}-generated samples are not only evaluation sets, but also helpful data for fine-tuning to improve the performance of {LLMs} on existing benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Spiking neural networks ({SNNs}), attributed to the binary, event-driven nature of spikes, possess heightened biological plausibility and enhanced energy efficiency on neuromorphic hardware compared to analog neural networks ({ANNs}). Mainstream {SNN} training schemes apply backpropagation-through-time ({BPTT}) with surrogate gradients to replace the non-differentiable spike emitting process during backpropagation. While achieving competitive performance, the requirement for storing intermediate information at all time-steps incurs higher memory consumption and fails to fulfill the online property crucial to biological brains. Our work focuses on online training techniques, aiming for memory efficiency while preserving biological plausibility. The limitation of not having access to future information in early time steps in online training has constrained previous efforts to incorporate advantageous modules such as batch normalization. To address this problem, we propose Online Spiking Renormalization ({OSR}) to ensure consistent parameters between testing and training, and Online Threshold Stabilizer ({OTS}) to stabilize neuron firing rates across time steps. Furthermore, we design a novel online approach to compute the sample mean and variance over time for {OSR}. Experiments conducted on various datasets demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance among {SNN} online training algorithms.},

Existing research in the non-interactive and sequentially interactive local models has focused on obtaining the lower bounds for the case where the underlying parameter is 1-sparse, and extending such bounds to the more general $k$-sparse case has proven to be challenging. Moreover, it is unclear whether efficient non-interactive {LDP} ({NLDP}) algorithms exist. To address these issues, we first consider the problem in the $\epsilon$ non-interactive {LDP} model and provide a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{dk \log d}/(\sqrt{n} \epsilon))$ on the $\ell_2$-norm estimation error for sub-Gaussian data, where $n$ is the sample size and $d$ is the dimension of the space. We then propose an innovative {NLDP} algorithm, the very first of its kind for the problem. As a remarkable outcome, this algorithm also yields a novel and highly efficient estimator as a valuable by-product. We further present a sequentially interactive {LDP} algorithm with an improved convergence rate. Finally, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that our proposed algorithms outperform existing baselines.},

  abstract = {The video-language (VL) pretraining has achieved remarkable improvement in multiple downstream tasks. However, the current VL pretraining framework is hard to extend to multiple modalities (N modalities, N ≥ 3) beyond vision and language. We thus propose LanguageBind, taking the language as the bind across different modalities because the language modality is well-explored and contains rich semantics. Specifically, we freeze the language encoder acquired by VL pretraining and then train encoders for other modalities with contrastive learning. As a result, all modalities are mapped to a shared feature space, implementing multi-modal semantic alignment. While LanguageBind ensures that we can extend VL modalities to N modalities, we also need a high-quality dataset with alignment data pairs centered on language. We thus propose VIDAL-10M with 10 Million data with Video, Infrared, Depth, Audio and their corresponding Language. In our VIDAL-10M, all videos are from short video platforms with complete semantics rather than truncated segments from long videos, and all the video, depth, infrared, and audio modalities are aligned to their textual descriptions. LanguageBind has achieved superior performance on a wide range of 15 benchmarks covering video, audio, depth, and infrared. Moreover, multiple experiments have provided evidence for the effectiveness of LanguageBind in achieving indirect alignment and complementarity among diverse modalities.},

  abstract = {The advancements in automatic text-to-3D generation have been remarkable. Most existing methods use pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to optimize 3D representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) via latent-space denoising score matching. Yet, these methods often result in artifacts and inconsistencies across different views due to their suboptimal optimization approaches and limited understanding of 3D geometry. Moreover, the inherent constraints of NeRFs in rendering crisp geometry and stable textures usually lead to a two-stage optimization to attain high-resolution details. This work proposes holistic sampling and smoothing approaches to achieve high-quality text-to-3D generation, all in a single-stage optimization.},

  abstract = {The role of data in building AI systems has recently been emphasized by the emerging concept of data-centric AI. Unfortunately, in the real-world, datasets may contain dirty samples, such as poisoned samples from backdoor attack, noisy labels in crowdsourcing, and even hybrids of them. The presence of such dirty samples makes the DNNs vulnerable and unreliable. We find a commonality of various dirty samples is visual-linguistic inconsistency between images and associated labels. To capture the semantic inconsistency between modalities, we propose versatile data cleanser (VDC) leveraging the surpassing capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLM) in cross-modal alignment and reasoning. It consists of three consecutive modules: the visual question generation module to generate insightful questions about the image; the visual question answering module to acquire the semantics of the visual content by answering the questions with MLLM; followed by the visual answer evaluation module to evaluate the inconsistency.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful decision-making and planning capabilities in solving complicated real-world problems. LLM-based autonomous agents can interact with diverse tools (e.g., functional APIs) and generate solution plans that execute a series of API function calls in a step-by-step manner. The multitude of candidate API function calls significantly expands the action space, amplifying the critical need for efficient action space navigation. However, existing methods either struggle with unidirectional exploration in expansive action spaces, trapped into a locally optimal solution, or suffer from exhaustively traversing all potential actions, causing inefficient navigation. To address these issues, we propose ToolChain*, an efficient tree search-based planning algorithm for LLM-based agents. It formulates the entire action space as a decision tree, where each node represents a possible API function call involved in a solution plan. By incorporating the A* search algorithm with task-specific cost function design, it efficiently prunes high-cost branches that may involve incorrect actions, identifying the most low-cost valid path as the solution.},

Recently, semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have been proposed for solving the K-means optimization problem, which enjoy strong statistical optimality guarantees. However, the prohibitive cost of implementing an SDP solver renders these guarantees inaccessible to practical datasets. In contrast, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a simple clustering algorithm widely used by machine learning practitioners, but it lacks a solid statistical underpinning and theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we consider an NMF-like algorithm that solves a nonnegative low-rank restriction of the SDP-relaxed K-means formulation using a nonconvex Burer-Monteiro factorization approach. The resulting algorithm is as simple and scalable as state-of-the-art NMF algorithms while also enjoying the same strong statistical optimality guarantees.},

Nevertheless, FL encounters challenges due to non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d) data, leading to potential performance degradation and hindered convergence. While prior studies predominantly addressed the issue of skewed label distribution, our research addresses a crucial yet frequently overlooked problem known as multi-domain FL. In this scenario, clients' data originate from diverse domains with distinct feature distributions, instead of label distributions. To address the multi-domain problem in FL, we propose a novel method called Federated Learning Without Normalizations (FedWon). The approach draws inspiration from the observation that batch normalization (BN) faces challenges in effectively modeling the statistics of multiple domains, while existing normalization techniques possess their own limitations. FedWon eliminates the normalization layers in FL and reparameterizes convolution layers with scaled weight standardization.},

Based on this insight, we design an efficient backdoor attack for federated learning that focuses on poisoning BC layers.

@inproceedings{zhuo2024partitioning,
  abstract = {Label imbalance and homophily-heterophily mixture are the fundamental problems encountered when applying Graph Neural Networks ({GNN}s) to Graph Fraud Detection ({GFD}) tasks. Existing {GNN}-based {GFD} models are designed to augment graph structure to accommodate the inductive bias of {GNN}s towards homophily, by excluding heterophilic neighbors during message passing. In our work, we argue that the key to applying {GNN}s for {GFD} is not to exclude but to distinguish neighbors with different labels. Grounded in this perspective, we introduce Partitioning Message Passing ({PMP}), an intuitive yet effective message passing paradigm expressly crafted for {GFD}. Specifically, in the neighbor aggregation stage of {PMP}, neighbors with different classes are aggregated with distinct node-specific aggregation functions. By this means, the center node can adaptively adjust the information aggregated from its heterophilic and homophilic neighbors, thus avoiding the model gradient being dominated by benign nodes which occupy the majority of the population. We theoretically establish a connection between the spatial formulation of {PMP} and spectral analysis to characterize that {PMP} operates an adaptive node-specific spectral graph filter, which demonstrates the capability of {PMP} to handle heterophily-homophily mixed graphs. Extensive experimental results show that {PMP} can significantly boost the performance on {GFD} tasks.},

@inproceedings{zimmer2024sparse,
  abstract = {Neural networks can be significantly compressed by pruning, yielding sparse models with reduced storage and computational demands while preserving predictive performance. Model soups (Wortsman et al., 2022) enhance generalization and out-of-distribution ({OOD}) performance by averaging the parameters of multiple models into a single one, without increasing inference time. However, achieving both sparsity and parameter averaging is challenging as averaging arbitrary sparse models reduces the overall sparsity due to differing sparse connectivities. This work addresses these challenges by demonstrating that exploring a single retraining phase of Iterative Magnitude Pruning ({IMP}) with varied hyperparameter configurations such as batch ordering or weight decay yields models suitable for averaging, sharing identical sparse connectivity by design. Averaging these models significantly enhances generalization and {OOD} performance over their individual counterparts. Building on this, we introduce Sparse Model Soups ({SMS}), a novel method for merging sparse models by initiating each prune-retrain cycle with the averaged model from the previous phase. {SMS} preserves sparsity, exploits sparse network benefits, is modular and fully parallelizable, and substantially improves {IMP}'s performance. We further demonstrate that {SMS} can be adapted to enhance state-of-the-art pruning-during-training approaches.},

Unlike prior work, {MAGNeT} is comprised of a single-stage, non-autoregressive transformer. During training, we predict spans of masked tokens obtained from a masking scheduler, while during inference we gradually construct the output sequence using several decoding steps. To further enhance the quality of the generated audio, we introduce a novel rescoring method in which, we leverage an external pre-trained model to rescore and rank predictions from {MAGNeT}, which will be then used for later decoding steps. Lastly, we explore a hybrid version of {MAGNeT}, in which we fuse between autoregressive and non-autoregressive models to generate the first few seconds in an autoregressive manner. We demonstrate the efficiency of {MAGNeT} for the task of text-to-music and text-to-audio generation and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering both objective metrics and human studies. The proposed approach is comparable to the evaluated baselines, while being significantly faster (7x faster than the autoregressive baseline). Through ablation studies and analysis, we shed light on the importance of each of the components comprising {MAGNeT}, together with pointing to the trade-offs between autoregressive and non-autoregressive modeling, considering latency, throughput, and generation quality.},

While it may be tempting to simply choose a prompt based on average performance on a validation set, this can lead to a deployment where unexpectedly poor responses are generated, especially for the worst-off users. To mitigate this prospect, we propose Prompt Risk Control, a lightweight framework for selecting a prompt based on rigorous upper bounds on families of informative risk measures. We offer methods for producing bounds on a diverse set of metrics, including quantities that measure worst-case responses and disparities in generation quality across the population of users. In addition, we extend the underlying statistical bounding techniques to accommodate the possibility of distribution shifts in deployment. Experiments on applications such as open-ended chat, medical question summarization, and code generation highlight how such a framework can foster responsible deployment by reducing the risk of the worst outcomes.},

@inproceedings{zou2024towards,
  abstract = {Generalizing to out-of-distribution ({OOD}) data or unseen domain, termed {OOD} generalization, still lacks appropriate theoretical guarantees. Canonical {OOD} bounds focus on different distance measurements between source and target domains but fail to consider the optimization property of the learned model. As empirically shown in recent work, the sharpness of learned minima influences {OOD} generalization. To bridge this gap between optimization and {OOD} generalization, we study the effect of sharpness on how a model tolerates data change in domain shift which is usually captured by ``robustness'' in generalization. In this paper, we give a rigorous connection between sharpness and robustness, which gives better {OOD} guarantees for robust algorithms. It also provides a theoretical backing for ``flat minima leads to better {OOD} generalization''. We propose a sharpness-based {OOD} generalization bound by taking robustness into consideration, resulting in a tighter bound than non-robust guarantees.},

In recent years, causal inference methods have been increasingly used in fair machine learning to measure unfairness by causal effects. However, current methods assume that the true causal graph is given, which is often not true in real-world applications. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a framework for achieving causal fairness based on the notion of interventions when the true causal graph is partially known. The proposed approach involves modeling fair prediction using a Partially Directed Acyclic Graph ({PDAG}), specifically, a class of causal {DAG}s that can be learned from observational data combined with domain knowledge. The {PDAG} is used to measure causal fairness, and a constrained optimization problem is formulated to balance between fairness and accuracy. Results on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.},
