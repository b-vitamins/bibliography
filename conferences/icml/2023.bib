  abstract     = {In goal-reaching reinforcement learning (RL), the optimal value function has a particular geometry, called quasimetrics structure. This paper introduces Quasimetric Reinforcement Learning (QRL), a new RL method that utilizes quasimetric models to learn optimal value functions. Distinct from prior approaches, the QRL objective is specifically designed for quasimetrics, and provides strong theoretical recovery guarantees. Empirically, we conduct thorough analyses on a discretized MountainCar environment, identifying properties of QRL and its advantages over alternatives. On offline and online goal-reaching benchmarks, QRL also demonstrates improved sample efficiency and performance, across both state-based and image-based observations.},

  abstract     = {Certified_Watermarks is the first to provide a watermark certificate against $l_2$-norm watermark removal attacks, by leveraging the randomized smoothing techniques for certified robustness to adversarial attacks. However, the randomized smoothing techniques suffer from hardness of certified robustness in high-dimensional space against $l_p$-norm attacks for large $p$ ($p>2$). The certified watermark method based on the randomized smoothing is no exception, i.e., fails to provide meaningful certificates in high-dimensional space against the $l_p$-norm watermark removal attacks ($p>2$). By leveraging mollifier theory, this paper proposes a mollifier smoothing method with dimension-independent certified radius of our proposed smooth classifier, for conducting the certified watermark problem against the $l_p$-norm watermark removal attacks ($1 \leq p \leq \infty$) for high parameter dimension $d$. Based on partial differential equation (PDE) theory, an approximation of mollifier smoothing is developed to alleviate the inefficiency of sampling and prediction in the randomized smoothing as well as numerical integration in the mollifier smoothing, while maintaining the certified watermark against the $l_p$-norm watermark removal attacks ($1 \leq p \leq \infty$).},

  abstract     = {The non-Euclidean geometry of hyperbolic spaces has recently garnered considerable attention in the realm of representation learning. Current endeavors in hyperbolic representation largely presuppose that the underlying hierarchies can be automatically inferred and preserved through the adaptive optimization process. This assumption, however, is questionable and requires further validation. In this work, we first introduce a position-tracking mechanism to scrutinize existing prevalent hyperbolic models, revealing that the learned representations are sub-optimal and unsatisfactory. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, hyperbolic informed embedding (HIE), by incorporating cost-free hierarchical information deduced from the hyperbolic distance of the node to the origin (i.e., induced hyperbolic norm) to advance existing hyperbolic models. The proposed method HIE is both task-agnostic and model-agnostic, enabling its seamless integration with a broad spectrum of models and tasks. Extensive experiments across various models and different tasks demonstrate the versatility and adaptability of the proposed method. Remarkably, our method achieves a remarkable improvement of up to 21.4\% compared to the competing baselines.},

  abstract     = {Homotopy optimization is a traditional method to deal with a complicated optimization problem by solving a sequence of easy-to-hard surrogate subproblems. However, this method can be very sensitive to the continuation schedule design and might lead to a suboptimal solution to the original problem. In addition, the intermediate solutions, often ignored by classic homotopy optimization, could be useful for many real-world applications. In this work, we propose a novel model-based approach to learn the whole continuation path for homotopy optimization, which contains infinite intermediate solutions for any surrogate subproblems. Rather than the classic unidirectional easy-to-hard optimization, our method can simultaneously optimize the original problem and all surrogate subproblems in a collaborative manner. The proposed model also supports real-time generation of any intermediate solution, which could be desirable for many applications. Experimental studies on different problems show that our proposed method can significantly improve the performance of homotopy optimization and provide extra helpful information to support better decision-making.},

Previous work on learning-augmented paging has investigated predictions on (i) when the current page will be requested again (reoccurrence predictions), (ii) the current state of the cache in an optimal algorithm (state predictions), (iii) all requests until the current page gets requested again, and (iv) the relative order in which pages are requested. We study learning-augmented paging from the new perspective of requiring the least possible amount of predicted information. More specifically, the predictions obtained alongside each page request are limited to one bit only. We study two variants of such 1-bit predictions: discard predictions indicating whether a page can be safely evicted, and phase predictions indicating whether a page will be requested again within a phase. For both types of predictions, we develop algorithms that are consistent and robust, and we demonstrate that they have near-optimal performance.},

Recent regulatory directives stress the need for FRL methods that provide practical certificates, i.e., provable upper bounds on the unfairness of any downstream classifier trained on preprocessed data, which directly provides assurance in a practical scenario. Creating such FRL methods is an important challenge that remains unsolved. In this work, we address that challenge and introduce FARE (Fairness with Restricted Encoders), the first FRL method with practical fairness certificates. FARE is based on our key insight that restricting the representation space of the encoder enables the derivation of practical guarantees, while still permitting favorable accuracy-fairness tradeoffs for suitable instantiations, such as one we propose based on fair trees.},

Since the performance of each predictor may vary over time, it is desirable to use not the single best predictor as a benchmark, but rather a dynamic combination which follows different predictors at different times. We design algorithms that combine predictions and are competitive against such dynamic combinations for a wide class of online problems, namely, metrical task systems. Against the best (in hindsight) unconstrained combination of $\ell$ predictors, we obtain a competitive ratio of $O(\ell^2)$, and show that this is best possible. However, for a benchmark with slightly constrained number of switches between different predictors, we can get a $(1+\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm. Moreover, our algorithms can be adapted to access predictors in a bandit-like fashion, querying only one predictor at a time.},

We connect and strengthen these results by identifying a variant of first-order logic with counting quantifiers that is simultaneously an upper bound for fixed-precision transformer encoders and a lower bound for transformer encoders. This brings us much closer than before to an exact characterization of the languages that transformer encoders recognize.},

Vision Transformers (ViT) have introduced the same architecture to image and video modelling, but these have not yet been successfully scaled to nearly the same degree; the largest dense ViT contains 4B parameters (Chen et al., 2022). We present a recipe for highly efficient and stable training of a 22B-parameter ViT (ViT-22B) and perform a wide variety of experiments on the resulting model. When evaluated on downstream tasks (often with a lightweight linear model on frozen features), ViT-22B demonstrates increasing performance with scale. We further observe other interesting benefits of scale, including an improved tradeoff between fairness and performance, state-of-the-art alignment to human visual perception in terms of shape/texture bias, and improved robustness. ViT-22B demonstrates the potential for "LLM-like" scaling in vision, and provides key steps towards getting there.},

Here, the 1-{WL} is a well-studied heuristic for the graph isomorphism problem, which iteratively colors or partitions a graph's vertex set. While this connection has led to significant advances in understanding and enhancing {GNN}s' expressive power, it does not provide insights into their generalization performance, i.e., their ability to make meaningful predictions beyond the training set. In this paper, we study {GNN}s' generalization ability through the lens of {Vapnik-Chervonenkis} ({VC}) dimension theory in two settings, focusing on graph-level predictions. First, when no upper bound on the graphs' order is known, we show that the bitlength of {GNN}s' weights tightly bounds their {VC} dimension. Further, we derive an upper bound for {GNN}s' {VC} dimension using the number of colors produced by the 1-{WL}. Secondly, when an upper bound on the graphs' order is known, we show a tight connection between the number of graphs distinguishable by the 1-{WL} and {GNN}s' {VC} dimension.

Controlling the bias and the variance of this estimation is crucial to establish the convergence of learning algorithms. Our first contribution is to design a novel additive smoothing algorithm, the {Parisian} particle {Gibbs} ({PPG}) sampler, which can be viewed as a {PaRIS} ({Olsson}, {Westerborn} 2017) algorithm driven by conditional {SMC} moves, resulting in bias-reduced estimates of the targeted quantities. We substantiate the {PPG} algorithm with theoretical results, including new bounds on bias and variance as well as deviation inequalities. We then establish, in the learning context, and under standard assumptions, non-asymptotic bounds highlighting the value of bias reduction and the implicit {Rao--Blackwellization} of {PPG}. These are the first non-asymptotic results of this kind in this setting. We illustrate our theoretical results with numerical experiments supporting our claims.},

The training dynamics of models with {DP} show a significant difference from standard training, whereas understanding the geometric properties of private learning remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate sharpness, a key factor in achieving better generalization, in private learning. We show that flat minima can help reduce the negative effects of per-example gradient clipping and the addition of {Gaussian} noise. We then verify the effectiveness of {Sharpness-Aware Minimization} ({SAM}) for seeking flat minima in private learning. However, we also discover that {SAM} is detrimental to the privacy budget and computational time due to its two-step optimization. Thus, we propose a new sharpness-aware training method that mitigates the privacy-optimization trade-off. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance of deep learning models with {DP} from both scratch and fine-tuning.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new class of online learning algorithms, generalized implicit Follow-The-Regularized-Leader ({FTRL}), that expands the scope of {FTRL} framework. Generalized implicit {FTRL} can recover known algorithms, such as {FTRL} with linearized losses and implicit {FTRL}, and it allows the design of new update rules, as extensions of {aProx} and {Mirror-Prox} to {FTRL}. Our theory is constructive in the sense that it provides a simple unifying framework to design updates that directly improve the worst-case upper bound on the regret. The key idea is substituting the linearization of the losses with a {Fenchel-Young} inequality. We show the flexibility of the framework by proving that some known algorithms, like the {Mirror-Prox} updates, are instantiations of the generalized implicit {FTRL}. Finally, the new framework allows us to recover the temporal variation bound of implicit {OMD}, with the same computational complexity.},

However, actual programs work with machine-representable numbers (e.g., floating-point numbers), not reals. In this paper, we study the correctness of {AD} when the parameter space of a neural network consists solely of machine-representable numbers. In particular, we analyze two sets of parameters on which {AD} can be incorrect: the incorrect set on which the network is differentiable but {AD} does not compute its derivative, and the non-differentiable set on which the network is non-differentiable. For a neural network with bias parameters, we first prove that the incorrect set is always empty. We then prove a tight bound on the size of the non-differentiable set, which is linear in the number of non-differentiabilities in activation functions, and give a simple necessary and sufficient condition for a parameter to be in this set. We further prove that {AD} always computes a {Clarke} subderivative even on the non-differentiable set. We also extend these results to neural networks possibly without bias parameters.},

  abstract     = {Recently, there is an emerging interest in adversarially training a classifier with a rejection option (also known as a selective classifier) for boosting adversarial robustness. While rejection can incur a cost in many applications, existing studies typically associate zero cost with rejecting perturbed inputs, which can result in the rejection of numerous slightly-perturbed inputs that could be correctly classified. In this work, we study adversarially-robust classification with rejection in the stratified rejection setting, where the rejection cost is modeled by rejection loss functions monotonically non-increasing in the perturbation magnitude. We theoretically analyze the stratified rejection setting and propose a novel defense method -- Adversarial Training with Consistent Prediction-based Rejection ({CPR}) -- for building a robust selective classifier. Experiments on image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods under strong adaptive attacks. For instance, on {CIFAR}-10, {CPR} reduces the total robust loss (for different rejection losses) by at least 7.3\% under both seen and unseen attacks.},

By re-examining the characteristics possessed by advanced image restoration algorithms, we discover several key factors leading to the performance improvement of restoration models. This motivates us to develop a novel network for image restoration based on cheap convolution operators.

  abstract     = {Many modern high-performing machine learning models increasingly rely on scaling up models, e.g., transformer networks. Simultaneously, a parallel line of work aims to improve the model performance by augmenting an input instance with other (labeled) instances during inference. Examples of such augmentations include task-specific prompts and similar examples retrieved from the training data by a nonparametric component. Despite a growing literature showcasing the promise of these retrieval-based models, their theoretical underpinnings remain under-explored. In this paper, we present a formal treatment of retrieval-based models to characterize their performance via a novel statistical perspective. In particular, we study two broad classes of retrieval-based classification approaches: First, we analyze a local learning framework that employs an explicit local empirical risk minimization based on retrieved examples for each input instance. Interestingly, we show that breaking down the underlying learning task into local sub-tasks enables the model to employ a low complexity parametric component to ensure good overall performance. The second class of retrieval-based approaches we explore learns a global model using kernel methods to directly map an input instance and retrieved examples to a prediction, without explicitly solving a local learning task.},

Using overparameterized factor representations, ScaledGD($\lambda$) starts from a small random initialization and proceeds by gradient descent with a specific form of damped preconditioning to combat bad curvatures induced by overparameterization and ill-conditioning. We show that under the Gaussian design, ScaledGD($\lambda$) converges to the true low-rank matrix at a constant linear rate after a small number of iterations that scales only logarithmically with respect to the condition number and the problem dimension. At the expense of light computational overhead incurred by preconditioners, ScaledGD($\lambda$) is remarkably robust to ill-conditioning compared to vanilla gradient descent (GD) even with overparameterization. This significantly improves over the convergence rate of vanilla GD which suffers from a polynomial dependency on the condition number.},

The key to missing value imputation is to capture the data distribution with incomplete samples and impute the missing values accordingly. In this paper, by leveraging the fact that any two batches of data with missing values come from the same data distribution, we propose to impute the missing values of two batches of samples by transforming them into a latent space through deep invertible functions and matching them distributionally. To learn the transformations and impute the missing values simultaneously, a simple and well-motivated algorithm is proposed. Our algorithm has fewer hyperparameters to fine-tune and generates high-quality imputations regardless of how missing values are generated. Extensive experiments over a large number of datasets and competing benchmark algorithms show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

When paired with a parameter-free model based on Pólya's Urn, the worst-case computational and memory complexities scale quasi-linearly and linearly with the number of observed edges, making it efficient on sparse graphs, and requires only integer arithmetic. Key to our method is bits-back coding, which is used to sample edges and vertices without replacement from the edge-list in a way that preserves the structure of the graph. Optimality is proven under a class of random graph models that are invariant to permutations of the edges and of vertices within an edge. Experiments indicate Random Edge Coding can achieve competitive compression performance on real-world network datasets and scales to graphs with millions of nodes and edges.},

Our technique combines minimum-Bayes-risk decoding, dual decomposition, and decision diagrams in order to efficiently produce structured uncertainty summaries, given only sample access to an arbitrary generative model of code and an optional {AST} parser. We demonstrate {R-U-SURE} on three developer-assistance tasks, and show that it can be applied to different user interaction patterns without retraining the model and leads to more accurate uncertainty estimates than token-probability baselines.},

The Adversary cannot occlude ground truth, influence underlying environment dynamics or reward signals, introduce non-stationarity, add stochasticity, see the Victim's actions, or access their parameters. Additionally, we present a simple meta-learning algorithm called Adversarial Cheap Talk ({ACT}) to train Adversaries in this setting. We demonstrate that an Adversary trained with {ACT} still significantly influences the Victim's training and testing performance, despite the highly constrained setting. Affecting train-time performance reveals a new attack vector and provides insight into the success and failure modes of existing {RL} algorithms. More specifically, we show that an {ACT} Adversary is capable of harming performance by interfering with the learner's function approximation, or instead helping the Victim's performance by outputting useful features. Finally, we show that an {ACT} Adversary can manipulate messages during train-time to directly and arbitrarily control the Victim at test-time.},

It has been widely applied in machine learning tasks such as medical diagnosis, drug design, and policymaking. In these common applications, data can be highly sensitive. Differential privacy (DP) offers data analysis tools with powerful worst-case privacy guarantees and has been developed as the leading approach in privacy-preserving data analysis. In this paper, we study Metropolis-Hastings (MH), one of the most fundamental MCMC methods, for large-scale Bayesian inference under differential privacy. While most existing private MCMC algorithms sacrifice accuracy and efficiency to obtain privacy, we provide the first exact and fast DP MH algorithm, using only a minibatch of data in most iterations. We further reveal, for the first time, a three-way trade-off among privacy, scalability (i.e. the batch size), and efficiency (i.e. the convergence rate), theoretically characterizing how privacy affects the utility and computational cost in Bayesian inference. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm in various experiments.},

  abstract     = {Projection maintenance is one of the core data structure tasks. Efficient data structures for projection maintenance have led to recent breakthroughs in many convex programming algorithms. In this work, we further extend this framework to the Kronecker product structure. Given a constraint matrix $\sf A$ and a positive semi-definite matrix $W\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ with a sparse eigenbasis, we consider the task of maintaining the projection in the form of $\sf B^\top(\sf B\sf B^\top)^{-1}\sf B$, where $\sf B=\sf A(W\otimes I)$ or $\sf B=\sf A(W^{1/2}\otimes W^{1/2})$. At each iteration, the weight matrix $W$ receives a low rank change and we receive a new vector $h$. The goal is to maintain the projection matrix and answer the query $\sf B^\top(\sf B\sf B^\top)^{-1}\sf Bh$ with good approximation guarantees. We design a fast dynamic data structure for this task and it is robust against an adaptive adversary. Following the beautiful and pioneering work of [Beimel, Kaplan, Mansour, Nissim, Saranurak and Stemmer, STOC'22], we use tools from differential privacy to reduce the randomness required by the data structure and further improve the running time.},

  abstract     = {Rehearsal-based approaches are a mainstay of continual learning (CL). They mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem by maintaining a small fixed-size buffer with a subset of data from past tasks. While most rehearsal-based approaches study how to effectively exploit the knowledge from the buffered past data, little attention is paid to the inter-task relationships with the critical task-specific and task-invariant knowledge. By appropriately leveraging inter-task relationships, we propose a novel CL method named DualHSIC to boost the performance of existing rehearsal-based methods in a simple yet effective way. DualHSIC consists of two complementary components that stem from the so-called Hilbert Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC): HSIC-Bottleneck for Rehearsal (HBR) lessens the inter-task interference and HSIC Alignment (HA) promotes task-invariant knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments show that DualHSIC can be seamlessly plugged into existing rehearsal-based methods for consistent performance improvements, and also outperforms recent state-of-the-art regularization-enhanced rehearsal methods.

However, many nonconvex machine learning problems do not belong to the class of smooth functions and therefore the existing algorithms are sub-optimal. Instead, these problems have been shown to satisfy certain generalized-smooth conditions, which have not been well understood in the existing literature. In this paper, we propose a notion of $\alpha$-symmetric generalized-smoothness that extends the existing notions and covers many important functions such as high-order polynomials and exponential functions. We study the fundamental properties and establish descent lemmas for the functions in this class. Then, to solve such a large class of nonconvex problems, we design a special deterministic normalized gradient descent algorithm that achieves the optimal iteration complexity $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$, and also prove that the popular SPIDER variance reduction algorithm achieves the optimal sample complexity $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ in the stochastic setting. Our results show that solving generalized-smooth nonconvex problems is as efficient as solving smooth nonconvex problems.},

In particular, diffusion equations have been widely used for designing the core processing layer of GNNs, and therefore they are inevitably vulnerable to the notorious oversmoothing problem. Recently, a couple of papers paid attention to reaction equations in conjunctions with diffusion equations. However, they all consider limited forms of reaction equations. To this end, we present a reaction-diffusion equation-based GNN method that considers all popular types of reaction equations in addition to one special reaction equation designed by us. To our knowledge, our paper is one of the most comprehensive studies on reaction-diffusion equation-based GNNs. In our experiments with 9 datasets and 28 baselines, our method, called GREAD, outperforms them in a majority of cases. Further synthetic data experiments show that it mitigates the oversmoothing problem and works well for various homophily rates.},

However, in many realistic problems, more information is either revealed or can be computed during some point of the learning process. Motivated by diverse applications ranging from robotics to data center scheduling, we formulate a Hindsight Observable Markov Decision Process (HOMDP) as a POMDP where the latent states are revealed to the learner in hindsight and only during training. We introduce new algorithms for the tabular and function approximation settings that are provably sample-efficient with hindsight observability, even in POMDPs that would otherwise be statistically intractable. We give a lower bound showing that the tabular algorithm is optimal in its dependence on latent state and observation cardinalities.},

When agents have identical valuation functions the problem coincides with the semi-online machine covering problem (when items are goods) and load balancing problem (when items are chores), for both of which optimal competitive ratios have been achieved. In this paper, we consider the case when agents have general additive valuation functions. For the allocation of goods, we show that no competitive algorithm exists even when there are only three agents and propose an optimal 0.5-competitive algorithm for the case of two agents. For the allocation of chores, we propose a (2-1/n)-competitive algorithm for n>=3 agents and a square root of 2 (approximately 1.414)-competitive algorithm for two agents. Additionally, we show that no algorithm can do better than 15/11 (approximately 1.364)-competitive for two agents.},

  abstract     = {We propose a hybrid neural network (NN) and PDE approach for learning generalizable PDE dynamics from motion observations. Many NN approaches learn an end-to-end model that implicitly models both the governing PDE and constitutive models (or material models). Without explicit PDE knowledge, these approaches cannot guarantee physical correctness and have limited generalizability. We argue that the governing PDEs are often well-known and should be explicitly enforced rather than learned. Instead, constitutive models are particularly suitable for learning due to their data-fitting nature. To this end, we introduce a new framework termed Neural Constitutive Laws (NCLaw), which utilizes a network architecture that strictly guarantees standard constitutive priors, including rotation equivariance and undeformed state equilibrium. We embed this network inside a differentiable simulation and train the model by minimizing a loss function based on the difference between the simulation and the motion observation. We validate NCLaw on various large-deformation dynamical systems, ranging from solids to fluids. After training on a single motion trajectory, our method generalizes to new geometries, initial/boundary conditions, temporal ranges, and even multi-physics systems. On these extremely out-of-distribution generalization tasks, NCLaw is orders-of-magnitude more accurate than previous NN approaches. Real-world experiments demonstrate our method's ability to learn constitutive laws from videos.},

These agencies are specialized in designing online algorithms and bidding on behalf of their clients. Typically, an agency usually has information on multiple advertisers, so she can potentially coordinate bids to help her clients achieve higher utilities than those under independent bidding. In this work, we study coordinated online bidding algorithms in repeated second-price auctions with budgets. We propose algorithms that guarantee every client a higher utility than the best she can get under independent bidding. We also show that these algorithms achieve maximal social welfare and discuss bidders' incentives to misreport their budgets, in symmetric cases.},

In this paper, we take the first step towards omni-generalizable neural methods for VRPs that generalize across problem sizes and distributions. We propose a meta-learning framework that enables models to quickly adapt to new problem instances with different characteristics. Our approach learns generalizable node and edge representations through a novel architecture that captures both local and global structural patterns in routing problems.},

However, we also demonstrate that this method does not inherently protect data privacy and can be vulnerable to gradient attacks. To address this vulnerability, we show that adding random noise can make the algorithm differentially private, creating a communication-efficient and privacy-preserving approach for federated learning.},

While policy optimization methods with function approximation have shown promising empirical performance, it remains elusive how to design such algorithms with statistical guarantees. In this work, we leverage a multi-agent performance difference lemma that characterizes the landscape of multi-agent policy optimization. We find that the localized action value function serves as an ideal descent direction for each local policy. Based on this observation, we present a multi-agent PPO algorithm where each agent's local policy is updated similarly to vanilla PPO. We prove that with standard regularity conditions on the Markov game and problem-dependent quantities, our algorithm converges to the globally optimal policy at a sublinear rate. This represents the first provably convergent multi-agent PPO algorithm in cooperative Markov games.},

In this work, we propose a novel L2O model with a mathematics-inspired structure that is broadly applicable and generalizes well to out-of-distribution problems. Our model mimics the structure of classical optimization algorithms and leverages their mathematical foundations for better generalization.

These networks are typically trained using the cross-entropy loss, which optimizes for top-$1$ classification and is considered optimal in the case of infinite data. However, in real-world scenarios, data is often noisy and limited, leading to the need for more robust losses. In this paper, we propose using the Weighted Sampling Without Replacement (WSWR) method as a learning objective for top-$k$ loss. While traditional methods for evaluating WSWR-based top-$k$ loss are computationally impractical, we show a novel connection between WSWR and Reinforcement Learning (RL) and apply well-established RL algorithms to estimate gradients. We compared our method with recently proposed top-$k$ losses in various regimes of noise and data size for the prevalent use case of $k = 5$. Our experimental results reveal that our method consistently outperforms all other methods on the top-$k$ metric for noisy datasets, has more robustness on extreme testing scenarios, and achieves competitive results on training with limited data.},

It has a long history in scientific computing and has recently gained popularity in machine learning, particularly in methods that preserve the graph spectrum. The geometric approach is useful when working with a collection of graphs, such as in graph classification and regression. In this study, we consider a graph as an element on a metric space equipped with the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance, and bound the difference between the distance of two graphs and their coarsened versions. Minimizing this difference can be done using the popular weighted kernel K-means method, which improves existing spectrum-preserving methods with the proper choice of the kernel. The study includes a set of experiments to support the theory and method, including approximating the GW distance, preserving the graph spectrum, classifying graphs using spectral information, and performing regression using graph convolutional networks.},

In this work, we hypothesize that the optimal procedure minimizes the length of the path taken when corrupting an image towards a given final state. We propose the Fisher metric for the path length, measured in the space of probability distributions. We show that the shortest path according to this metric corresponds to a combination of image sharpening, rather than blurring, and noise deblurring.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we use Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) as a flexible surrogate for Bayesian Optimization (BO). PFNs are neural processes that are trained to approximate the posterior predictive distribution (PPD) through in-context learning on any prior distribution that can be efficiently sampled from. We describe how this flexibility can be exploited for surrogate modeling in BO. We use PFNs to mimic a naive Gaussian process (GP), an advanced GP, and a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN). In addition, we show how to incorporate further information into the prior, such as allowing hints about the position of optima (user priors), ignoring irrelevant dimensions, and performing non-myopic BO by learning the acquisition function. The flexibility underlying these extensions opens up vast possibilities for using PFNs for BO. We demonstrate the usefulness of PFNs for BO in a large-scale evaluation on artificial GP samples and three different hyperparameter optimization testbeds: HPO-B, Bayesmark, and PD1.},

This paper presents a reward scheme designed using the unique statistical properties that are required by causal inference to guarantee certain desirable incentive criteria (e.g., fairness, benefit) for the parties based on their contributions.

On the theoretical side, a learning theory analysis which is centered around the generalization bound and function approximation error bound (under some specific data distributions) is conducted rigorously.},

To guarantee convergence to a stationary point of a non-convex function, CREST models the non-convex loss as a series of quadratic functions and extracts a coreset for each quadratic sub-region. In addition, to ensure faster convergence of stochastic gradient methods such as (mini-batch) SGD, CREST iteratively extracts multiple mini-batch coresets from larger random subsets of training data, to ensure nearly-unbiased gradients with small variances. Finally, to further improve scalability and efficiency, CREST identifies and excludes the examples that are learned from the coreset selection pipeline. Our extensive experiments on several deep networks trained on vision and NLP datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and SNLI, confirm that CREST speeds up training deep networks on very large datasets, by 1.7x to 2.5x with minimum loss in the performance. By analyzing the learning difficulty of the subsets selected by CREST, we show that deep models benefit the most by learning from subsets of increasing difficulty levels.},

However, mitigating these correlations during pre-training for large-scale models can be costly and impractical, particularly for those without access to high-performance computing resources. This paper proposes a novel approach to address spurious correlations during fine-tuning for a given domain of interest. With a focus on multi-modal models (e.g., CLIP), the proposed method leverages different modalities in these models to detect and explicitly set apart spurious attributes from the affected class, achieved through a multi-modal contrastive loss function that expresses spurious relationships through language. Our experimental results and in-depth visualizations on CLIP show that such an intervention can effectively i) improve the model's accuracy when spurious attributes are not present, and ii) directs the model's activation maps towards the actual class rather than the spurious attribute when present. In particular, on the Waterbirds dataset, our algorithm achieved a worst-group accuracy 23\% higher than ERM on CLIP with a ResNet-50 backbone, and 32\% higher on CLIP with a ViT backbone, while maintaining the same average accuracy as ERM.},

This can be because our visual system is not like a camera that 'remembers' every pixel. Instead, only part of the information can be perceived with our selective attention, and the brain 'guesses' the rest to form what we think we see. Most existing approaches ignored the brain completion mechanism. In this work, we propose to reconstruct seen images with both the visual perception and the brain completion process, and design a simple, yet effective visual decoding framework to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first construct a shared discrete representation space for both brain signals and images. Then, a novel self-supervised token-to-token inpainting network is designed to implement visual content completion by building context and prior knowledge about the visual objects from the discrete latent space. Our approach improved the quality of visual reconstruction significantly and achieved state-of-the-art.},

Motivated by the emerging demand for latency-insensitive tasks with batched processing, this paper initiates the study of high-throughput LLM inference using limited resources, such as a single commodity GPU. We present FlexGen, a high-throughput generation engine for running LLMs with limited GPU memory. FlexGen can be flexibly configured under various hardware resource constraints by aggregating memory and computation from the GPU, CPU, and disk. By solving a linear programming problem, it searches for efficient patterns to store and access tensors. FlexGen further compresses the weights and the attention cache to 4 bits with negligible accuracy loss. These techniques enable FlexGen to have a larger space of batch size choices and thus significantly increase maximum throughput. As a result, when running OPT-175B on a single 16GB GPU, FlexGen achieves significantly higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art offloading systems, reaching a generation throughput of 1 token/s for the first time with an effective batch size of 144. On the HELM benchmark, FlexGen can benchmark a 30B model with a 16GB GPU on 7 representative sub-scenarios in 21 hours.},

  abstract     = {Deep graph clustering, which aims to group the nodes of a graph into disjoint clusters with deep neural networks, has achieved promising progress in recent years. However, the existing methods fail to scale to the large graph with million nodes. To solve this problem, a scalable deep graph clustering method (Dink-Net) is proposed with the idea of dilation and shrink. Firstly, by discriminating nodes, whether being corrupted by augmentations, representations are learned in a self-supervised manner. Meanwhile, the cluster centres are initialized as learnable neural parameters. Subsequently, the clustering distribution is optimized by minimizing the proposed cluster dilation loss and cluster shrink loss in an adversarial manner. By these settings, we unify the two-step clustering, i.e., representation learning and clustering optimization, into an end-to-end framework, guiding the network to learn clustering-friendly features. Besides, Dink-Net scales well to large graphs since the designed loss functions adopt the mini-batch data to optimize the clustering distribution even without performance drops. Both experimental results and theoretical analyses demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared to the runner-up, Dink-Net achieves 9.62\% NMI improvement on the ogbn-papers100M dataset with 111 million nodes and 1.6 billion edges.},

This paper considers a general setting where the guidance is defined by an (unnormalized) energy function. The main challenge for this setting is that the intermediate guidance during the diffusion sampling procedure, which is jointly defined by the sampling distribution and the energy function, is unknown and is hard to estimate. To address this challenge, we propose an exact formulation of the intermediate guidance as well as a novel training objective named contrastive energy prediction (CEP) to learn the exact guidance. Our method is guaranteed to converge to the exact guidance under unlimited model capacity and data samples, while previous methods can not. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to offline reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms. We also provide some examples of applying CEP for image synthesis to demonstrate the scalability of CEP on high-dimensional data.},

  abstract     = {Gradient Descent (GD) is a powerful workhorse of modern machine learning thanks to its scalability and efficiency in high-dimensional spaces. Its ability to find local minimizers is only guaranteed for losses with Lipschitz gradients, where it can be seen as a 'bona-fide' discretization of an underlying gradient flow. Yet, many ML setups involving overparametrized models do not fall into this problem class, which has motivated research beyond the so-called "Edge of Stability" (EoS), where the step-size crosses the admissibility threshold inversely proportional to the Lipschitz constant above. Perhaps surprisingly, GD has been empirically observed to still converge regardless of local instability and oscillatory behavior. The incipient theoretical analysis of this phenomena has mainly focused in the overparametrized regime, where the effect of choosing a large learning rate may be associated to a 'Sharpness-Minimization' implicit regularization within the manifold of minimizers, under appropriate asymptotic limits. In contrast, in this work we directly examine the conditions for such unstable convergence, focusing on simple, yet representative, learning problems, via analysis of two-step gradient updates. Specifically, we characterize a local condition involving third-order derivatives that guarantees existence and convergence to fixed points of the two-step updates, and leverage such property in a teacher-student setting, under population loss. Finally, starting from Matrix Factorization, we provide observations of period-2 orbit of GD in high-dimensional settings with intuition of its dynamics, along with exploration into more general settings.},

To address this issue, we propose the Cooperative Open-ended Learning (COLE) framework, which constructs open-ended objectives in cooperative games with two players from the perspective of graph theory to assess and identify the cooperative ability of each strategy. We further specify the framework and propose a practical algorithm that leverages knowledge from game theory and graph theory. An analysis of the learning process of the algorithm shows that it can efficiently overcome cooperative incompatibility. The experimental results in the Overcooked game environment demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods when coordinating with different-level partners.},

Their main result is the first data structure that, given a sublinear (in $n$) number of samples from $p$, identifies $v_i$ in time sublinear in $k$. They also give an improved version of the algorithm of Acharya et al. (2018) that reports $v_i$ in time linear in $k$. The experimental evaluation of the latter algorithm shows that it achieves a significant reduction in the number of operations needed to achieve a given accuracy compared to prior work.},

In contrast to unweighted correlation clustering we allow for a more expressive weighted cost structure. In dense multicut, the clustering objective is given in a factorized form as inner products of node feature vectors. This allows for an efficient formulation and inference in contrast to multicut/weighted correlation clustering, which has at least quadratic representation and computation complexity when working on the complete graph.},

This is motivated by the fact that the rich combinatorial nature of data in certain reasoning tasks (e.g., arithmetic/logic) makes representative data sampling challenging, and learning successfully under GOTU gives a first vignette of an 'extrapolating' or 'reasoning' learner. The authors study how different network architectures trained by (S)GD perform under GOTU and provide both theoretical and experimental evidence that for a class of network models including instances of Transformers, random features models, and diagonal linear networks, a min-degree-interpolator is learned on the unseen. The min-degree-interpolator means an interpolator of the training data that has minimal Fourier mass on the higher degree basis elements. These findings lead to two implications: (1) an explanation to the length generalization problem for Boolean functions; (2) the introduction of a curriculum learning algorithm called Degree-Curriculum that learns monomials more efficiently by incrementing supports.},

The interest in kernel machines has been additionally bolstered by the discovery of their equivalence to wide neural networks in certain regimes. However, a key feature of DNNs is their ability to scale the model size and training data size independently, whereas in traditional kernel machines model size is tied to data size. Because of this coupling, scaling kernel machines to large data has been computationally challenging. In this paper, we provide a way forward for constructing large-scale general kernel models, which are a generalization of kernel machines that decouples the model and data, allowing training on large datasets. Specifically, we introduce EigenPro 3.0, an algorithm based on projected dual preconditioned SGD and show scaling to model and data sizes which have not been possible with existing kernel methods.},

We provide here new algorithms that explicitly consider and adapt to the relationship between problem instances and experts' knowledge. We first propose and highlight the drawbacks of a naive approach based on nearest neighbor queries. To address these drawbacks we then introduce a novel algorithm - expertise trees - that constructs decision trees enabling the learner to select appropriate models. We provide theoretical insights and empirically validate the improved performance of our novel approach on a range of problems for which existing methods proved to be inadequate.},

In addition to Machine Learning based-models, nonparametric estimators called meta-learners have been developed to estimate the CATE with the main advantage of not restraining the estimation to a specific supervised learning method. This task becomes, however, more complicated when the treatment is not binary as some limitations of the naive extensions emerge. This paper looks into meta-learners for estimating the heterogeneous effects of multi-valued treatments. We consider different meta-learners, and we carry out a theoretical analysis of their error upper bounds as functions of important parameters such as the number of treatment levels, showing that the naive extensions do not always provide satisfactory results. We introduce and discuss meta-learners that perform well as the number of treatments increases. We empirically confirm the strengths and weaknesses of those methods with synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.},

Given a compact set of input points $T \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, BNN-DP computes lower and upper bounds on the BNN's predictions for all the points in $T$. The framework is based on an interpretation of BNNs as stochastic dynamical systems, which enables the use of Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithms to bound the prediction range along the layers of the network. Specifically, the method uses bound propagation techniques and convex relaxations to derive a backward recursion procedure to over-approximate the prediction range of the BNN with piecewise affine functions. The algorithm is general and can handle both regression and classification tasks. On a set of experiments on various regression and classification tasks and BNN architectures, we show that BNN-DP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to four orders of magnitude in both tightness of the bounds and computational efficiency.},

Most existing methods rely on observational data and structural assumptions (e.g., conditional independence) to identify the latent factors. However, interventional data is prevalent across applications. Can interventional data facilitate causal representation learning? We explore this question in this paper. The key observation is that interventional data often carries geometric signatures of the latent factors' support (i.e. what values each latent can possibly take). For example, when the latent factors are causally connected, interventions can break the dependency between the intervened latents' support and their ancestors'. Leveraging this fact, we prove that the latent causal factors can be identified up to permutation and scaling given data from perfect do interventions. Moreover, we can achieve block affine identification, namely the estimated latent factors are only entangled with a few other latents if we have access to data from imperfect interventions. These results highlight the unique power of interventional data in causal representation learning; they can enable provable identification of latent factors without any assumptions about their distributions or dependency structure.},

  abstract     = {Instrumental variable (IV) methods are used to estimate causal effects in settings with unobserved confounding, where we cannot directly experiment on the treatment variable. Instruments are variables which only affect the outcome indirectly via the treatment variable(s). Most IV applications focus on low-dimensional treatments and crucially require at least as many instruments as treatments. This assumption is restrictive: in the natural sciences we often seek to infer causal effects of high-dimensional treatments (e.g., the effect of gene expressions or microbiota on health and disease), but can only run few experiments with a limited number of instruments (e.g., drugs or antibiotics). In such under-specified problems, the full treatment effect is not identifiable in a single experiment even in the linear case. We show that one can still reliably recover the projection of the treatment effect onto the instrumented subspace and develop techniques to consistently combine such partial estimates from different sets of instruments. We then leverage our combined estimators in an algorithm that iteratively proposes the most informative instruments at each round of experimentation to maximize the overall information about the full causal effect.},

However, the computational cost of generating results on the entire 57-game dataset limits ALE's use and makes the reproducibility of many results infeasible. We propose a novel solution to this problem in the form of a principled methodology for selecting small but representative subsets of environments within a benchmark suite. We applied our method to identify a subset of five ALE games, we call Atari-5, which produces 57-game median score estimates within 10% of their true values. Extending the subset to 10-games recovers 80% of the variance for log-scores for all games within the 57-game set. We show this level of compression is possible due to a high degree of correlation between many of the games in ALE.},

However, recent developments show that this framework can still suffer from counter-intuitive results. Moreover, specifically for deep visual models, the existing path-based methods also fall short on conforming to the original intuitions that are the basis of the claimed axiomatic properties of this framework. We address these problems with a systematic investigation, and pinpoint the conditions in which the counter-intuitive results can be avoided for deep visual model interpretation with the path attribution strategy. We also devise a scheme to preclude the conditions in which visual model interpretation can invalidate the axiomatic properties of path attribution. These insights are combined into a method that enables reliable visual model interpretation. Our findings are establish empirically with multiple datasets, models and evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments show a consistent performance gain of our method over the baselines.},

We show the worst-case rate of convergence $\tilde{O}(t^{-1/4})$ and complexity $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ for achieving an $\varepsilon$-near stationary point in terms of the norm of the gradient of Moreau envelope and gradient mapping. While classical convergence guarantees require i.i.d. data sampling from the target distribution, we only require a mild mixing condition of the conditional distribution, which holds for a wide class of Markov chain sampling algorithms. This improves the existing complexity for constrained smooth nonconvex optimization with dependent data from $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ with a significantly simpler analysis. We illustrate the generality of our approach by deriving convergence results with dependent data for stochastic proximal gradient methods, adaptive stochastic gradient algorithm AdaGrad and stochastic gradient algorithm with heavy ball momentum. As an application, we obtain first online nonnegative matrix factorization algorithms for dependent data based on stochastic projected gradient methods with adaptive step sizes and optimal rate of convergence.},

Motivated by problems in malware detection, where sequence lengths of $T \geq 100,000$ are a roadblock to deep learning, we re-cast self-attention using the neuro-symbolic approach of Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR). In doing so we perform the same high-level strategy of the standard self-attention: a set of queries matching against a set of keys, and returning a weighted response of the values for each key. Implemented as a ``Hrrformer'' we obtain several benefits including $O(TH \log H)$ time complexity, $O(TH)$ space complexity, and convergence in 10$\times$ fewer epochs.},

However, these zero-shot classifiers need prompt engineering to achieve high accuracy. Prompt engineering typically requires hand-crafting a set of prompts for individual downstream tasks. In this work, we aim to automate this prompt engineering and improve zero-shot accuracy through prompt ensembling. In particular, we ask ``Given a large pool of prompts, can we automatically score the prompts and ensemble those that are most suitable for a particular downstream dataset, without needing access to labeled validation data?''. We demonstrate that this is possible. In doing so, we identify several pathologies in a naive prompt scoring method where the score can be easily overconfident due to biases in pre-training and test data, and we propose a novel prompt scoring method that corrects for the biases. Using our proposed scoring method to create a weighted average prompt ensemble, our method outperforms equal average ensemble, as well as hand-crafted prompts, on ImageNet, 4 of its variants, and 11 fine-grained classification benchmarks, all while being fully automatic, optimization-free, and not requiring access to labeled validation data.},

Our analysis exhibits a fundamental trade-off between privacy, robustness, and utility. To prove our lower bound, we consider the case of mean estimation, subject to distributed DP and robustness constraints, and devise reductions to centralized estimation of one-way marginals. We prove our matching upper bound by presenting a new distributed ML algorithm using a high-dimensional robust aggregation rule.},

Since we cannot restrict ourselves to absolutely continuous measures, we have to deal with transport plans and velocity plans instead of usual transport maps and velocity fields. Indeed, we approximate the disintegration of both plans by generative NNs which are learned with respect to appropriate loss functions. In order to evaluate the quality of both neural schemes, we benchmark them on the interaction energy.},

We study the approximation factor in a broad spectrum of settings, such as with the weighted $L_2$-norm (where the weighting is the offline state distribution), the $L_\infty$ norm, the presence vs. absence of state aliasing, and full vs. partial coverage of the state space. We establish the optimal asymptotic approximation factors (up to constants) for all of these settings. In particular, our bounds identify two instance-dependent factors for the $L_2(\mu)$ norm and only one for the $L_\infty$ norm, which are shown to dictate the hardness of off-policy evaluation under misspecification.},

We comprehensively explore this question in a detailed study of various definitions of adaptive sharpness in settings ranging from training from scratch on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 to fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet and BERT on MNLI. We focus mostly on transformers for which little is known in terms of sharpness despite their widespread usage. Overall, we observe that sharpness does not correlate well with generalization but rather with some training parameters like the learning rate that can be positively or negatively correlated with generalization depending on the setup. Interestingly, in multiple cases, we observe a consistent negative correlation of sharpness with out-of-distribution error implying that sharper minima can generalize better. Finally, we illustrate on a simple model that the right sharpness measure is highly data-dependent, and that we do not understand well this aspect for realistic data distributions.},

We present empirical observations that commonly used large step sizes (i) may lead the iterates to jump from one side of a valley to the other causing loss stabilization, and (ii) this stabilization induces a hidden stochastic dynamics that biases it implicitly toward simple predictors. Furthermore, we show empirically that the longer large step sizes keep SGD high in the loss landscape valleys, the better the implicit regularization can operate and find sparse representations. Notably, no explicit regularization is used: the regularization effect comes solely from the SGD dynamics influenced by the large step sizes schedule. Therefore, these observations unveil how, through the step size schedules, both gradient and noise drive together the SGD dynamics through the loss landscape of neural networks.},

One key issue is that the data generated by both natural and artificial processes often comprise time series that are irregularly sampled and/or contain missing observations. In this work, we propose the Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Model (NCDSSM) for continuous-time modeling of time series through discrete-time observations. NCDSSM employs auxiliary variables to disentangle recognition from dynamics, thus requiring amortized inference only for the auxiliary variables. Leveraging techniques from continuous-discrete filtering theory, we demonstrate how to perform accurate Bayesian inference for the dynamic states. We propose three flexible parameterizations of the latent dynamics and an efficient training objective that marginalizes the dynamic states during inference. Empirical results on multiple benchmark datasets across various domains show improved imputation and forecasting performance of NCDSSM over existing models.},

We show that this departure may lead to arbitrary deterioration of model performance. Based on our analysis, we introduce a novel training method for learning-based acceleration of iterative methods. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that the proposed method improves upon the existing methods, and demonstrate its significant advantage and versatility through various numerical applications.},

In many environments, the dynamics can be summarized by a small set of events that capture the semantic behavior of the system. Typically, these events form chains or cascades. We often wish to change the system behavior using a single intervention that propagates through the cascade. For instance, one may trigger a biochemical cascade to switch the state of a cell or, in logistics, reroute a truck to meet an unexpected, urgent delivery. We introduce a new supervised learning setup called Cascade. An agent observes a system with known dynamics evolving from some initial state. The agent is given a structured semantic instruction and needs to make an intervention that triggers a cascade of events, such that the system reaches an alternative (counterfactual) behavior. We combine semantic tree search with an event-driven forward model and devise an algorithm that learns to efficiently search in exponentially large semantic trees. We demonstrate that our approach learns to follow instructions to intervene in new complex scenes. When provided with an observed cascade of events, it can also reason about alternative outcomes.},

Diffusion generative models have achieved considerable success in many applications. Score-based generative stochastic differential equations (SDE) model is a continuous-time diffusion model framework that enjoys many benefits, but the originally proposed SDEs are not naturally designed for modeling discrete data. To develop generative SDE models for discrete data such as biological sequences, here we introduce a diffusion process defined in the probability simplex space with stationary distribution being the Dirichlet distribution. This makes diffusion in continuous space natural for modeling discrete data. We refer to this approach as Dirichlet diffusion score model. We demonstrate that this technique can generate samples that satisfy hard constraints using a Sudoku generation task. This generative model can also solve Sudoku, including hard puzzles, without additional training. Finally, we applied this approach to develop the first human promoter DNA sequence design model and showed that designed sequences share similar properties with natural promoter sequences.},

This is in contrast to the common intuition that the absence of strong convexity precludes linear convergence of first-order methods, and highlights the importance of variable learning rates for gradient descent.

However, in practice, naive imputation exhibits good predictive performance. In this paper, we study the impact of imputation in a high-dimensional linear model with MCAR missing data. We prove that zero imputation performs an implicit regularization closely related to the ridge method, often used in high-dimensional problems.

  abstract     = {Message passing neural networks have shown a lot of success on graph-structured data. However, there are many instances where message passing can lead to over-smoothing or fail when neighboring nodes belong to different classes. In this work, we introduce a simple yet general framework for improving learning in message passing neural networks. Our approach essentially upsamples edges in the original graph by adding "slow nodes" at each edge that can mediate communication between a source and a target node. Our method only modifies the input graph, making it plug-and-play and easy to use with existing models. To understand the benefits of slowing down message passing, we provide theoretical and empirical analyses. We report results on several supervised and self-supervised benchmarks, and show improvements across the board, notably in heterophilic conditions where adjacent nodes are more likely to have different labels.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are often known for sample inefficiency and difficult generalization. Recently, Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) emerged as a new paradigm for zero-shot generalization by simultaneously learning a task distribution and agent policies on the generated tasks. This is a non-stationary process where the task distribution evolves along with agent policies; creating an instability over time. While past works demonstrated the potential of such approaches, sampling effectively from the task space remains an open challenge, bottlenecking these approaches. To this end, we introduce CLUTR: a novel unsupervised curriculum learning algorithm that decouples task representation and curriculum learning into a two-stage optimization. It first trains a recurrent variational autoencoder on randomly generated tasks to learn a latent task manifold. Next, a teacher agent creates a curriculum by maximizing a minimax REGRET-based objective on a set of latent tasks sampled from this manifold. Using the fixed-pretrained task manifold, we show that CLUTR successfully overcomes the non-stationarity problem and improves stability. Our experimental results show CLUTR outperforms PAIRED, a principled and popular UED method, in the challenging CarRacing and navigation environments: achieving 10.6X and 45% improvement in zero-shot generalization, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The paper addresses scenarios where subgraphs of a larger global graph may be distributed across multiple devices, and only locally accessible due to privacy restrictions, although there may be links between subgraphs. Recently proposed subgraph Federated Learning (FL) methods deal with those missing links across local subgraphs while distributively training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on them. However, they have overlooked the inevitable heterogeneity between subgraphs comprising different communities of a global graph, consequently collapsing the incompatible knowledge from local GNN models. To this end, we introduce a new subgraph FL problem, personalized subgraph FL, which focuses on the joint improvement of the interrelated local GNNs rather than learning a single global model, and propose a novel framework, FEDerated Personalized sUBgraph learning (FED-PUB), to tackle it. FED-PUB utilizes functional embeddings of the local GNNs using random graphs as inputs to compute similarities between them, and use the similarities to perform weighted averaging for server-side aggregation. Further, it learns a personalized sparse mask at each client to select and update only the subgraph-relevant subset of the aggregated parameters.},

Inference is often difficult due to the latent structure of the model. To deal with parameter estimation in the presence of latent variables, well-known efficient methods exist, such as gradient-based and EM-type algorithms, but with practical and theoretical limitations. In this paper, we propose as an alternative for parameter estimation an efficient preconditioned stochastic gradient algorithm. Our method includes a preconditioning step based on a positive definite Fisher information matrix estimate. We prove convergence results for the proposed algorithm under mild assumptions for very general latent variables models. We illustrate through relevant simulations the performance of the proposed methodology in a nonlinear mixed effects model and in a stochastic block model.},

We propose Generative Causal Representation Learning (GCRL) which leverages causality to facilitate knowledge transfer under distribution shifts. While we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method in human trajectory prediction models, GCRL can be applied to other domains as well. First, we propose a novel causal model that explains the generative factors in motion forecasting datasets using features that are common across all environments and with features that are specific to each environment. Selection variables are used to determine which parts of the model can be directly transferred to a new environment without fine-tuning. Second, we propose an end-to-end variational learning paradigm to learn the causal mechanisms that generate observations from features. GCRL is supported by strong theoretical results that imply identifiability of the causal model under certain assumptions. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world motion forecasting datasets show the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed method for knowledge transfer under zero-shot and low-shot settings by substantially outperforming the prior motion forecasting models on out-of-distribution prediction.},

While both problems have received significant research attention lately, they have been pursued independently. This may not be surprising, since the two tasks have seemingly conflicting goals. This paper provides a new unified approach that is capable of simultaneously generalizing to covariate shifts while robustly detecting semantic shifts. We propose a margin-based learning framework that exploits freely available unlabeled data in the wild that captures the environmental test-time OOD distributions under both covariate and semantic shifts. We show both empirically and theoretically that the proposed margin constraint is the key to achieving both OOD generalization and detection. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our framework, outperforming competitive baselines that specialize in either OOD generalization or OOD detection.},

Embedding-based methods require training on complex queries and may not generalize well to out-of-distribution query structures. Recent work frames this task as an end-to-end optimization problem, and it only requires a pretrained link predictor. However, due to the exponentially large combinatorial search space, the optimal solution can only be approximated, limiting the final accuracy. In this work, we propose QTO (Query Computation Tree Optimization) that can efficiently find the exact optimal solution. QTO finds the optimal solution by a forward-backward propagation on the tree-like computation graph, i.e., query computation tree. In particular, QTO utilizes the independence encoded in the query computation tree to reduce the search space, where only local computations are needed.},

However, IGNNs suffer from several issues, including 1) their expressivity is limited by their parameterizations for the well-posedness guarantee, 2) IGNNs are unstable in learning LRD, and 3) IGNNs become computationally inefficient when learning LRD. In this paper, we provide a new well-posedness characterization for IGNNs leveraging monotone operator theory, resulting in a much more expressive parameterization than the existing one. We also propose an orthogonal parameterization for IGNN based on Cayley transform to stabilize learning LRD. Furthermore, we leverage Anderson-accelerated operator splitting schemes to efficiently solve for the fixed point of the equilibrium equation of IGNN with monotone or orthogonal parameterization. We verify the computational efficiency and accuracy of the new models over existing IGNNs on various graph learning tasks at both graph and node levels.},

In this work we give a new approach to learning mixtures of linear dynamical systems that is based on tensor decompositions. As a result, our algorithm succeeds without strong separation conditions on the components, and can be used to compete with the Bayes optimal clustering of the trajectories. Moreover our algorithm works in the challenging partially-observed setting.

Our estimate of the required number of rows is similar to that of the standard SRHT. This suggests that the two transforms should provide the same accuracy of approximation in the algorithms. The block SRHT can be readily incorporated into randomized methods for computing a low-rank approximation of a large-scale matrix, such as the Nystr{\"o}m method.

Instead, we ask: can we simply apply existing off-policy methods to leverage offline data when learning online? In this work, we demonstrate that the answer is yes; however, a set of minimal but important changes to existing off-policy RL algorithms are required to achieve reliable performance. We extensively ablate these design choices, demonstrating the key factors that most affect performance, and arrive at a set of recommendations that practitioners can readily apply, whether their data comprise a small number of expert demonstrations or large volumes of sub-optimal trajectories.},

We find that robust and non-robust networks indeed have different representations. However, these representations are compatible regarding accuracy. From the point of view of robust accuracy, compatibility decreases quickly after the first few layers but the representations become compatible again in the last layers, in the sense that the properties of the front model can be recovered. Moreover, this is true even in the case of cross-task stitching. Our results suggest that stitching in the initial, preprocessing layers and the final, abstract layers test different kinds of compatibilities. In particular, the final layers are easy to match, because their representations depend mostly on the same abstract task specification, in our case, the classification of the input into n classes.},

Given the inherent non-stationarity in an advertiser's value and also competing advertisers' values over time, a commonly used approach is to learn a target expenditure plan that specifies a target spend as a function of time, and then run a controller that tracks this plan. This raises the question: how many historical samples are required to learn a good expenditure plan? We study this question by considering an advertiser repeatedly participating in $T$ second-price auctions, where the tuple of her value and the highest competing bid is drawn from an unknown time-varying distribution. The advertiser seeks to maximize her total utility subject to her budget constraint. Prior work has shown the sufficiency of $T\log T$ samples per distribution to achieve the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$-regret. We dramatically improve this state-of-the-art and show that just one sample per distribution is enough to achieve the near-optimal $\tilde O(\sqrt{T})$-regret, while still being robust to noise in the sampling distributions.},

However, user controllability of the generated image, and fast adaptation to new tasks still remains an open challenge, currently mostly addressed by costly and long re-training and fine-tuning or ad-hoc adaptations to specific image generation tasks. In this work, we present {MultiDiffusion}, a unified framework that enables versatile and controllable image generation, using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, without any further training or finetuning. At the center of our approach is a new generation process, based on an optimization task that binds together multiple diffusion generation processes with a shared set of parameters or constraints. We show that {MultiDiffusion} can be readily applied to generate high quality and diverse images that adhere to user-provided controls, such as desired aspect ratio (e.g., panorama), and spatial guiding signals, ranging from tight segmentation masks to bounding boxes.},

The KSD is defined by its Stein operator: current operators used in testing apply to fixed-dimensional spaces. As our main contribution, we extend the KSD to the variable-dimension setting by identifying appropriate Stein operators, and propose a novel KSD goodness-of-fit test. As with the previous variants, the proposed KSD does not require the density to be normalized, allowing the evaluation of a large class of models. Our test is shown to perform well in practice on discrete sequential data benchmarks.},

We first present a novel auditing scheme, capable of utilizing feedback from dynamically-selected panels of multiple, possibly inconsistent, auditors regarding fairness violations. In particular, we show how our proposed auditing scheme allows for algorithmically exploring the resulting accuracy-fairness frontier, with no need for additional feedback from auditors. We then present an efficient reduction from our problem of online learning with one-sided feedback and a panel reporting fairness violations to the contextual combinatorial semi-bandit problem with side observations.},

An emerging strand of work empirically estimates the protection afforded by differentially private training as a confidence interval for the privacy budget $\hat{\varepsilon}$ spent with respect to specific threat models. Existing approaches derive confidence intervals for $\hat{\varepsilon}$ from confidence intervals for false positive and false negative rates of membership inference attacks, which requires training an impractically large number of models to get intervals that are actionable.

Once trained, the mixture components can be extracted and the neural ODE can be discarded, leaving us with an effective, but low-resource model. We additionally explore the use of a training curriculum from an easy-to-model latent space extracted from a normalizing flow to the more complex input space and show that the smooth curriculum helps to stabilize and improve results with and without the continuous parameterization.},

However, the combinatorial space of possible expressions can make it challenging for traditional evolutionary algorithms to find the correct expression in a reasonable amount of time. To address this issue, Neural Symbolic Regression (NSR) algorithms have been developed that can quickly identify patterns in the data and generate analytical expressions. However, these methods, in their current form, lack the capability to incorporate user-defined prior knowledge, which is often required in natural sciences and engineering fields. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel neural symbolic regression method, named Neural Symbolic Regression with Hypothesis (NSRwH) that enables the explicit incorporation of user-defined prior knowledge into the symbolic regression process.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that accurate probabilistic predictors can be trained through empirical risk minimisation with proper scoring rules as loss functions. While such learners capture so-called aleatoric uncertainty of predictions, various machine learning methods have recently been developed with the goal to let the learner also represent its epistemic uncertainty, i.e., the uncertainty caused by a lack of knowledge and data. An emerging branch of the literature proposes the use of a second-order learner that provides predictions in terms of distributions on probability distributions. However, recent work has revealed serious theoretical shortcomings for second-order predictors based on loss minimisation. In this paper, we generalise these findings and prove a more fundamental result: There seems to be no loss function that provides an incentive for a second-order learner to faithfully represent its epistemic uncertainty in the same manner as proper scoring rules do for standard (first-order) learners.},

  abstract     = {Recent work have demonstrated that robustness (to "corruption") can be at odds with generalization. Adversarial training, for instance, aims to reduce the problematic susceptibility of modern neural networks to small data perturbations. Surprisingly, overfitting is a major concern in adversarial training despite being mostly absent in standard training. We provide here theoretical evidence for this peculiar "robust overfitting" phenomenon. Subsequently, we advance a novel distributionally robust loss function bridging robustness and generalization. We demonstrate both theoretically as well as empirically the loss to enjoy a certified level of robustness against two common types of corruption—data evasion and poisoning attacks—while ensuring guaranteed generalization. We show through careful numerical experiments that our resulting holistic robust (HR) training procedure yields SOTA performance. Finally, we indicate that HR training can be interpreted as a direct extension of adversarial training and comes with a negligible additional computational burden.},

  abstract     = {Oceanographers are interested in predicting ocean currents and identifying divergences in a current vector field based on sparse observations of buoy velocities. Since we expect current dynamics to be smooth but highly non-linear, Gaussian processes (GPs) offer an attractive model. But we show that applying a GP with a standard stationary kernel directly to buoy data can struggle at both current prediction and divergence identification – due to some physically unrealistic prior assumptions. To better reflect known physical properties of currents, we propose to instead put a standard stationary kernel on the divergence and curl-free components of a vector field obtained through a Helmholtz decomposition. We show that, because this decomposition relates to the original vector field just via mixed partial derivatives, we can still perform inference given the original data with only a small constant multiple of additional computational expense. We illustrate the benefits of our method on synthetic and real oceans data.},

The paper presents three main contributions: (1) We show how to obtain a tight $\tilde O(T^{1/2})$ regret bound in the case where the sender faces a single receiver and has bandit feedback, improving over the best previously known bound of $\tilde O(T^{4/5})$. (2) We provide the first no-regret guarantees for the multi-receiver setting under bandit feedback. (3) We show how to design no-regret algorithms with polynomial per-iteration running time by exploiting type reporting, thereby circumventing known complexity results on online Bayesian persuasion. We provide efficient algorithms guaranteeing a $O(T^{1/2})$ regret upper bound both in the single- and multi-receiver scenario when type reporting is allowed.},

  abstract     = {The computational study of equilibria involving constraints on players' strategies has been largely neglected. However, in real-world applications, players are usually subject to constraints ruling out the feasibility of some of their strategies, such as, e.g., safety requirements and budget caps. Computational studies on constrained versions of the Nash equilibrium have lead to some results under very stringent assumptions, while finding constrained versions of the correlated equilibrium (CE) is still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce and computationally characterize constrained Phi-equilibria—a more general notion than constrained CEs—in normal-form games. We show that computing such equilibria is in general computationally intractable, and also that the set of the equilibria may not be convex, providing a sharp divide with unconstrained CEs. Nevertheless, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a constrained (approximate) Phi-equilibrium maximizing a given linear function, when either the number of constraints or that of players' actions is fixed. Moreover, in the special case in which a player's constraints do not depend on other players' strategies, we show that an exact, function-maximizing equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time, while one (approximate) equilibrium can be found with an efficient decentralized no-regret learning algorithm.},

That is, until recent advances made it possible to search this space using a differentiable metric, drastically reducing search time. While this technique—named NOTEARS—is widely considered a seminal work in DAG-discovery, it concedes an important property in favour of differentiability: transportability. To be transportable, the structures discovered on one dataset must apply to another dataset from the same domain. We introduce D-Struct which recovers transportability in the discovered structures through a novel architecture and loss function while remaining fully differentiable.},

This complex has been previously studied to characterize theoretical properties of neural networks, but, in practice, extracting it remains a challenge due to its high combinatorial complexity. A natural idea described in previous works is to subdivide the regions via intersections with hyperplanes induced by each neuron. However, we argue that this view leads to computational redundancy. Instead of regions, we propose to subdivide edges, leading to a novel method for polyhedral complex extraction. A key to this are sign-vectors, which encode the combinatorial structure of the complex. Our approach allows to use standard tensor operations on a GPU, taking seconds for millions of cells on a consumer grade machine. Motivated by the growing interest in neural shape representation, we use the speed and differentiability of our method to optimize geometric properties of the complex.},

As a result, OCSDF comes with a new metric, certified AUROC, that can be computed at the same cost as any classical AUROC. The authors show that OCSDF is competitive against concurrent methods on tabular and image data while being way more robust to adversarial attacks, illustrating its theoretical properties. Finally, as exploratory research perspectives, they theoretically and empirically show how OCSDF connects OCC with image generation and implicit neural surface parametrization.},

However, the performance of existing neural reasoners significantly degrades on out-of-distribution (OOD) test data, where inputs have larger sizes. In this work, we make an important observation: there are many different inputs for which an algorithm will perform certain intermediate computations identically. This insight allows us to develop data augmentation procedures that, given an algorithm's intermediate trajectory, produce inputs for which the target algorithm would have exactly the same next trajectory step. The authors ensure invariance in the next-step prediction across such inputs by employing a self-supervised objective derived by their observation, formalized in a causal graph. They prove that the resulting method, which they call Hint-ReLIC, improves the OOD generalization capabilities of the reasoner. They evaluate their method on the CLRS algorithmic reasoning benchmark, where they show up to 3× improvements on the OOD test data.},

The MMD is commonly estimated at a root-m rate, where m is the number of simulated samples. This can lead to significant computational challenges since a large m is required to obtain an accurate estimate, which is crucial for parameter estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel estimator for the MMD with significantly improved sample complexity. The estimator is particularly well suited for computationally expensive smooth simulators with low- to mid-dimensional inputs.},

Unlike in the full-information OLO setting, with bandit feedback, we first show that one cannot improve the standard regret bounds of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ by using hints, even if they are always well-correlated with the cost vector. In contrast, if the algorithm is empowered to issue queries and if all the responses are correct, then we show $O(\log T)$ regret is achievable. We then show how to make this result more robust—when some of the query responses can be adversarial—by using a little feedback on the quality of the responses.},

We study this setting of subset selection problems when, in addition, rankings may contain systemic or unconscious biases toward a group of items. For a general model of input rankings and biases, we show that requiring the selected subset to satisfy group fairness constraints can improve the quality of the selection with respect to unbiased rankings. Importantly, we show that for fairness constraints to be effective, different multiwinner score functions may require a drastically different number of rankings: While for some functions, fairness constraints need an exponential number of rankings to recover a close-to-optimal solution, for others, this dependency is only polynomial.},

We approach this question by showing that counterexample-guided repair can be viewed as a robust optimisation algorithm. While termination guarantees for neural network repair itself remain beyond our reach, we prove termination for more restrained machine learning models and disprove termination in a general setting. We empirically study the practical implications of our theoretical results, demonstrating the suitability of common verifiers and falsifiers for repair despite a disadvantageous theoretical result. Additionally, we use our theoretical insights to devise a novel algorithm for repairing linear regression models based on quadratic programming, surpassing existing approaches.},

However, this universal law provides only a necessary condition for robustness, and it is unable to discriminate between models. In this paper, we address these gaps by focusing on empirical risk minimization in two prototypical settings, namely, random features and the neural tangent kernel (NTK). For random features, the model is not robust for any degree of over-parameterization, even when the necessary condition coming from the universal law of robustness is satisfied. In contrast, for even activations, the NTK model meets the universal lower bound, and it is robust as soon as the necessary condition on over-parameterization is fulfilled. Our analysis decouples the effect of the kernel of the model from an interaction matrix, which describes the interaction with the test data and captures the effect of the activation. Our theoretical results are corroborated by numerical evidence on both synthetic and standard datasets.},

More specifically, we define a Sliced-Wasserstein distance between measures of symmetric positive definite matrices that comes with strong theoretical guarantees. Then, we take advantage of its properties and kernel methods to apply this distance to brain-age prediction from MEG data and compare it to state-of-the-art algorithms based on Riemannian geometry. Finally, we show that it is an efficient surrogate to the Wasserstein distance in domain adaptation for Brain Computer Interface applications.},

To this end, FNOs rely on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), however, DFTs cause visual and spectral artifacts as well as pronounced dissipation when learning operators in spherical coordinates since they incorrectly assume a flat geometry. To overcome this limitation, we generalize FNOs on the sphere, introducing Spherical FNOs (SFNOs) for learning operators on spherical geometries.},

This test is based on the performance of the current policy with respect to the best policy over the current confidence set. This is in contrast with all existing RL algorithms whose episode lengths are only based on the number of visits to the states. This modification does not harm the regret and brings an additional property.

We find existing methods perform differently relative to each other than observed in vision benchmarks, and sometimes perform worse than no adaptation at all. We propose a new simple method which outperforms the existing methods on our new shifts while exhibiting strong performance on a range of vision datasets.

  abstract     = {An important milestone for AI is the development of algorithms that can produce drawings that are indistinguishable from those of humans. Here, we adapt the 'diversity vs. recognizability' scoring framework from Boutin et al (2022) and find that one-shot diffusion models have indeed started to close the gap between humans and machines. However, using a finer-grained measure of the originality of individual samples, we show that strengthening the guidance of diffusion models helps improve the humanness of their drawings, but they still fall short of approximating the originality and recognizability of human drawings. Comparing human category diagnostic features, collected through an online psychophysics experiment, against those derived from diffusion models reveals that humans rely on fewer and more localized features. Overall, our study suggests that diffusion models have significantly helped improve the quality of machine-generated drawings; however, a gap between humans and machines remains -- in part explainable by discrepancies in visual strategies.},

However, outputs of these models rarely align with user's rationales for specific answers. In order to improve this alignment and reinforce commonsense reasons, we propose a tuning paradigm based on human interactions with machine-generated data. Our ILLUME executes the following loop: Given an image-question-answer prompt, the VLM samples multiple candidate rationales, and a human critic provides feedback via preference selection, used for fine-tuning. This loop increases the training data and gradually carves out the VLM's rationalization capabilities that are aligned with human intent. Our exhaustive experiments demonstrate that ILLUME is competitive with standard supervised finetuning while using significantly fewer training data and only requiring minimal feedback.},

While recent efforts to this end have shown promising empirical progress, a theoretical account of when unsupervised object-centric representation learning is possible is still lacking. Consequently, understanding the reasons for the success of existing object-centric methods as well as designing new theoretically grounded methods remains challenging. In the present work, we analyze when object-centric representations can provably be learned without supervision. To this end, we first introduce two assumptions on the generative process for scenes comprised of several objects, which we call compositionality and irreducibility. Under this generative process, we prove that the ground-truth object representations can be identified by an invertible and compositional inference model, even in the presence of dependencies between objects. We empirically validate our results through experiments on synthetic data. Finally, we provide evidence that our theory holds predictive power for existing object-centric models by showing a close correspondence between models' compositionality and invertibility and their empirical identifiability.},

In contrast, our model considers another type of loss and connects with the generative setting. We characterize the critical points and minimizers of the Bures-Wasserstein distance over the space of rank-bounded matrices. The Hessian of this loss at low-rank matrices can theoretically blow up, which creates challenges to analyze convergence of gradient optimization methods. We establish convergence results for gradient flow using a smooth perturbative version of the loss as well as convergence results for finite step size gradient descent under certain assumptions on the initial weights.},

Unfortunately, synthetic data is usually not perfect, resulting in potential errors in downstream tasks. In this work we explore how the generative process affects the downstream ML task. We show that the naive synthetic data approach -- using synthetic data as if it is real -- leads to downstream models and analyses that do not generalize well to real data. As a first step towards better ML in the synthetic data regime, we introduce Deep Generative Ensemble (DGE) -- a framework inspired by Deep Ensembles that aims to implicitly approximate the posterior distribution over the generative process model parameters. DGE improves downstream model training, evaluation, and uncertainty quantification, vastly outperforming the naive approach on average. The largest improvements are achieved for minority classes and low-density regions of the original data, for which the generative uncertainty is largest.},

(iii) How can these benefits be utilized by deep learning models? Our answers to all of these questions center around training networks to handle random noise.

In this work, we develop a novel Book-Keeping (BK) technique that implements existing DP optimizers (thus achieving the same accuracy), with a substantial improvement on the computational cost. Specifically, BK enables DP training on large models and high dimensional data to be roughly as fast and memory-saving as the standard training, whereas previous DP algorithms can be inefficient or incapable of training due to memory error.},

  abstract     = {Graph Transformer (GT) recently has emerged as a new paradigm of graph learning algorithms, outperforming the previously popular Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) on multiple benchmarks. Previous work shows that with proper position embedding, GT can approximate MPNN arbitrarily well, implying that GT is at least as powerful as MPNN. In this paper, we study the inverse connection and show that MPNN with virtual node (VN), a commonly used heuristic with little theoretical understanding, is powerful enough to arbitrarily approximate the self-attention layer of GT. In particular, we first show that if we consider one type of linear transformer, the so-called Performer/Linear Transformer, then MPNN + VN with only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ depth and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ width can approximate a self-attention layer in Performer/Linear Transformer. Next, via a connection between MPNN + VN and DeepSets, we prove the MPNN + VN with $\mathcal{O}(n^d)$ width and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ depth can approximate the self-attention layer arbitrarily well, where $d$ is the input feature dimension. Lastly, under some assumptions, we provide an explicit construction of MPNN + VN with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ width and $\mathcal{O}(n)$ depth approximating the self-attention layer in GT arbitrarily well. On the empirical side, we demonstrate that 1) MPNN + VN is a surprisingly strong baseline, outperforming GT on the recently proposed Long Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB) dataset, 2) our MPNN + VN improves over early implementation on a wide range of OGB datasets and 3) MPNN + VN outperforms Linear Transformer and MPNN on the climate modeling task.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents Ske2Grid, a new representation learning framework for improved skeleton-based action recognition. In Ske2Grid, we define a regular convolution operation upon a novel grid representation of human skeleton, which is a compact image-like grid patch constructed and learned through three novel designs. Specifically, we propose a graph-node index transform (GIT) to construct a regular grid patch through assigning the nodes in the skeleton graph one by one to the desired grid cells. To ensure that GIT is a bijection and enrich the expressiveness of the grid representation, an up-sampling transform (UPT) is learned to interpolate the skeleton graph nodes for filling the grid patch to the full. To resolve the problem when the one-step UPT is aggressive and further exploit the representation capability of the grid patch with increasing spatial size, a progressive learning strategy (PLS) is proposed which decouples the UPT into multiple steps and aligns them to multiple paired GITs through a compact cascaded design learned progressively. We construct networks upon prevailing graph convolution networks and conduct experiments on six mainstream skeleton-based action recognition datasets. Experiments show that our Ske2Grid significantly outperforms existing GCN-based solutions under different benchmark settings, without bells and whistles.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel tree-based algorithm named Extrapolated Random Tree for Regression (ERTR) that adapts to arbitrary smoothness of the regression function while maintaining the interpretability of the tree. We first put forward the homothetic random tree for regression (HRTR) that converges to the target function as the homothetic ratio approaches zero. Then ERTR uses a linear regression model to extrapolate HRTR estimations with different ratios to the ratio zero. From the theoretical perspective, we for the first time establish the optimal convergence rates for ERTR when the target function resides in the general Hölder space $C^{k,\alpha}$ for $k\in \mathbb{N}$, whereas the lower bound of the convergence rate of the random tree for regression (RTR) is strictly slower than ERTR in the space $C^{k,\alpha}$ for $k\geq 1$. This shows that ERTR outperforms RTR for the target function with high-order smoothness due to the extrapolation. In the experiments, we compare ERTR with state-of-the-art tree algorithms on real datasets to show the superior performance of our model. Moreover, promising improvements are brought by using the extrapolated trees as base learners in the extension of ERTR to ensemble methods.},

  abstract     = {Nonconvex optimization is central in solving many machine learning problems, in which block-wise structure is commonly encountered. In this work, the authors propose cyclic block coordinate methods for nonconvex optimization problems with non-asymptotic gradient norm guarantees. Their convergence analysis is based on a gradient Lipschitz condition with respect to a Mahalanobis norm, inspired by recent progress on cyclic block coordinate methods. In deterministic settings, their convergence guarantee matches gradient descent, but with the gradient Lipschitz constant defined with respect to a Mahalanobis norm. In stochastic settings, they use recursive variance reduction to decrease per-iteration cost and match the arithmetic operation complexity of current optimal stochastic full-gradient methods, with a unified analysis for both finite-sum and infinite-sum cases. They prove a faster linear convergence result when a Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PŁ) condition holds. To their knowledge, this is the first work to provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for a cyclic block coordinate method in general composite (smooth + nonsmooth) nonconvex settings. Their experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed cyclic scheme in training deep neural nets.},

This paper empirically suggests a surprisingly simple answer: linearly - by straightforward model weight arithmetic! We start by drawing several key observations: (i) assuming that we train the same model architecture on both a clean dataset and its corrupted version, a comparison between the two resultant models shows their weights to mostly differ in shallow layers; (ii) the weight difference after projection, which we call "Robust Weight Signature" (RWS), appears to be discriminative and indicative of different corruption types; (iii) perhaps most strikingly, for the same corruption type, the RWSs obtained by one model architecture are highly consistent and transferable across different datasets. Based on those RWS observations, we propose a minimalistic model robustness "patching" framework that carries a model trained on clean data together with its pre-extracted RWSs. In this way, injecting certain robustness to the model is reduced to directly adding the corresponding RWS to its weight. We experimentally verify our proposed framework to be remarkably (1) lightweight. since RWSs concentrate on the shallowest few layers and we further show they can be painlessly quantized, storing an RWS is up to 13 x more compact than storing the full weight copy; (2) in-situ adjustable. RWSs can be appended as needed and later taken off to restore the intact clean model. We further demonstrate one can linearly re-scale the RWS to control the patched robustness strength; (3) composable. Multiple RWSs can be added simultaneously to patch more comprehensive robustness at once; and (4) transferable. Even when the clean model backbone is continually adapted or updated, RWSs remain as effective patches due to their outstanding cross-dataset transferability.},

In this work, we take one of the initial steps in addressing the multi-agent version of this problem and propose a new algorithm, MA-LfL (Multiagent Learning from a Learner). Unlike the state-of-the-art literature, which recovers the reward functions from trajectories produced by agents in some equilibrium, we study the problem of inferring the reward functions of interacting agents in a general sum stochastic game.},

Therefore, there has been growing interest in the community to introduce multi-scale structures to GNNs for physics simulation. However, current state-of-the-art methods are limited by their reliance on the labor-heavy drawing of coarser meshes or building coarser levels based on spatial proximity, which can introduce wrong edges across geometry boundaries. Inspired by the bipartite graph determination, we propose a novel pooling strategy, bi-stride to tackle the aforementioned limitations. Bi-stride pools nodes on every other frontier of the Breadth-First-Search (BFS), without the need for the manual drawing of coarser meshes and, avoid wrong edges introduced by spatial proximity. Additionally, it enables a reduced number of MP times on each level and the non-parametrized pooling and unpooling by interpolations, similar to convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which significantly reduces computational requirements.},

While knowledge distillation is a proven strategy to enhance the performance of lightweight classification models, its application to structured outputs like object detection and instance segmentation remains a complicated task, due to the variability in outputs and complex internal network modules involved in the distillation process. In this paper, we propose a simple yet surprisingly effective sequential approach to knowledge distillation that progressively transfers the knowledge of a set of teacher detectors to a given lightweight student. To distill knowledge from a highly accurate but complex teacher model, we construct a sequence of teachers to help the student gradually adapt. Our progressive strategy can be easily combined with existing detection distillation mechanisms to consistently maximize student performance in various settings. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully distill knowledge from Transformer-based teacher detectors to convolution-based students, and unprecedentedly boost the performance of ResNet-50 based RetinaNet from 36.5% to 42.0% AP and Mask R-CNN from 38.2% to 42.5% AP on the MS COCO benchmark.},

We study one such problem setting, that of "one-sided" matrix completion, where our goal is to recover the right singular vectors of X, even in the regime where recovering the left singular vectors is impossible, which arises when there are more rows than columns and very few observations. We propose a natural algorithm that involves imputing the missing values of the matrix X^TX and show that even with only two observations per row in X, we can provably recover X^TX as long as we have at least Ω(r² d log d) rows, where r is the rank and d is the number of columns.},

The paper investigates several key scientific questions using an interactive textual environment designed to study higher-level forms of functional grounding, and a set of spatial and navigation tasks: 1) Can LLMs boost sample efficiency for online learning of various RL tasks? 2) How can it boost different forms of generalization? 3) What is the impact of online learning?

In this work, we propose Stein Variational Goal Generation (SVGG), which samples goals of intermediate difficulty for the agent, by leveraging a learned predictive model of its goal reaching capabilities. The distribution of goals is modeled with particles that are attracted in areas of appropriate difficulty using Stein Variational Gradient Descent.

Unlike most existing results focusing on final iterate lower bounds in terms of the number of components n and the number of epochs K, we seek bounds for arbitrary weighted average iterates that are tight in all factors including the condition number κ. For SGD with Random Reshuffling, we present lower bounds that have tighter κ dependencies than existing bounds. Our results are the first to perfectly close the gap between lower and upper bounds for weighted average iterates in both strongly-convex and convex cases. We also prove weighted average iterate lower bounds for arbitrary permutation-based SGD, which apply to all variants that carefully choose the best permutation.},

In this work, we posit an alternative exploration incentive in terms of the integral probability metric (IPM) between a current estimate of the transition model and the unknown optimal, which under suitable conditions, can be computed in closed form with the kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD).

Muse is trained on a masked modeling task in discrete token space: given the text embedding extracted from a pre-trained large language model (LLM), Muse learns to predict randomly masked image tokens. Compared to pixel-space diffusion models, such as Imagen and DALL-E 2, Muse is significantly more efficient due to the use of discrete tokens and requires fewer sampling iterations; compared to autoregressive models such as Parti, Muse is more efficient due to the use of parallel decoding. The use of a pre-trained LLM enables fine-grained language understanding, which translates to high-fidelity image generation and the understanding of visual concepts such as objects, their spatial relationships, pose, cardinality etc. Our 900M parameter model achieves a new SOTA on CC3M, with an FID score of 6.06. The Muse 3B parameter model achieves an FID of 7.88 on zero-shot COCO evaluation, along with a CLIP score of 0.32. Muse also directly enables a number of image editing applications without the need to fine-tune or invert the model: inpainting, outpainting, and mask-free editing.},

CSBMs model probability density functions as Boltzmann distributions, and assign their predictions as the negative gradients of some scalar-valued energy functions. On the other hand, USBMs employ flexible architectures capable of directly estimating scores without the need to explicitly model energy functions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the architectural constraints of CSBMs may limit their modeling ability. In addition, we show that USBMs' inability to preserve the property of conservativeness may lead to degraded performance in practice. To address the above issues, we propose Quasi-Conservative Score-Based Models (QCSBMs) for keeping the advantages of both CSBMs and USBMs. Our theoretical derivations demonstrate that the training objective of QCSBMs can be efficiently integrated into the training processes by leveraging the Hutchinson's trace estimator. In addition, our experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and SVHN datasets validate the effectiveness of QCSBMs. Finally, we justify the advantage of QCSBMs using an example of a one-layered autoencoder.},

We present differentially private and robust variants of the arm elimination algorithm using logarithmic batch queries under two privacy models and provide regret bounds in both settings. In the first model, every reward in each round is reported by a potentially different client, which reduces to standard local differential privacy (LDP). In the second model, every action is owned by a different client, who may aggregate the rewards over multiple queries and privatize the aggregate response instead. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithms are the first simultaneously providing differential privacy and adversarial robustness in the stochastic linear bandits problem.},

Extensive work has been done on privately maximizing submodular functions in the general case when the function depends upon the private data of individuals. However, when the size of the data stream drawn from the domain of the objective function is large or arrives very fast, one must privately optimize the objective within the constraints of the streaming setting. We establish fundamental differentially private baselines for this problem and then derive better trade-offs between privacy and utility for the special case of decomposable submodular functions. A submodular function is decomposable when it can be written as a sum of submodular functions; this structure arises naturally when each summand function models the utility of an individual and the goal is to study the total utility of the whole population as in the well-known Combinatorial Public Projects Problem. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis with experimental corroboration.},

This opposes common wisdom in learning theory, where the expected error is supposed to decrease as the dataset grows in size. In this work, we leverage extreme value theory to address this apparent contradiction. Our results show that the tails of the data distribution play an important role in determining the worst-group-accuracy of linear classifiers. When learning on data with heavy tails, throwing away data restores the geometric symmetry of the resulting classifier, and therefore improves its worst-group generalization.},

An existing solution corrects this discrepancy by using γᵗ as a factor in the gradient estimate.

Despite achieving remarkable performance, existing FMU techniques suffer from inefficiency due to two sequential operations of training and retraining/unlearning on large-scale datasets. Our prior study, PCMU, was proposed to improve the efficiency of centralized machine unlearning (CMU) with certified guarantees, by simultaneously executing the training and unlearning operations. This paper proposes a fast FMU algorithm, FFMU, for improving the FMU efficiency while maintaining the unlearning quality. The PCMU method is leveraged to train a local machine learning (MU) model on each edge device. We propose to employ nonlinear functional analysis techniques to refine the local MU models as output functions of a Nemytskii operator. We conduct theoretical analysis to derive that the Nemytskii operator has a global Lipschitz constant, which allows us to bound the difference between two MU models regarding the distance between their gradients. Based on the Nemytskii operator and average smooth local gradients, the global MU model on the server is guaranteed to achieve close performance to each local MU model with the certified guarantees.},

  abstract     = {Executing actions in a correlated manner is a common strategy for human coordination that often leads to better cooperation, which is also potentially beneficial for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, the recent success of MARL relies heavily on the convenient paradigm of purely decentralized execution, where there is no action correlation among agents for scalability considerations. In this work, we introduce a Bayesian network to inaugurate correlations between agents' action selections in their joint policy. Theoretically, we establish a theoretical justification for why action dependencies are beneficial by deriving the multi-agent policy gradient formula under such a Bayesian network joint policy and proving its global convergence to Nash equilibria under tabular softmax policy parameterization in cooperative Markov games. Further, by equipping existing MARL algorithms with a recent method of differentiable directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), we develop practical algorithms to learn the context-aware Bayesian network policies in scenarios with partial observability and various difficulty. We also dynamically decrease the sparsity of the learned DAG throughout the training process, which leads to weakly or even purely independent policies for decentralized execution.

  abstract     = {Offline model-based optimization aims to maximize a black-box objective function with a static dataset of designs and their scores. In this paper, we focus on biological sequence design to maximize some sequence score. A recent approach employs bidirectional learning, combining a forward mapping for exploitation and a backward mapping for constraint, and it relies on the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of an infinitely wide network to build a proxy model. Though effective, the NTK cannot learn features because of its parametrization, and its use prevents the incorporation of powerful pre-trained Language Models (LMs) that can capture the rich biophysical information in millions of biological sequences. We adopt an alternative proxy model, adding a linear head to a pre-trained LM, and propose a linearization scheme. This yields a closed-form loss and also takes into account the biophysical information in the pre-trained LM. In addition, the forward mapping and the backward mapping play different roles and thus deserve different weights during sequence optimization. To achieve this, we train an auxiliary model and leverage its weak supervision signal via a bi-level optimization framework to effectively learn how to balance the two mappings. Further, by extending the framework, we develop the first learning rate adaptation module Adaptive-$\eta$, which is compatible with all gradient-based algorithms for offline model-based optimization. Experimental results on DNA/protein sequence design tasks verify the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

This leads to a better approximation than those obtained from existing methods such as Moreau Envelope. We then design private algorithms based on DP stochastic gradient descent and objective perturbation, and show that both algorithms achieve (near) optimal excess generalization risk O(max{1/√n, √(d ln(1/δ))/(nε)}). Through objective perturbation, we further derive an upper bound O(max{√(d/n), √(d ln(1/δ))/(nε)}) on the parameter estimation error under mild assumptions on data generating processes.

The inherent heterogeneity allows tabular data to store rich information. However, based on a recently published tabular benchmark, we can see deep neural networks still fall behind tree-based models on tabular datasets. In this paper, we propose Trompt--which stands for Tabular Prompt--a novel architecture inspired by prompt learning of language models. The essence of prompt learning is to adjust a large pre-trained model through a set of prompts outside the model without directly modifying the model. Based on this idea, Trompt separates the learning strategy of tabular data into two parts. The first part, analogous to pre-trained models, focus on learning the intrinsic information of a table. The second part, analogous to prompts, focus on learning the variations among samples. Trompt is evaluated with the benchmark mentioned above. The experimental results demonstrate that Trompt outperforms state-of-the-art deep neural networks and is comparable to tree-based models.},

Unfortunately, the techniques used to analyze stochastic samplers are often not applicable to deterministic samplers because deriving concentration inequalities for deterministic settings is much more challenging. In this work, we develop the first polynomial-time convergence bounds for deterministic samplers. We analyze not just linear diffusion processes, but also more general, non-linear forward processes. Our key insight is to introduce a new operational interpretation for deterministic sampling. We show that one step along the probability flow ODE can be expressed as two steps: first, a restoration step that runs gradient ascent on the conditional log-likelihood at some infinitesimally previous time, and second, a degradation step that runs the forward process using noise pointing back towards the current iterate. This perspective allows us to extend Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models to general, non-linear forward processes and prove polynomial convergence for these samplers.},

In this work, we provide the first convergence analysis of the Schrödinger bridge algorithm based on approximated projections. Moreover, we propose to apply SBP to probabilistic time series imputation by generating missing values conditioned on observed data.

However, for dynamic DNNs, efficient batching is particularly challenging as the dataflow graph varies per input instance. As a result, state-of-the-art frameworks use heuristics that result in suboptimal batching decisions. We provide an approach for batching dynamic DNNs based on finite state machines, which enables the automatic discovery of batching policies specialized for each DNN via reinforcement learning. Moreover, memory planning that is aware of the batching policy can save significant data movement overheads, which is automated by a PQ tree-based algorithm we introduce. Experimental results show that our framework speeds up state-of-the-art frameworks by on average 1.15x, 1.39x, and 2.45x for chain-based, tree-based, and lattice-based DNNs across CPU platforms.},

A longstanding question in LFI has been how to design or learn good summary statistics of data, but this might now seem unnecessary due to the advent of recent end-to-end (i.e. neural network-based) LFI methods. In this work, we rethink this question with a new method for learning summary statistics. We show that learning sufficient statistics may be easier than direct posterior inference, as the former problem can be reduced to a set of low-dimensional, easy-to-solve learning problems. This suggests us to explicitly decouple summary statistics learning from posterior inference in LFI. Experiments on diverse inference tasks with different data types validate our hypothesis.},

However, existing benchmarks are highly restrictive in the choice of starting point and target point, constraining the movement of the agents within 2D space. In this work, we propose a novel setup for morphology-agnostic RL, dubbed Subequivariant Graph RL in 3D environments (3D-SGRL). Specifically, we first introduce a new set of more practical yet challenging benchmarks in 3D space that allows the agent to have full Degree-of-Freedoms to explore in arbitrary directions starting from arbitrary configurations. Moreover, to optimize the policy over the enlarged state-action space, we propose to inject geometric symmetry, i.e., subequivariance, into the modeling of the policy and Q-function such that the policy can generalize to all directions, improving exploration efficiency. This goal is achieved by a novel SubEquivariant Transformer (SET) that permits expressive message exchange. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on the proposed benchmarks, where our method consistently and significantly outperforms existing approaches on single-task, multi-task, and zero-shot generalization scenarios. Extensive ablations are also conducted to verify our design.},

Previous research has primarily focused on identifying the most powerful models within the model zoo, neglecting to fully leverage the diverse inductive biases contained within. This paper argues that the knowledge contained in weaker models is valuable and presents a method for leveraging the diversity within the model zoo to improve out-of-distribution generalization capabilities. Specifically, we investigate the behaviors of various pretrained models across different domains of downstream tasks by characterizing the variations in their encoded representations in terms of two dimensions: diversity shift and correlation shift. This characterization enables us to propose a new algorithm for integrating diverse pretrained models, not limited to the strongest models, in order to achieve enhanced out-of-distribution generalization performance. Our proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art empirical results on a variety of datasets, thus validating the benefits of utilizing diverse knowledge.},

Under only a finite second moment condition, approximating the following in reverse {KL} divergence in ε-accuracy can be done in {Õ}(d log(1/δ)/ε) steps: 1) the variance-δ {Gaussian} perturbation of any data distribution; 2) data distributions with 1/δ-smooth score functions.},

However, when people use {Shapley} values to explain the attribution of input variables of a deep neural network ({DNN}), it usually requires a very high computational cost to approximate relatively accurate {Shapley} values in real-world applications. Therefore, we propose a novel network architecture, the {HarsanyiNet}, which makes inferences on the input sample and simultaneously computes the exact {Shapley} values of the input variables in a single forward propagation. The {HarsanyiNet} is designed on the theoretical foundation that the {Shapley} value can be reformulated as the redistribution of {Harsanyi} interactions encoded by the network. The {HarsanyiNet} uses different intermediate-layer neurons to represent different {Harsanyi} interactions and is an interpretable network architecture which simultaneously performs model inference and computes exact {Shapley} values in a single forward propagation.},

Despite their empirical success, these models rely on labeled data and the theoretical properties of these models have yet to be fully understood. In this work, we propose a novel attention-based node embedding framework for graphs. Our framework builds upon a hierarchical kernel for multisets of subgraphs around nodes (e.g. neighborhoods) and each kernel leverages the geometry of a smooth statistical manifold to compare pairs of multisets, by "projecting" the multisets onto the manifold. By explicitly computing node embeddings with a manifold of {Gaussian} mixtures, our method leads to a new attention mechanism for neighborhood aggregation. We provide theoretical insights into generalizability and expressivity of our embeddings, contributing to a deeper understanding of attention-based {GNNs}.},

To tackle these challenges, we resort to the emerging scheme of Learning to Optimize (L2O), which discovers problem-specific efficient optimization algorithms through data-driven training. Our customized L2O framework for differentiable game theory problems, dubbed Learning to Play Games (L2PG), seeks a stable fixed point solution by predicting the fast update direction from the past trajectory, with a novel gradient stability-aware, sign-based loss function.},

Common spatial discretizations include meshes and meshless point clouds, where each degree-of-freedom corresponds to a location in space. While these explicit spatial correspondences are intuitive to model and understand, these representations are not necessarily optimal for accuracy, memory usage, or adaptivity. Keeping the classical temporal discretization unchanged, we explore INSR as an alternative spatial discretization, where spatial information is implicitly stored in the neural network weights. Our approach exhibits higher accuracy and lower memory consumption compared to traditional representations, while being intrinsically adaptive.},

However, the fundamental limits for learning in revealing POMDPs are much less understood. Our lower bounds scale polynomially in all relevant problem parameters in a multiplicative fashion, and achieve significantly smaller gaps against the current best upper bounds. For multi-step revealing POMDPs, we show that the latent state-space dependence is at least $\Omega(S^{1.5})$ in the PAC sample complexity, which is notably harder than the $\tilde{\Theta}(S)$ scaling for fully-observable MDPs.},

However, it is found in this paper to have limited ability in modeling some other types of data, such as count and non-negative continuous data, that are often highly sparse, skewed, heavy-tailed, and/or overdispersed. To this end, we propose learning to jump as a general recipe for generative modeling of various types of data. Using a forward count thinning process to construct learning objectives to train a deep neural network, it employs a reverse count thickening process to iteratively refine its generation through that network.},

  abstract     = {Pretraining on a large-scale corpus has become a standard method to build general language models (LMs). Adapting a model to new data distributions targeting different downstream tasks poses significant challenges. Naive fine-tuning may incur catastrophic forgetting when the over-parameterized LMs overfit the new data but fail to preserve the pretrained features. Lifelong learning (LLL) aims to enable information systems to learn from a continuous data stream across time. However, most prior work modifies the training recipe assuming a static fixed network architecture. We find that additional model capacity and proper regularization are key elements to achieving strong LLL performance. Thus, we propose Lifelong-MoE, an extensible MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) architecture that dynamically adds model capacity via adding experts with regularized pretraining.},

Our findings challenge conventional beliefs by showing that downsampling does not always harm generalization but can actually improve it in certain cases. We identify the optimal sketching size that minimizes out-of-sample prediction risks and demonstrate that the optimally sketched estimator exhibits stabler risk curves, eliminating the peaks of those for the full-sample estimator.},

Second, we analyze a simple selection method for RIT, which selects a particular value in the interval as the target value to train the model.

Specifically, we focus on the following setting: the machine learning service provider provides model copies for a set of customers. However, one of the customers conducted adversarial attacks to fool the system. Therefore, the investigator's objective is to identify the first compromised copy by collecting and analyzing evidence from only available adversarial examples. To make the tracing viable, we design a random mask watermarking mechanism to differentiate adversarial examples from different copies.},

As such, to efficiently serve the demands of several users in modern applications, it is imperative to identify the underlying users' clusters, i.e., the groups of users for which a single recommendation might be (near-)optimal. We propose CLUB-HG, a novel algorithm that integrates a game-theoretic approach into clustering inference. Our algorithm achieves Nash equilibrium at each inference step and discovers the underlying clusters. We also provide regret analysis within a standard linear stochastic noise setting.},

However, it remains largely unknown how the amount and type of feedback generally impact regret. To this end, we first consider the setting of bandit learning with extra observations; that is, in addition to the typical bandit feedback, the learner can freely make a total of $B_{\mathrm{ex}}$ extra observations. We fully characterize the minimax regret in this setting, which exhibits an interesting phase-transition phenomenon: when $B_{\mathrm{ex}} = O(T^{2/3})$, the regret remains $\widetilde{\Theta}(T^{2/3})$, but when $B_{\mathrm{ex}} = \Omega(T^{2/3})$, it becomes $\widetilde{\Theta}(T/\sqrt{B_{\mathrm{ex}}})$, which improves as the budget $B_{\mathrm{ex}}$ increases.},

In this work, we try to explain some of this success from a feature learning perspective. We focus our attention on classification problems in which each class may have multiple associated features (or views) that can be used to predict the class correctly. Our main theoretical results demonstrate that, for a non-trivial class of data distributions with two features per class, training a 2-layer convolutional network using empirical risk minimization can lead to learning only one feature for almost all classes while training with a specific instantiation of Mixup succeeds in learning both features for every class. We also show empirically that these theoretical insights extend to the practical settings of image benchmarks modified to have additional synthetic features.},

We propose Predicted Instance Neighborhood Aggregation (PINA), a data enhancement method for the general XMC problem that leverages beneficial side information. Unlike most existing XMC frameworks that treat labels and input instances as featureless indicators and independent entries, PINA extracts information from the label metadata and the correlations among training instances. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the consistent gain of PINA on various XMC tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods: PINA offers a gain in accuracy compared to standard XR-Transformers on five public benchmark datasets. Moreover, PINA achieves a ~5% gain in accuracy on the largest dataset LF-AmazonTitles-1.3M.},

  abstract     = {Adversarial training is well-known to produce high-quality neural network models that are empirically robust against adversarial perturbations. Nevertheless, once a model has been adversarially trained, one often desires a certification that the model is truly robust against all future attacks. Unfortunately, when faced with adversarially trained models, all existing approaches have significant trouble making certifications that are strong enough to be practically useful. Linear programming (LP) techniques in particular face a "convex relaxation barrier" that prevent them from making high-quality certifications, even after refinement with mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and branch-and-bound (BnB) techniques. In this paper, we propose a nonconvex certification technique, based on a low-rank restriction of a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. The nonconvex relaxation makes strong certifications comparable to much more expensive SDP methods, while optimizing over dramatically fewer variables comparable to much weaker LP methods. Despite nonconvexity, we show how off-the-shelf local optimization algorithms can be used to achieve and to certify global optimality in polynomial time. Our experiments find that the nonconvex relaxation almost completely closes the gap towards exact certification of adversarially trained models.},

To this end, it is crucial to find a true representation of the neural data, which is challenging due to the high complexity of behaviors and the low signal-to-ratio (SNR) of the signals. Here, we propose a novel unsupervised learning framework, Neural Latent Aligner (NLA), to find well-constrained, behaviorally relevant neural representations of complex behaviors. The key idea is to align representations across repeated trials to learn cross-trial consistent information. Furthermore, we propose a novel, fully differentiable time warping model (TWM) to resolve the temporal misalignment of trials. When applied to intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) of natural speaking, our model learns better representations for decoding behaviors, especially in lower dimensional space, than the baseline models. The time-warping model is empirically validated by measuring behavioral coherence between aligned trials. The proposed framework learns more cross-trial consistent representations than the baselines, and when visualized, the manifold reveals shared neural trajectories across trials.},

However, in practical cross-device FL systems, only a subset of clients that satisfy local criteria such as battery status, network connectivity, and maximum participation frequency requirements (to ensure privacy) are available for training at a given time. As a result, client availability follows a natural cyclic pattern. We provide (to our knowledge) the first theoretical framework to analyze the convergence of FedAvg with cyclic client participation with several different client optimizers such as GD, SGD, and shuffled SGD. Our analysis discovers that cyclic client participation can achieve a faster asymptotic convergence rate than vanilla FedAvg with uniform client participation under suitable conditions, providing valuable insights into the design of client sampling protocols.},

Here, we propose a new paradigm in efficient INR for videos based on the idea of strong lottery ticket (SLT) hypothesis (Zhou et al., 2019), which demonstrates the possibility of finding an accurate subnetwork mask, called supermask, for a randomly initialized classification network without weight training. Specifically, we train multiple supermasks with a hierarchical structure for a randomly initialized image-wise video representation model without weight updates.},

DDMs are built on a diffusion process that pushes data to the noise distribution and the models learn to denoise. In this paper, we establish the interpretation of DDMs in terms of image restoration (IR). Integrating IR literature allows us to use an alternative objective and diverse forward processes, not confining to the diffusion process. By imposing prior knowledge on the loss function grounded on MAP-based estimation, we eliminate the need for the expensive sampling of DDMs. Also, we propose a multi-scale training, which improves the performance compared to the diffusion process, by taking advantage of the flexibility of the forward process.},

  abstract     = {Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the safe deployment of deep neural network (DNN) classifiers. While a myriad of methods have focused on improving the performance of OOD detectors, a critical gap remains in interpreting their decisions. We help bridge this gap by providing explanations for OOD detectors based on learned high-level concepts. We first propose two new metrics for assessing the effectiveness of a particular set of concepts for explaining OOD detectors: 1) detection completeness, which quantifies the sufficiency of concepts for explaining an OOD-detector's decisions, and 2) concept separability, which captures the distributional separation between in-distribution and OOD data in the concept space. Based on these metrics, we propose an unsupervised framework for learning a set of concepts that satisfy the desired properties of high detection completeness and concept separability, and demonstrate its effectiveness in providing concept-based explanations for diverse off-the-shelf OOD detectors.},

In our setting, we are additionally given side information about G* as advice, e.g. a DAG G purported to be G*. We ask whether the learning algorithm can benefit from the advice when it is close to being correct, while still having worst-case guarantees even when the advice is arbitrarily bad. Our work is in the same space as the growing body of research on algorithms with predictions. When the advice is a DAG G, we design an adaptive search algorithm to recover G* whose intervention cost is at most O(max{1, log ψ}) times the cost for verifying G*; here, ψ is a distance measure between G and G* that is upper bounded by the number of edges that differ between the two graphs.},

Using observational data, one can typically only recover causal graphs up to a Markov equivalence class and additional assumptions or interventional data are needed for complete recovery. In this work, under some standard assumptions, we study causal graph discovery via adaptive interventions with node-dependent interventional costs. For this setting, we show that no algorithm can achieve an approximation guarantee that is asymptotically better than linear in the number of vertices with respect to the verification number; a well-established benchmark for adaptive search algorithms. Motivated by this negative result, we define a new benchmark that captures the worst-case interventional cost for any search algorithm. With respect to this new benchmark, we provide adaptive search algorithms that achieve logarithmic approximations under various settings: atomic, bounded size interventions and generalized cost.},

The methodology allows one to train a locally optimal particle filter prior to the data-assimilation procedure. Numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed approach can be orders of magnitude more efficient than state-of-the-art particle filters in the regime of highly informative observations, when the observations are extreme under the model, and if the state dimension is large.},

Importantly, they give substantial computational gains also for smaller graphs, while applied in downstream applications. Consequently, GRFs address the notoriously difficult problem of cubic (in the number of the nodes of the graph) time complexity of graph kernels algorithms. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of GRFs and an extensive empirical evaluation: from speed tests, through Frobenius relative error analysis to kmeans graph-clustering with graph kernels.},

Previous approaches tackled this problem by inferring a belief over task parameters, using variational inference methods. Motivated by recent successes of contrastive learning approaches in RL, such as contrastive predictive coding (CPC), we investigate whether contrastive methods can be used for learning Bayes-optimal behavior. We begin by proving that representations learned by CPC are indeed sufficient for Bayes optimality. Based on this observation, we propose a simple meta RL algorithm that uses CPC in lieu of variational belief inference. Our method, ContraBAR, achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art in domains with state-based observation and circumvents the computational toll of future observation reconstruction, enabling learning in domains with image-based observations.},

So, even retraining a fresh model after deletion of a record doesn't ensure its privacy. Secondly, unlearning algorithms that cache partial computations to speed up the processing can leak deleted information over a series of releases, violating the privacy of deleted records in the long run. To address these, we propose a sound deletion guarantee and show that the privacy of existing records is necessary for the privacy of deleted records.

We use Wasserstein barycenters as graph-level consensus to combat node-level correlations. We introduce a Wasserstein barycenter matching (WBM) layer that represents an input graph by Wasserstein distances between its MPNN-filtered node embeddings versus some learned class-wise barycenters. Theoretically, we show that the convergence rate of an MPNN with a WBM layer is controllable and independent of the dimensionality of the signal-generating space.

The method is established on the effectiveness of two specialized expert models and their synergy to localize anomalous regions from color and shape modalities. The first expert utilizes geometric information to probe 3D structural anomalies by modeling the implicit distance fields around local shapes. The second expert considers the 2D RGB features associated with the first expert to identify color appearance irregularities on the local shapes. The two experts are used to build dual memory banks from the anomaly-free training samples and perform shape-guided inference to pinpoint defects in the testing samples.},

The standard OPE no longer yields consistent estimators, and the standard OPL results in suboptimal policies. We formulate OPE and OPL using principal stratification under truncation by death and propose a survivor value function for a subpopulation whose outcomes are always defined regardless of treatment conditions. We establish a novel identification strategy under principal ignorability and derive the semiparametric efficiency bound of an OPE estimator. We propose multiply robust estimators for OPE and OPL and show that the proposed estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal even with flexible semi/nonparametric models for nuisance functions approximation.},

However, existing optimal transport methods ignore coherence structure in the data such as clusters, do not handle outliers well, and cannot integrate new data points. To address these drawbacks, we propose InfoOT, an information-theoretic extension of optimal transport that maximizes the mutual information between domains while minimizing geometric distances. The resulting objective can be formulated as a generalized optimal transport problem and solved efficiently by projected gradient descent. This formulation yields a new projection method that is robust to outliers and generalizes to unseen samples. Empirically, InfoOT improves the quality of alignments across benchmarks in domain adaptation, cross-domain retrieval, and single-cell alignment.},

We present a novel algorithm by which neural networks may implement composition for any finite group via mathematical representation theory. We then show that networks consistently learn this algorithm by reverse engineering model logits and weights, and confirm our understanding using ablations. By studying networks of differing architectures trained on various groups, we find mixed evidence for universality: using our algorithm, we can completely characterize the family of circuits and features that networks learn on this task, but for a given network the precise circuits learned -- as well as the order they develop -- are arbitrary.},

In the special, homogeneous, case where φ is the identity, we show that the equation reduces to a linear PDE and the limiting kernel agrees with the signature kernel of Salvi et al. (2021a). We name this new family of limiting kernels neural signature kernels. Finally, we show that in the infinite-depth regime, finite-width controlled ResNets converge in distribution to Neural CDEs with random vector fields which, depending on whether the weights are shared across layers, are either time-independent and Gaussian or behave like a matrix-valued Brownian motion.},

Considering multi-feature associations makes our method multivariate by design, which allows for the extraction of the hidden manifold underlying the features and avoids overfitting, facilitating few-sample feature selection. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on illustrative examples and several benchmarks, where our method shows higher accuracy in selecting informative features compared to competing methods.

While multiple learning techniques have been proposed in the literature, there is one particular setting that has not been explored yet: multi agent systems where agent identities remain anonymous. For instance, in financial markets labeled data that identifies market participant strategies is typically proprietary, and only the anonymous state-action pairs that result from the interaction of multiple market participants are publicly available. As a result, sequences of agent actions are not observable, restricting the applicability of existing work. We propose K-SHAP, a Policy Clustering algorithm that learns to group anonymous state-action pairs according to the agent policies. The method addresses the challenge of learning agent strategies from anonymous state-action pairs by proposing a novel policy-clustering method in which we group state-action observations that belong to agents sharing the same behavior or policy.},

We demonstrate that these {SDEs} are rigorous approximations of the real discrete-time algorithms (in a weak sense, scaling linearly with the learning rate).

To explore the mechanical differences between semi-supervised and noisy-labeled information in helping contrastive learning, we establish a unified theoretical framework of contrastive learning under weak supervision. By translating the weakly supervised information into a similarity graph under the framework of spectral clustering based on the posterior probability of weak labels, we establish the downstream classification error bound.

Among various dataset distillation methods, trajectory-matching-based methods ({MTT}) have achieved {SOTA} performance in many tasks, e.g., on {CIFAR-10/100}. However, due to exorbitant memory consumption when unrolling optimization through {SGD} steps, {MTT} fails to scale to large-scale datasets such as {ImageNet-1K}. To answer the question whether we can scale this {SOTA} method to {ImageNet-1K} and whether its effectiveness on {CIFAR} transfers to {ImageNet-1K}, we first propose a procedure to exactly compute the unrolled gradient with constant memory complexity, which allows us to scale {MTT} to {ImageNet-1K} seamlessly with ~6x reduction in memory footprint. We further discover that it is challenging for {MTT} to handle datasets with a large number of classes, and propose a novel soft label assignment that drastically improves its convergence. The resulting algorithm sets new {SOTA} on {ImageNet-1K}: we can scale up to 50 {IPCs} (Image Per Class) on {ImageNet-1K} on a single {GPU} (all previous methods can only scale to 2 {IPCs} on {ImageNet-1K}), leading to the best accuracy (only 5.9% accuracy drop against full dataset training) while utilizing only 4.2% of the number of data points.},

  abstract     = {Transformer-based detection and segmentation methods use a list of learned detection queries to retrieve information from the transformer network and learn to predict the location and category of one specific object from each query. We empirically find that random convex combinations of the learned queries are still good for the corresponding models. We then propose to learn a convex combination with dynamic coefficients based on the high-level semantics of the image. The generated dynamic queries, named as modulated queries, better capture the prior of object locations and categories in the different images. Equipped with our modulated queries, a wide range of {DETR}-based models achieve consistent and superior performance across multiple tasks (object detection, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation) and on different benchmarks ({MS COCO}, {CityScapes}, {YoutubeVIS}).},

  abstract     = {Personalized treatment effect estimates are often of interest in high-stakes applications -- thus, before deploying a model estimating such effects in practice, one needs to be sure that the best candidate from the ever-growing machine learning toolbox for this task was chosen. Unfortunately, due to the absence of counterfactual information in practice, it is usually not possible to rely on standard validation metrics for doing so, leading to a well-known model selection dilemma in the treatment effect estimation literature. While some solutions have recently been investigated, systematic understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different model selection criteria is still lacking. In this paper, instead of attempting to declare a global `winner', we therefore empirically investigate success- and failure modes of different selection criteria. We highlight that there is a complex interplay between selection strategies, candidate estimators and the data used for comparing them, and provide interesting insights into the relative (dis)advantages of different criteria alongside desiderata for the design of further illuminating empirical studies in this context.},

  abstract     = {Optimal transport ({OT}) theory focuses, among all maps $T:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ that can morph a probability measure onto another, on those that are the "thriftiest", i.e. such that the averaged cost $c(x, T(x))$ between $x$ and its image $T(x)$ be as small as possible. Many computational approaches have been proposed to estimate such Monge maps when $c$ is the $\ell_2^2$ distance, e.g., using entropic maps or neural networks. We propose a new model for transport maps, built on a family of translation invariant costs $c(x, y):=h(x-y)$, where $h:=\tfrac{1}{2}\|\cdot\|_2^2+τ$ and $τ$ is a regularizer. We propose a generalization of the entropic map suitable for $h$, and highlight a surprising link tying it with the Bregman centroids of the divergence $D_h$ generated by $h$, and the proximal operator of $τ$. We show that choosing a sparsity-inducing norm for $τ$ results in maps that apply Occam's razor to transport, in the sense that the displacement vectors $\Delta(x):= T(x)-x$ they induce are sparse, with a sparsity pattern that varies depending on $x$. We showcase the ability of our method to estimate meaningful {OT} maps for high-dimensional single-cell transcription data, in the $34000$-$d$ space of gene counts for cells, without using dimensionality reduction, thus retaining the ability to interpret all displacements at the gene level.},

Malicious clients may plant backdoors into the global model through uploading poisoned local models, causing images with specific patterns to be misclassified into some target labels. Backdoors planted by current attacks are not durable, and vanish quickly once the attackers stop model poisoning. In this paper, we investigate the connection between the durability of {FL} backdoors and the relationships between benign images and poisoned images (i.e., the images whose labels are flipped to the target label during local training). Specifically, benign images with the original and the target labels of the poisoned images are found to have key effects on backdoor durability. Consequently, we propose a novel attack, Chameleon, which utilizes contrastive learning to further amplify such effects towards a more durable backdoor. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chameleon significantly extends the backdoor lifespan over baselines by 1.2× ∼ 4×, for a wide range of image datasets, backdoor types, and model architectures.},

Generating new domains is one of the most effective approaches, yet its performance gain depends on the distribution discrepancy between the generated and target domains. Distributionally robust optimization is promising for tackling distribution discrepancy by exploring domains in an uncertainty set. However, the uncertainty set may be overwhelmingly large, leading to low-confidence prediction in DG because a large uncertainty set could introduce domains containing semantically different factors from training domains. To address this issue, we propose to perform moderately distributional exploration (MODE) for domain generalization. Specifically, MODE performs distribution exploration in an uncertainty subset that shares the same semantic factors with the training domains. We show that MODE can endow models with provable generalization performance on unknown target domains, and experimental results demonstrate that MODE achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.},

Classically, off-policy bias is corrected in a per-decision manner: past temporal-difference errors are re-weighted by the instantaneous Importance Sampling (IS) ratio after each action via eligibility traces. Many off-policy algorithms rely on this mechanism, along with differing protocols for cutting the IS ratios (traces) to combat the variance of the IS estimator. Unfortunately, once a trace has been cut, the effect cannot be easily reversed. This has led to the development of credit-assignment strategies that account for multiple past experiences at a time.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot learning aims to transfer the knowledge acquired from training on a diverse set of tasks to unseen tasks from the same task distribution with a limited amount of labeled data. The underlying requirement for effective few-shot generalization is to learn a good representation of the task manifold. This becomes more difficult when only a limited number of tasks are available for training. In such a few-task few-shot setting, it is beneficial to explicitly preserve the local neighborhoods from the task manifold and exploit this to generate artificial tasks for training. To this end, we introduce the notion of interval bounds from the provably robust training literature to few-shot learning. The interval bounds are used to characterize neighborhoods around the training tasks. These neighborhoods can then be preserved by minimizing the distance between a task and its respective bounds. We then use a novel strategy to artificially form new tasks for training by interpolating between the available tasks and their respective interval bounds. We apply our framework to both model-agnostic meta-learning as well as prototype-based metric-learning paradigms. The efficacy of our proposed approach is evident from the improved performance on several datasets from diverse domains compared to current methods.},

However, existing Bayesian optimization techniques fail to effectively exploit common and often-neglected problem structure such as decoupled evaluations, where objectives can be queried independently from one another and each may consume different resources, or multi-fidelity evaluations, where lower fidelity-proxies of the objectives can be evaluated at lower cost. In this work, we propose a general one-step lookahead acquisition function based on the Knowledge Gradient that addresses the complex question of what to evaluate when and at which design points in a principled Bayesian decision-theoretic fashion. Hence, our approach naturally addresses decoupled, multi-fidelity, and standard multi-objective optimization settings in a unified Bayesian decision making framework. By construction, our method is the one-step Bayes-optimal policy for hypervolume maximization.},

Crucially, the Laplacian encode both the homology of a data set, and some additional geometric information not captured by the homology. Here, we provide the first investigation into the efficacy of the persistence Laplacian as an embedding of data for downstream classification and regression tasks.

This is reflected in several recent studies on characterizing the failure modes of PINNs, although a thorough understanding of the connection between PINN failure modes and sampling strategies is missing. In this paper, we provide a novel perspective of failure modes of PINNs by hypothesizing that training PINNs relies on successful propagation of solution from initial and/or boundary condition points to interior points. We show that PINNs with poor sampling strategies can get stuck at trivial solutions if there are propagation failures, characterized by highly imbalanced PDE residual fields. We propose a novel Retain-Resample-Release (R3) sampling algorithm to mitigate propagation failures with minimal computational overhead. The R3 algorithm incrementally accumulates collocation points in regions of high PDE residuals, mitigating these failures with minimal computational overhead.},

These problems involve minimizing a given loss or score function, subject to a non-convex continuous constraint that penalizes the presence of cycles in a graph. In this work, we delve into the optimization challenges associated with this class of non-convex programs. To address these challenges, we propose a bi-level algorithm that leverages the non-convex constraint in a novel way. The outer level of the algorithm optimizes over topological orders by iteratively swapping pairs of nodes within the topological order of a DAG. A key innovation of our approach is the development of an effective method for generating a set of candidate swapping pairs for each iteration. At the inner level, given a topological order, we utilize off-the-shelf solvers that can handle linear constraints. The key advantage of our proposed algorithm is that it is guaranteed to find a local minimum or a KKT point under weaker conditions compared to previous work and finds solutions with lower scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of achieving a better score. Additionally, our method can also be used as a post-processing algorithm to significantly improve the score of other algorithms.},

Recently proposed evidential neural networks explicitly account for different uncertainties by treating the network's outputs as evidence to parameterize the Dirichlet distribution, and achieve impressive performance in uncertainty estimation. However, for high data uncertainty samples but annotated with the one-hot label, the evidence-learning process for those mislabeled classes is over-penalized and remains hindered. To address this problem, we propose a novel method, Fisher Information-based Evidential Deep Learning. In particular, we introduce Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to measure the informativeness of evidence carried by each sample, according to which we can dynamically reweight the objective loss terms to make the network more focused on the representation learning of uncertain classes. The generalization ability of our network is further improved by optimizing the PAC-Bayesian bound. As demonstrated empirically, our proposed method consistently outperforms traditional EDL-related algorithms in multiple uncertainty estimation tasks, especially in the more challenging few-shot classification settings.},

In practice, an advertiser does not have control over, and thus cannot globally optimize, which individual ad auctions she participates in for each channel, and instead authorizes a channel to procure impressions on her behalf: the advertiser can only utilize two levers on each channel, namely setting a per-channel budget and per-channel target ROI. In this work, we first analyze the effectiveness of each of these levers for solving the advertiser's global multi-channel problem. An efficient learning algorithm is presented that produces per-channel budgets whose resulting conversion approximates that of the global optimal problem, and the paper shows that these results hold for both single-item and multi-item auctions.},

  abstract     = {Spiking neural networks provide an alternative solution to conventional artificial neural networks with energy-saving and high-efficiency characteristics after hardware implantation. However, due to its non-differentiable activation function and the temporally delayed accumulation in outputs, the direct training of SNNs is extraordinarily tough even adopting a surrogate gradient to mimic the backpropagation. For SNN training, this non-differentiability causes the intrinsic gradient error that would be magnified through layerwise backpropagation, especially through multiple layers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reducing gradient error from a new perspective called surrogate module learning (SML). Surrogate module learning tries to construct a shortcut path to back-propagate more accurate gradient to a certain SNN part utilizing the surrogate modules. Then, we develop a new loss function for concurrently training the network and enhancing the surrogate modules' surrogate capacity. We demonstrate that when the outputs of surrogate modules are close to the SNN output, the fraction of the gradient error drops significantly. Our method consistently and significantly enhances the performance of SNNs on all experiment datasets, including CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, and ES-ImageNet. For example, for spiking ResNet-34 architecture on ImageNet, we increased the SNN accuracy by 3.46\%.},

While recent methods study prediction confidence, this work reports prediction dispersity is another informative cue. Confidence reflects whether the individual prediction is certain; dispersity indicates how the overall predictions are distributed across all categories. Our key insight is that a well-performing model should give predictions with high confidence and high dispersity. That is, we need to consider both properties so as to make more accurate estimates. To this end, we use the nuclear norm that has been shown to be effective in characterizing both properties. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of nuclear norm for various models (e.g., ViT and ConvNeXt), different datasets (e.g., ImageNet and CUB-200), and diverse types of distribution shifts (e.g., style shift and reproduction shift). We show that the nuclear norm is more accurate and robust in accuracy estimation than existing methods.

  abstract     = {Reliable application of machine learning is of primary importance to the practical deployment of deep learning methods. A fundamental challenge is that models are often unreliable due to overconfidence. In this paper, we estimate a model's reliability by measuring the agreement between its latent space, and the latent space of a foundation model. However, it is challenging to measure the agreement between two different latent spaces due to their incoherence, e.g., arbitrary rotations and different dimensionality. To overcome this incoherence issue, we design a neighborhood agreement measure between latent spaces and find that this agreement is surprisingly well-correlated with the reliability of a model's predictions. Further, we show that fusing neighborhood agreement into a model's predictive confidence in a post-hoc way significantly improves its reliability.},

Training and deploying large models require sophisticated hardware and incur significantly higher costs. Thus, model compression is a widely explored approach to solving the problem. However, state-of-the-art techniques fall short in one or more desirable aspects of compression -- for instance, pruning does not reduce memory for training, quantization can only provide up to 32x compression, HashedNet is cache-inefficient, etc. This paper proposes a model-agnostic, cache-friendly, and hardware-aware model compression approach: Random Operation Access Specific Tile (ROAST) hashing. ROAST collapses the parameters by clubbing them through a lightweight mapping. While clubbing these parameters, ROAST utilizes cache hierarchies by aligning the memory access pattern with the parameter access pattern.},

Hyperbolic spaces have suitable geometric properties to embed tree-like data, so MERU can better capture the underlying hierarchy in image-text datasets.

For example, a 30B 8-bit model and a 60B 4-bit model have the same number of bits but may have very different zero-shot accuracies. In this work, we study this trade-off by developing inference scaling laws of zero-shot performance in Large Language Models (LLMs) to determine the bit-precision and model size that maximizes zero-shot performance. We run more than 35,000 experiments with 16-bit inputs and k-bit parameters to examine which zero-shot quantization methods improve scaling for 3 to 8-bit precision at scales of 19M to 176B parameters across the LLM families BLOOM, OPT, NeoX/Pythia, and GPT-2.},

Merits conditioned on observable features are always uncertain, a fact that is exacerbated by the widespread use of machine learning algorithms to infer merit from the observables.

We propose a Linearized Activation Function TRick (LAFTR) and derive an efficient approximation to FSD for ReLU neural networks. The key idea is to approximate the architecture as a linear network with stochastic gating. Despite requiring only one parameter per unit of the network, our approach outcompetes other parametric approximations with larger memory requirements. Applied to continual learning, our parametric approximation is competitive with state-of-the-art nonparametric approximations, which require storing many training examples.

We also analyze the performance of recalibration, conformal, and regularization methods to enhance probabilistic calibration. Additionally, we introduce novel differentiable recalibration and regularization methods, uncovering new insights into their effectiveness. Our findings reveal that regularization methods offer a favorable tradeoff between calibration and sharpness. Post-hoc methods exhibit superior probabilistic calibration, which we attribute to the finite-sample coverage guarantee of conformal prediction.

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to eliminate these restrictive assumptions. Our algorithm is based on extended value iteration with a fine-grained variance-aware confidence set, where the variance is estimated recursively from high-order moments. Our algorithm achieves an Õ(dB*√K) regret bound, where d is the dimension of the feature mapping in the linear transition kernel, B* is the upper bound of the total cumulative cost for the optimal policy, and K is the number of episodes. Our regret upper bound matches the Ω(dB*√K) lower bound of linear mixture SSPs, which suggests that our algorithm is nearly minimax optimal.},

That is, the benchmark algorithm need not perform well when potentially extreme points are added to D; it only has to handle the removal of a small number of real data points that already exist. This makes our benchmark significantly stronger than those proposed in prior work.

Since there is often not a unique solution optimal for all tasks, practitioners have to balance tradeoffs between tasks' performance, and resort to optimality in the Pareto sense. Most MTL methodologies either completely neglect this aspect, and instead of aiming at learning a Pareto Front, produce one solution predefined by their optimization schemes, or produce diverse but discrete solutions. Recent approaches parameterize the Pareto Front via neural networks, leading to complex mappings from tradeoff to objective space. In this paper, we conjecture that the Pareto Front admits a linear parameterization in parameter space, which leads us to propose Pareto Manifold Learning, an ensembling method in weight space. Our approach produces a continuous Pareto Front in a single training run, that allows to modulate the performance on each task during inference. Experiments on multi-task learning benchmarks, ranging from image classification to tabular datasets and scene understanding, show that Pareto Manifold Learning outperforms state-of-the-art single-point algorithms, while learning a better Pareto parameterization than multi-point baselines.},

To address these challenges when training vanilla {RCRL} architectures, we propose Bayesian Reparameterized {RCRL} ({BR-RCRL}), a novel set of inductive biases for {RCRL} inspired by Bayes' theorem. {BR-RCRL} removes a core obstacle preventing vanilla {RCRL} from generalizing on high {RTG} inputs -- a tendency that the model treats different {RTG} inputs as independent values, which we term "{RTG} Independence". {BR-RCRL} also allows us to design an accompanying adaptive inference method, which maximizes total returns while avoiding {OOD} queries that yield unpredictable behaviors in vanilla {RCRL} methods.

  abstract     = {Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent ({SGD}) is an emerging neural network training approach that enables multiple agents to train a model collaboratively and simultaneously. Rather than using a central parameter server to collect gradients from all the agents, each agent keeps a copy of the model parameters and communicates with a small number of other agents to exchange model updates. Their communication, governed by the communication topology and gossip weight matrices, facilitates the exchange of model updates. The state-of-the-art approach uses the dynamic one-peer exponential-2 topology, achieving faster training times and improved scalability than the ring, grid, torus, and hypercube topologies. However, this approach requires a power-of-2 number of agents, which is impractical at scale. In this paper, we remove this restriction and propose Decentralized {SGD} with Communication-optimal Exact Consensus Algorithm ({DSGD-CECA}), which works for any number of agents while still achieving state-of-the-art properties. In particular, {DSGD-CECA} incurs a unit per-iteration communication overhead and an $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ transient iteration complexity. Our proof is based on newly discovered properties of gossip weight matrices and a novel approach to combine them with {DSGD}'s convergence analysis. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of {DSGD-CECA}.},

We then develop MaskCLIP, a Transformer-based approach with a MaskCLIP Visual Encoder, which is an encoder-only module that seamlessly integrates mask tokens with a pre-trained ViT CLIP model for semantic/instance segmentation and class prediction. MaskCLIP learns to efficiently and effectively utilize pre-trained partial/dense CLIP features within the MaskCLIP Visual Encoder that avoids the time-consuming student-teacher training process. MaskCLIP outperforms previous methods for semantic/instance/panoptic segmentation on ADE20K and PASCAL datasets. We show qualitative illustrations for MaskCLIP with online custom categories.},

They mainly utilize the denoising framework, which leverages the Langevin dynamics process for image sampling. Recently, the guidance method has modified this process to add conditional information to achieve a controllable generator. However, the current guidance on denoising processes suffers from the trade-off between diversity, image quality, and conditional information. In this work, we propose to view this guidance sampling process from a gradient view, where image pixels are treated as parameters being optimized, and each mathematical term in the sampling process represents one update direction. This perspective reveals more insights into the conflict problems between updated directions on the pixels, which cause the trade-off as mentioned previously. We investigate the conflict problems and propose to solve them by a simple projection method. The experimental results evidently improve over different baselines on datasets with various resolutions.},

This significantly reduces the overall arithmetic complexity of second-order optimization schemes. By using the cubic regularization technique, we establish fast global convergence of our method to a second-order stationary point, while the Hessian does not need to be updated each iteration. For convex problems, we justify global and local superlinear rates for lazy Newton steps with quadratic regularization, which is easier to compute. The optimal frequency for updating the Hessian is once every $d$ iterations, where $d$ is the dimension of the problem. This provably improves the total arithmetic complexity of second-order algorithms by a factor $\sqrt{d}$.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the study of linear misspecified bandits has generated intriguing implications of the hardness of learning in bandits and reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, Du et al. (2020) shows that even if a learner is given linear features in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that approximate the rewards in a bandit or RL with a uniform error of $\varepsilon$, searching for an $O(\varepsilon)$-optimal action requires pulling at least $\Omega(\exp(d))$ queries. Furthermore, Lattimore et al. (2020) show that a degraded $O(\varepsilon\sqrt{d})$-optimal solution can be learned within $\operatorname{poly}(d/\varepsilon)$ queries. Yet it is unknown whether a structural assumption on the ground-truth parameter, such as sparsity, could break $\varepsilon\sqrt{d}$ barrier. In this paper, we address this question by showing that algorithms can obtain $O(\varepsilon)$-optimal actions by querying $\tilde{O}(\exp(m\varepsilon))$ actions, where $m$ is the sparsity parameter, removing the $\exp(d)$-dependence. We further show (with an information-theoretical lower bound) that this is the best possible if one demands an error $ m^{\delta}\varepsilon$ for $0<\delta<1$. We further show that $\operatorname{poly}(m/\varepsilon)$ bounds are possible when the linear features are "good". These results provide a nearly complete picture of how sparsity can help in misspecified bandit learning and provide a deeper understanding of when linear features are "useful" for bandit and reinforcement learning with misspecification.},

To evaluate the graph structural noise in real data, we propose edge signal-to-noise ratio (ESNR), a novel metric evaluating overall edge noise level with respect to data features or labels based on random matrix theory. We have found striking concordance between the proposed ESNR metric and the GNN performance in various simulated and real data. To reduce the effect of the noise, we propose GPS (Graph Propensity Score) graph rewiring, which estimates the edge likelihood for rewiring data graphs based on self-supervised link prediction. We provide a theoretical guarantee for GPS graph rewiring and demonstrate its efficacy by comprehensive benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Vision Transformers (ViTs) have continuously achieved new milestones in object detection. However, the considerable computation and memory burden compromise their efficiency and generalization of deployment on resource-constraint devices. Besides, efficient transformer-based detectors designed by existing works can hardly achieve a realistic speedup, especially on multi-core processors (e.g., GPUs). The main issue is that the current literature solely concentrates on building algorithms with minimal computation, oblivious that the practical latency can also be affected by the memory access cost and the degree of parallelism. Therefore, we propose SpeedDETR, a novel speed-aware transformer for end-to-end object detectors, achieving high-speed inference on multiple devices. Specifically, we design a latency prediction model which can directly and accurately estimate the network latency by analyzing network properties, hardware memory access pattern, and degree of parallelism. Following the effective local-to-global visual modeling process and the guidance of the latency prediction model, we build our hardware-oriented architecture design and develop a new family of SpeedDETR. Experiments on the MS COCO dataset show SpeedDETR outperforms current DETR-based methods on Tesla V100. Even acceptable speed inference can be achieved on edge GPUs.},

To address this issue, we propose a diversity-enhancing generative network (DEG-Net) for the FHA problem, which can generate diverse unlabeled data with the help of a kernel independence measure: the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). Specifically, DEG-Net generates data by minimizing the HSIC value (i.e., maximizing the independence) among the semantic features of the generated data. The semantic features are obtained from the hidden-layer outputs of the well-trained source hypothesis. HSIC can be easily estimated by data samples, making it computationally efficient for measuring dependency among generated unlabeled data. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

Meanwhile, we found it is not handled properly in the original ELECTRA design, leading to the sensitivity issue. Specifically, since adaptive optimizers like Adam will cripple the weighing of individual losses in the joint optimization, the original design fails to control the generator training effectively. To regain control over the generator, we modularize the generator optimization by decoupling the generator optimizer and discriminator optimizer completely, instead of simply relying on the weighted objective combination. Our simple technique reduced the sensitivity of ELECTRA training significantly and obtains considerable performance gain compared to the original design.},

Existing distributionally robust algorithms have focused on adaptively truncating/down-weighting the less informative (i.e., label-sparse in our context) samples. To exploit data features of label-sparse samples more efficiently, we propose an adaptively weighted online optimization algorithm -- AdaWAC -- to incorporate data augmentation consistency regularization in sample reweighting.

Specifically, we represent symmetries with the subgroups of the dihedral group and search for the optimal symmetry in structured subgroups. Then robots are designed under the searched symmetry.

As a result, such methods are inapplicable to downlink (i.e., from the parameter server to clients) compression in the cross-device setting, where heterogeneous clients may appear only once during training and thus must download the model parameters. Accordingly, we propose DoCoFL -- a new framework for downlink compression in the cross-device setting. Importantly, DoCoFL can be seamlessly combined with many uplink compression schemes, rendering it suitable for bi-directional compression. Through extensive evaluation, we show that DoCoFL offers significant bi-directional bandwidth reduction while achieving competitive accuracy to that of a baseline without any compression.},

But, animals do generalise, wielding Occam's razor to select a parsimonious explanation of their observations. How they do this is called their inductive bias, and it is implicitly built into the operation of animals' neural circuits. This relationship between an observed circuit and its inductive bias is a useful explanatory window for neuroscience, allowing design choices to be understood normatively. However, it is generally very difficult to map circuit structure to inductive bias. Here, we present a neural network tool to bridge this gap. The tool meta-learns the inductive bias by learning functions that a neural circuit finds easy to generalise, since easy-to-generalise functions are exactly those the circuit chooses to explain incomplete data.},

While latent GP models provide a principled and powerful solution in theory, the intractable posterior in non-conjugate settings necessitates approximate inference schemes, which may lack scalability. In this work, we propose cvHM, a general inference framework for latent GP models leveraging Hida-Matérn kernels and conjugate computation variational inference (CVI). With cvHM, we are able to perform variational inference of latent neural trajectories with linear time complexity for arbitrary likelihoods. The reparameterization of stationary kernels using Hida-Matérn GPs helps us connect the latent variable models that encode prior assumptions through dynamical systems to those that encode trajectory assumptions through GPs.},

We propose embodied language models to directly incorporate real-world continuous sensor modalities into language models and thereby establish the link between words and percepts. Input to our embodied language model are multimodal sentences that interleave visual, continuous state estimation, and textual input encodings. We train these encodings end-to-end, in conjunction with a pre-trained large language model, for multiple embodied tasks including sequential robotic manipulation planning, visual question answering, and captioning. Our evaluations show that PaLM-E, a single large embodied multimodal model, can address a variety of embodied reasoning tasks, from a variety of observation modalities, on multiple embodiments, and further, exhibits positive transfer: the model benefits from diverse joint training across internet-scale language, vision, and visual-language domains. Our largest model with 562B parameters, in addition to being trained on robotics tasks, is a visual-language generalist with state-of-the-art performance on OK-VQA, and retains generalist language capabilities with increasing scale.},

They can be interpreted as learning the gradients of a time-varying sequence of log-probability density functions. This interpretation has motivated classifier-based and classifier-free guidance as methods for post-hoc control of diffusion models. In this work, we build upon these ideas using the score-based interpretation of diffusion models, and explore alternative ways to condition, modify, and reuse diffusion models for tasks involving compositional generation and guidance. In particular, we investigate why certain types of composition fail using current techniques and present a number of solutions. We conclude that the sampler (not the model) is responsible for this failure and propose new samplers, inspired by MCMC, which enable successful compositional generation. Further, we propose an energy-based parameterization of diffusion models which enables the use of new compositional operators and more sophisticated, Metropolis-corrected samplers. Intriguingly we find these samplers lead to notable improvements in compositional generation across a wide set of problems such as classifier-guided ImageNet modeling and compositional text-to-image generation.},

First, based on a pleasant observation that (under certain conditions) the SWF of joint distributions coincides with those of conditional distributions, we propose Conditional Sliced-Wasserstein Flow (CSWF), a simple yet effective extension of SWF that enables nonparametric conditional modeling. Second, we introduce appropriate inductive biases of images into SWF with two techniques inspired by local connectivity and multiscale representation in vision research, which greatly improve the efficiency and quality of modeling images. With all the improvements, we achieve generative performance comparable with many deep parametric generative models on both conditional and unconditional tasks in a purely nonparametric fashion, demonstrating its great potential.},

By analyzing the squared prediction risk of ridge ensembles as a function of the explicit penalty λ and the limiting subsample aspect ratio φₛ (the ratio of the feature size to the subsample size), they characterize contours in the (λ, φₛ)-plane at any achievable risk. As a consequence, they prove that the risk of the optimal full ridgeless ensemble (fitted on all possible subsamples) matches that of the optimal ridge predictor. In addition, they prove strong uniform consistency of generalized cross-validation (GCV) over the subsample sizes for estimating the prediction risk of ridge ensembles. This allows for GCV-based tuning of full ridgeless ensembles without sample splitting and yields a predictor whose risk matches optimal ridge risk.},

However, recent supervised multi-modal late-fusion training approaches still suffer from insufficient learning of uni-modal features on each modality.

We describe a method that uses background knowledge from text corpora to shape exploration. This method, called ELLM (Exploring with LLMs) rewards an agent for achieving goals suggested by a language model prompted with a description of the agent's current state. By leveraging large-scale language model pretraining, ELLM guides agents toward human-meaningful and plausibly useful behaviors without requiring a human in the loop. We evaluate ELLM in the Crafter game environment and the Housekeep robotic simulator, showing that ELLM-trained agents have better coverage of common-sense behaviors during pretraining and usually match or improve performance on a range of downstream tasks.},

In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of diffusion models to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), a common privacy concern. Our results indicate that existing MIAs designed for GANs or VAE are largely ineffective on diffusion models, either due to inapplicable scenarios (e.g., requiring the discriminator of GANs) or inappropriate assumptions (e.g., closer distances between synthetic samples and member samples). To address this gap, we propose Step-wise Error Comparing Membership Inference (SecMI), a query-based MIA that infers memberships by assessing the matching of forward process posterior estimation at each timestep. SecMI follows the common overfitting assumption in MIA where member samples normally have smaller estimation errors, compared with hold-out samples. We consider both the standard diffusion models, e.g., DDPM, and the text-to-image diffusion models, e.g., Latent Diffusion Models and Stable Diffusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods precisely infer the membership with high confidence on both of the two scenarios across multiple different datasets.

The former is used to build multi-level observations ranging from concrete to abstract, while the latter is used to generate more concrete observations gradually. The model includes a graph-enhanced decoder to capture the semantic relationships among words at different levels of observation. We provide theoretical analysis based on the principle of information theory, showing how the proposed model can alleviate the well-known latent variable collapse problem.

Yet SSL is typically evaluated using a single metric: linear probing on ImageNet. This does not provide much insight into why or when a model is better, now how to improve it. To address this, we propose an SSL risk decomposition, which generalizes the classical supervised approximation-estimation decomposition by considering errors arising from the representation learning step. Our decomposition consists of four error components: approximation, representation usability, probe generalization, and encoder generalization. We provide efficient estimators for each component and use them to analyze the effect of 30 design choices on 169 SSL vision models evaluated on ImageNet. Our analysis gives valuable insights for designing and using SSL models. For example, it highlights the main sources of error and shows how to improve SSL in specific settings (full- vs few-shot) by trading off error components.

Our main result is a randomized algorithm that maintains a solution with expected approximation ratio 4 using a data structure with O(k log^2 n) amortized update time, where k is the rank of the matroid and n is the number of elements. This is the first algorithm that provides sublinear update time in the fully dynamic setting for this problem. We also provide a lower bound of Omega(k) for the update time of any algorithm that maintains any O(1)-approximation. Additionally, we present experimental results on synthetic and real-world data that show the practical efficiency of our algorithm.},

This regret bound is asymptotically optimal in T due to a lower bound of Kleinberg and Leighton.

It determines how positive samples are defined and, ultimately, the quality of the learned representation. In this work, we open the door to new perspectives for CL by integrating prior knowledge, given either by generative models -- viewed as prior representations -- or weak attributes in the positive and negative sampling. We use kernel theory to propose a novel loss, called decoupled uniformity, that i) allows the integration of prior knowledge and ii) removes the positive-negative coupling in the original InfoNCE loss. We draw a connection between contrastive learning and the conditional mean embedding theory to derive tight bounds on the downstream classification loss. In an unsupervised setting, we empirically demonstrate that CL benefits from generative models to improve its representation both on natural and medical images. In a weakly supervised setting, our framework outperforms other methods.},

The density matrix ρ (fundamental for describing such systems) is high-dimensional, so we can attempt to use deep generative neural networks to model it. However, the complex-valued nature of ρ, normalization constraints, and its complicated dynamics prohibit a seamless connection to the recent advances in deep generative modeling. We overcome this fundamental limitation by utilizing a reformulation of open quantum system dynamics to a partial differential equation (PDE) for a corresponding probability distribution Q, the Husimi Q function. Thus, we can model the Q function seamlessly with off-the-shelf deep generative models such as normalizing flows. Our method, called Q-Flow, outperforms both state-of-the-art classical and quantum solvers on challenging dynamics tasks, while offering unique capabilities such as learning from noisy data, building surrogate models, and computing observables.},

Existing neural circuit models of adaptive whitening operate by modifying synaptic interactions; however, such modifications would seem both too slow and insufficiently reversible. Motivated by the extensive neuroscience literature on gain modulation, we propose an alternative model that adaptively whitens its responses by modulating the gains of individual neurons. Starting from a novel whitening objective, we derive an online algorithm that whitens its outputs by adjusting the marginal variances of an overcomplete set of projections. We map the algorithm onto a recurrent neural network with fixed synaptic weights and gain-modulating interneurons. Sign-constraining the gains improves robustness of the network to ill-conditioned inputs. A generalization of the circuit achieves a form of local whitening in convolutional populations, such as those found throughout the visual or auditory systems.},

Recently, several studies have attempted to analyze the generalization error in such settings by using tools from fractal geometry. While these works have successfully introduced new mathematical tools to apprehend generalization, they heavily rely on a Lipschitz continuity assumption, which in general does not hold for neural networks and might make the bounds vacuous. In this work, we address this issue and prove fractal geometry-based generalization bounds without requiring any Lipschitz assumption. To achieve this goal, we build upon a classical covering argument in learning theory and introduce a data-dependent fractal dimension. Despite introducing technical complications, this new notion allows us to control the generalization error along with certain mutual information terms. Finally, we make a rigorous connection between the proposed data-dependent dimension and topological data analysis tools, which enables us to compute the dimension in a numerically efficient way.},

By introducing a custom attention block we are able to incorporate properties of stochastic processes, such as exchangeability, directly into the NDP's architecture. We empirically show that NDPs can capture functional distributions close to the true Bayesian posterior, demonstrating that they can successfully emulate the behaviour of Gaussian processes and surpass the performance of neural processes. NDPs enable a variety of downstream tasks, including regression, implicit hyperparameter marginalisation, non-Gaussian posterior prediction and global optimisation.},

EMPSNs can learn high-dimensional simplex features in graphs (e.g. triangles), and use the increase of geometric information of higher-dimensional simplices in an E(n) equivariant fashion. EMPSNs simultaneously generalize E(n) Equivariant Graph Neural Networks to a topologically more elaborate counterpart and provide an approach for including geometric information in Message Passing Simplicial Networks, thereby serving as a proof of concept for combining geometric and topological information in graph learning. The results indicate that EMPSNs can leverage the benefits of both approaches, leading to a general increase in performance when compared to either method individually, being on par with state-of-the-art approaches for learning on geometric graphs. Moreover, the results suggest that incorporating geometric information serves as an effective measure against over-smoothing in message passing networks, especially when operating on high-dimensional simplicial structures.},

Towards this, we harness the performative nature of recommendation, and show how learning can incentivize strategic content creators to create diverse content. Our approach relies on a novel form of regularization that anticipates strategic changes to content, and penalizes for content homogeneity. We provide analytic and empirical results that demonstrate when and how diversity can be incentivized, and experimentally demonstrate the utility of our approach on synthetic and semi-synthetic data.},

In this paper, we show that hyperparameter choices in RL can significantly affect the agent's final performance and sample efficiency, and that the hyperparameter landscape can strongly depend on the tuning seed which may lead to overfitting. We therefore propose adopting established best practices from AutoML, such as the separation of tuning and testing seeds, as well as principled hyperparameter optimization (HPO) across a broad search space. We demonstrate that adopting HPO tools and practices has the potential to make RL research more efficient, accessible and reproducible, comparing multiple state-of-the-art HPO tools on a range of RL algorithms and environments to their hand-tuned counterparts, demonstrating that HPO approaches often have higher performance and lower compute overhead.},

Moreover, some GNNs suffer from over-smoothing, limiting their depth. On the other hand, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can learn diverse propagation filters, and phenomena like over-smoothing are typically not apparent in CNNs. In this paper, we bridge these gaps by incorporating trainable channel-wise weighting factors ω to learn and mix multiple smoothing and sharpening propagation operators at each layer. Our generic method is called ωGNN, and is easy to implement. We study two variants: ωGCN and ωGAT. For ωGCN, we theoretically analyse its behaviour and the impact of ω on the obtained node features. Our experiments confirm these findings, demonstrating and explaining how both variants do not over-smooth.},

In the paper at ICML 2006, Beygelzimer, Kakade, and Langford introduced a cover tree and attempted to prove that this tree can be built in O(n log n) time while the nearest neighbor search can be done O(n log m) time with a hidden dimensionality factor. In 2015, section 5.3 of Curtin's PhD pointed out that the proof of the latter claim can have a serious gap in time complexity estimation. A paper at TopoInVis 2022 reported explicit counterexamples for a key step in the proofs of both claims. This paper fills a substantial gap in the past proofs of time complexity by defining a simpler compressed cover tree on the reference set R. The first new algorithm constructs a compressed cover tree in O(n log n) time. The second new algorithm finds all k-nearest neighbors of all points from Q using a compressed cover tree in time O(m(k+log n)log k) with a hidden dimensionality factor depending on point distributions of the given sets R,Q but not on their sizes.},

Previous work has used perturbation-based saliency methods to tackle this issue, perturbing an input using a trainable mask to discover which features at which times are driving the predictions. However these methods introduce fixed perturbations, inspired from similar methods on static data, while there seems to be little motivation to do so on temporal data. In this work, we aim to explain predictions by learning not only masks, but also associated perturbations.},

We show that the regime of the mapping of states to losses determines the complexity of the problem, irrespective of whether the mapping of actions to states is stochastic or adversarial. If the mapping of states to losses is adversarial, then the regret rate is of order $\sqrt{(K+d)T}$ (within log factors), where $T$ is the time horizon and $d$ is a fixed delay. This matches the regret rate of a $K$-armed bandit with delayed feedback and without intermediate observations, implying that intermediate observations are not helpful. However, if the mapping of states to losses is stochastic, we show that the regret grows at a rate of $\sqrt{(K+\min\{|S|,d\})T}$ (within log factors), implying that if the number $|S|$ of states is smaller than the delay, then intermediate observations help.},

For this reason, applications of spherical CNNs have so far been limited to small problems that can be approached with low model capacity. In this work, we show how spherical CNNs can be scaled for much larger problems. To achieve this, we make critical improvements including novel variants of common model components, an implementation of core operations to exploit hardware accelerator characteristics, and application-specific input representations that exploit the properties of our model.},

A second class of methods, known as critic regularization, perform many steps of policy improvement with a regularized objective. These methods typically require more compute but have appealing lower-bound guarantees. In this paper, we draw a connection between these methods: applying a multi-step critic regularization method with a regularization coefficient of 1 yields the same policy as one-step RL.},

This enables samplers to discover an alternative and more efficient sampling shortcut, deviating from the backward diffusion process. Inspired by a control perspective, we propose a new algorithm SFT-PG: Shortcut Fine-Tuning with Policy Gradient, and prove that under certain assumptions, gradient descent of diffusion models with respect to IPM is equivalent to performing policy gradient. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize reinforcement learning (RL) methods to train diffusion models. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our fine-tuning method can further enhance existing fast DDPM samplers, resulting in sample quality comparable to or even surpassing that of the full-step model across various datasets.},

We propose a new method for inference in Bayesian GPSSMs, which overcomes the drawbacks of previous approaches, namely over-simplified assumptions, and high computational requirements. Our method is based on free-form variational inference via stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo within the inducing-variable formalism. By exploiting our proposed variational distribution, we provide a collapsed extension of our method where the inducing variables are marginalized analytically. We also showcase results when combining our framework with particle MCMC methods. We show that, on six real-world datasets, our approach can learn transition dynamics and latent states more accurately than competing methods.},

While the simplex method is known to have the finite termination property under mild assumptions, the number of iterations until optimality largely depends on the choice of initial basis. Existing strategies for selecting an advanced initial basis are mostly rule-based. These rules usually require extensive expert knowledge and empirical study to develop. Yet, many of them fail to exhibit consistent improvement, even for LP problems that arise in a single application scenario. In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach for initial basis selection. We employ graph neural networks as a building block and develop a model that attempts to capture the relationship between LP problems and their optimal bases. We leverage the fact that we often encounter sets of LP problems that exhibit considerable similarities, such as in scenarios like a manufacturer's daily production planning or an airport's hourly flight scheduling.},

The popular strategy involves generating input-output pairs with a PDE solver, training neural networks in a regression setting, and using the trained model as a cheap surrogate for the solver. However, the bottleneck is the number of expensive queries of a PDE solver needed to generate the dataset. We propose a computationally cheap augmentation strategy based on general covariance and simple random coordinate transformations. Our approach relies on the fact that physical laws are independent of the coordinate choice, so changing the coordinate system preserves the type of a parametric PDE and only changes PDE's data. For the neural networks and partial differential equations tested, our augmentation improved test error by 23\% on average. The worst observed result was a 17\% increase in test error for multilayer perceptron, while the best case showed an 80\% decrease for dilated residual network.},

We provide a surprising new analysis of the Fast JL transform, showing that the k ln^2 n term in the embedding time can be improved to (k ln^2 n)/α for an α = Ω(min{ε^{-1}ln(1/ε), ln n}). This is significant because despite the Fast JL transform being more than a decade old, it is one of the fastest dimensionality reduction techniques for many tradeoffs between ε, d and n.},

Unbiased estimation and recovery of true label ordering based on unlabeled data are challenging tasks and have attracted increasing attention in the recent literature. In this paper, we present a relatively complete analysis of label permutation problem for the generalized linear model with multivariate responses. The theory is established under different scenarios: with knowledge of true parameters, with partial knowledge of underlying label permutation matrix and without any knowledge. Our results remove the stringent conditions required by the current literature and are further extended to the missing observation setting which has never been considered in the field of label permutation problem. On the computational side, we propose two methods, maximum likelihood estimation algorithm and two-step estimation algorithm, to accommodate for different settings.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the impressive empirical success of policy gradient (PG) methods has catalyzed the development of their theoretical foundations. Despite the huge efforts directed at the design of efficient stochastic PG-type algorithms, the understanding of their convergence to a globally optimal policy is still limited. In this work, we develop improved global convergence guarantees for a general class of Fisher-non-degenerate parameterized policies which allows to address the case of continuous state action spaces. First, we propose a Normalized Policy Gradient method with Implicit Gradient Transport (N-PG-IGT) and derive a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2.5})$ sample complexity of this method for finding a global $\varepsilon$-optimal policy. Improving over the previously known $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ complexity, this algorithm does not require the use of importance sampling or second-order information and samples only one trajectory per iteration. Second, we further improve this complexity to $\tilde{\mathcal{\mathcal{O}}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ by considering a Hessian-Aided Recursive Policy Gradient ((N)-HARPG) algorithm enhanced with a correction based on a Hessian-vector product. Interestingly, both algorithms are (i) simple and easy to implement: single-loop, do not require large batches of trajectories and sample at most two trajectories per iteration; (ii) computationally and memory efficient: they do not require expensive subroutines at each iteration and can be implemented with memory linear in the dimension of parameters.},

To do so, we formalize the notion of a partially fitted policy evaluation method, which describes the use of target networks and bridges the gap between fitted methods and semigradient temporal difference algorithms. Using this framework we are able to uniquely characterise the so-called deadly triad - the use of TD updates with (nonlinear) function approximation and off-policy data - which often leads to nonconvergent algorithms.},

However, there exist two key challenges: low coverage samples and isotropic force fields, caused by molecular distributions assumed by existing denoising methods failing to capture the anisotropic characteristics of molecules. To tackle the challenges, we propose a novel hybrid noise strategy that includes noises on both dihedral angles and coordinates. The fractional denoising (Frad) framework decouples noise design from the constraints imposed by force learning equivalence, making the noise customizable and allowing for incorporating chemical priors to significantly improve molecular distribution modeling. Experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing state-of-the-art results across force prediction, quantum chemical properties, and binding affinity tasks, with refined noise design enhancing force accuracy and sampling coverage.},

  abstract     = {The authors present the Continuous Spatiotemporal Transformer (CST), a new transformer architecture designed for modeling continuous systems. The motivation stems from a fundamental limitation of standard transformers: they are discrete time and space models with no guarantees regarding continuous sampling when modeling continuous dynamical systems. The CST framework guarantees continuous and smooth output via optimization in Sobolev space. The authors benchmarked CST against traditional transformers and other spatiotemporal dynamics modeling methods, achieving superior performance on both synthetic and real systems, including learning brain dynamics. CST extends transformers to continuous data by adding Sobolev-based regularization that enforces smooth outputs, enabling accurate interpolation of irregular, noisy time-series.},

The authors propose a framework that employs saliency maps to obtain soft spatial attention masks that modulate the image features at different scales, referring to their method as Adversarial Counterfactual Attention (ACAT). ACAT increases the baseline classification accuracy of lesions in brain CT scans from 71.39% to 72.55% and of COVID-19 related findings in lung CT scans from 67.71% to 70.84% and exceeds the performance of competing methods. In the task of localising lesion location out of 6 possible regions, they obtain a score of 65.05% on brain CT scans, improving the score of 61.29% obtained with the best competing method.},

A fundamental question is whether there exist algorithms that, when run independently by all agents, lead to no-regret for each player, analogous to celebrated convergence results for no-regret learning in normal-form games. While recent work has shown that such algorithms exist for restricted settings (notably, when regret is defined with respect to deviations to Markov policies), the question of whether independent no-regret learning can be achieved in the standard Markov game framework was open. They provide a decisive negative resolution to this problem, both from a computational and statistical perspective. Under the complexity-theoretic assumption that PPAD ≠ P, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that attains no-regret in two-player general-sum Markov games when executed independently by all players. When the game is unknown, no algorithm can achieve no-regret without observing exponentially many episodes in the number of players.},

The authors propose to strongly bias gradient guesses in directions that are much more promising, such as feedback obtained from small, local auxiliary networks.

Various solutions exist but their impact on the convergence of the learning dynamics is not understood. Here, we elucidate the significant negative impact of data imbalance on learning, showing that the learning curves for minority and majority classes follow sub-optimal trajectories when training with a gradient-based optimizer. This slowdown is related to the imbalance ratio and can be traced back to a competition between the optimization of different classes. Our main contribution is the analysis of the convergence of full-batch (GD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and of variants that renormalize the contribution of each per-class gradient. We find that GD is not guaranteed to decrease the loss for each class but that this problem can be addressed by performing a per-class normalization of the gradient. With SGD, class imbalance has an additional effect on the direction of the gradients: the minority class suffers from a higher directional noise, which reduces the effectiveness of the per-class gradient normalization. Our findings not only allow us to understand the potential and limitations of strategies involving the per-class gradients, but also the reason for the effectiveness of previously used solutions for class imbalance such as oversampling.},

We show that such abilities can, in fact, be distilled down from {GPT}-3.5 (≥ 175B) to {T5} variants (≤ 11B). We propose model specialization, to specialize the model's ability towards a target task. The hypothesis is that large models (commonly viewed as larger than 100B) have strong modeling power such that they can perform a large spectrum of tasks. Small models (commonly viewed as smaller than 10B) have limited model capacity, but if we specialize their capacity towards a target task, the model can achieve decent performance improvements. We use multi-step math reasoning as our testbed because it is a very typical emergent ability. We show two important aspects of model abilities: (1) balancing language model's performance on multiple tasks is a delicate matter, as improvements on one task may compromise other tasks; (2) yet by intentionally paying the price of decreased generic ability, we can clearly improve across different model scales smaller than 10B towards a specialized multi-step math reasoning ability.},

  abstract     = {Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields ({GNeRF}) are one of the most promising real-world solutions for novel view synthesis, thanks to their cross-scene generalization capability and thus the possibility of instant rendering on new scenes. While adversarial robustness is essential for real-world applications, little study has been devoted to understanding its implication on {GNeRF}. We hypothesize that because {GNeRF} is implemented by conditioning on the source views from new scenes, which are often acquired from the Internet or third-party providers, there are potential new security concerns regarding its real-world applications. Meanwhile, existing understanding and solutions for neural networks' adversarial robustness may not be applicable to {GNeRF}, due to its 3D nature and uniquely diverse operations. To this end, we present {NeRFool}, which to the best of our knowledge is the first work that sets out to understand the adversarial robustness of {GNeRF}. Specifically, {NeRFool} unveils the vulnerability patterns and important insights regarding {GNeRF}'s adversarial robustness. Built upon the above insights gained from {NeRFool}, we further develop {NeRFool}+, which integrates two techniques capable of effectively attacking {GNeRF} across a wide range of target views, and provide guidelines for defending against our proposed attacks.},

The structure of RMs enables the decomposition of a task into simpler and independently solvable subtasks that help tackle long-horizon and/or sparse reward tasks. We propose a formalism for further abstracting the subtask structure by endowing an RM with the ability to call other RMs, thus composing a hierarchy of RMs (HRM). We exploit HRMs by treating each call to an RM as an independently solvable subtask using the options framework, and describe a curriculum-based method to learn HRMs from traces observed by the agent. Our experiments reveal that exploiting a handcrafted HRM leads to faster convergence than with a flat HRM, and that learning an HRM is feasible in cases where its equivalent flat representation is not.},

  abstract     = {Random masks define surprisingly effective sparse neural network models, as has been shown empirically. The resulting sparse networks can often compete with dense architectures and state-of-the-art lottery ticket pruning algorithms, even though they do not rely on computationally expensive prune-train iterations and can be drawn initially without significant computational overhead. We offer a theoretical explanation of how random masks can approximate arbitrary target networks if they are wider by a logarithmic factor in the inverse sparsity. This overparameterization factor is necessary at least for 3-layer random networks, which elucidates the observed degrading performance of random networks at higher sparsity. At moderate to high sparsity levels, however, our results imply that sparser networks are contained within random source networks so that any dense-to-sparse training scheme can be turned into a computationally more efficient sparse-to-sparse one by constraining the search to a fixed random mask. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in experiments for different pruning methods and propose particularly effective choices of initial layer-wise sparsity ratios of the random source network. As a special case, we show theoretically and experimentally that random source networks also contain strong lottery tickets.},

However, in most real-world scenarios, drawing domain knowledge from raw observations is complex and tedious. If the cell partitioning is not informative enough, Go-Explore can completely fail to explore the environment. The authors show that the Go-Explore approach can be generalized to any environment without domain knowledge and without cells by exploiting a learned latent representation. They introduce Latent Go-Explore (LGE), a simple and general approach based on the Go-Explore paradigm for exploration in reinforcement learning that can be flexibly combined with any strategy for learning a latent representation. The results show that LGE, although simpler than Go-Explore, is more robust and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of pure exploration on multiple hard-exploration environments including Montezuma's Revenge.},

We consider a different lower bound on the MI consisting of an entropy and a reconstruction term (ER), and analyze the main MVSSL families through its lens. Through this ER bound, we show that clustering-based methods such as DeepCluster and SwAV maximize the MI. We also re-interpret the mechanisms of distillation-based approaches such as BYOL and DINO, showing that they explicitly maximize the reconstruction term and implicitly encourage a stable entropy. We show that replacing the objectives of common MVSSL methods with this ER bound achieves competitive performance, while making all these methods stable when training with smaller batch sizes.},

However, traditional optimization-based approaches do not scale to large networks, and the design of good heuristics or approximation algorithms often requires significant manual trial-and-error. In this work, we argue that data-driven strategies can automate this process and learn efficient algorithms without compromising optimality. To do so, we present network control problems through the lens of reinforcement learning and propose a graph network-based framework to handle a broad class of problems. Instead of naively computing actions over high-dimensional graph elements, e.g., edges, we propose a bi-level formulation where we specify a desired next state via RL, and solve a convex program to best achieve it, leading to drastically improved scalability and performance.},

Some gain is expected as these models inherit the benefits of transfer learning, which is the standard motivation in non-private settings. However, the stark contrast in the gain of pretraining between non-private and private machine learning suggests that the gain in the latter is rooted in a fundamentally different cause. We hypothesize that the non-convex loss landscape of model training necessitates the optimization algorithm to go through two phases: selecting a good basin in the loss landscape, and solving an easy optimization within that basin. The former is harder to solve with private data, while the latter is harder to solve with public data due to distribution shift or data scarcity. We provide theoretical constructions that provably demonstrate this separation, and include systematic experiments on CIFAR10 and LibriSpeech that provide supporting evidence for our hypothesis.},

We first develop the positive definiteness of Gram matrices and prove that the gradient flow finds the global optima of the empirical loss under over-parameterization. Then, we demonstrate that the standard gradient descent converges to the global optima of the loss with proper choices of learning rates. The framework of our analysis works for various categories of PDEs (e.g., linear second-order PDEs) and common types of network initialization (LecunUniform etc.).},

Globe learns representations of local electronic structures that generalize across molecules via spatial message passing by connecting molecular orbitals to covalent bonds. Further, we propose a size-consistent wave function Ansatz, the Molecular orbital network (Moon), tailored to jointly solve Schr{\"o}dinger equations of different molecules.

However, conventional GR methods have two main limitations: they only focus on a single instruction relationship (generator-to-classifier) while ignoring ways the classifier can benefit the generator, and they typically reuse generated samples to update the generator, causing samples to deviate from previous task distributions. To overcome these issues, we propose DDGR, which adopts a diffusion model as the generator and calculates an instruction-operator through the classifier to instruct the generation of samples. Extensive experiments in class incremental (CI) and class incremental with repetition (CIR) settings demonstrate the advantages of DDGR.},

  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated an impressive ability to perform arithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks, when provided with a few examples at test time ("few-shot prompting"). Much of this success can be attributed to prompting methods such as "chain-of-thought", which employ LLMs for both understanding the problem description by decomposing it into steps, as well as solving each step of the problem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this sort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often make logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solution part, even when the problem is decomposed correctly. In this paper, we present Program-Aided Language models (PAL): a novel approach that uses the LLM to read natural language problems and generate programs as the intermediate reasoning steps, but offloads the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter. With PAL, decomposing the natural language problem into runnable steps remains the only learning task for the LLM, while solving is delegated to the interpreter. We demonstrate this synergy between a neural LLM and a symbolic interpreter across 13 mathematical, symbolic, and algorithmic reasoning tasks from BIG-Bench Hard and others. In all these natural language reasoning tasks, generating code using an LLM and reasoning using a Python interpreter leads to more accurate results than much larger models. For example, PAL using Codex achieves state-of-the-art few-shot accuracy on GSM8K, surpassing PaLM which uses chain-of-thought by absolute 15% top-1.},

Because the reward model is an imperfect proxy, optimizing its value too much can hinder ground truth performance, in accordance with Goodhart's law. This effect has been frequently observed, but not carefully measured due to the expense of collecting human preference data. We use a synthetic setup in which a fixed "gold-standard" reward model plays the role of humans, providing labels used to train a proxy reward model. We study how the gold reward model score changes as optimization occurs against the proxy reward model using either reinforcement learning or best-of-n sampling, finding that this relationship follows a different functional form depending on the method of optimization. For best-of-n sampling the functional form is quadratic, while for reinforcement learning it is logarithmic. The coefficients in these functions scale smoothly with the number of reward model parameters.},

  abstract     = {Long-tailed learning is one of the most challenging problems in visual recognition. Recent work proposes to learn the balanced representation by fixing the linear classifier as Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF), since they argue what matters in classification is the structure of the feature, instead of their directions. We hold a different view, showing that features with fixed directions may be harmful to model generalization, even if completely symmetric. To address this, we propose the Representation-Balanced Learning Framework (RBL), which introduces orthogonal matrices to learn directions while maintaining the geometric structure of ETF. This approach challenges the conventional view and demonstrates that feature directions matter significantly in long-tailed classification scenarios.},

We outperformed the best system on the WMT'21 English-Chinese news translation task using only five examples of English-Chinese parallel data at inference.

We assessed 13 popular domain adaptation methods, demonstrating more widespread failures under label proportion shifts than were previously known. We developed an effective two-step meta-algorithm that is compatible with most domain adaptation heuristics: (i) pseudo-balance the data at each epoch; and (ii) adjust the final classifier with target label distribution estimate. The meta-algorithm improves existing domain adaptation heuristics under large label proportion shifts, often by 2–10% accuracy points, while conferring minimal effect (<0.5%) when label proportions do not shift.},

RankMe allows assessment of performance on different downstream datasets without requiring any labels and has no training or hyperparameters to tune. Through thorough empirical experiments involving hundreds of training episodes, we demonstrate how RankMe can be used for hyperparameter selection with nearly no reduction in final performance compared to current selection methods that involve dataset labels.

While invariant methods are evaluated on large scale datasets, equivariant ones are evaluated in smaller, more controlled, settings. We aim at bridging the gap between the two in order to learn more diverse representations that are suitable for a wide range of tasks. We start by introducing a dataset called 3DIEBench, consisting of renderings from 3D models over 55 classes and more than 2.5 million images where we have full control on the transformations applied to the objects. We further introduce a predictor architecture based on hypernetworks to learn equivariant representations with no possible collapse to invariance. We introduce SIE (Split Invariant-Equivariant) which combines the hypernetwork-based predictor with representations split in two parts, one invariant, the other equivariant, to learn richer representations. We demonstrate significant performance gains over existing methods on equivariance related tasks from both a qualitative and quantitative point of view. We further analyze our introduced predictor and show how it steers the learned latent space. We hope that both our introduced dataset and approach will enable learning richer representations without supervision in more complex scenarios.},

We propose efficient algorithms based on local subsampling and invertible bloom look-up tables (IBLTs). We also show that our algorithms are information-theoretically optimal for a broad class of interactive schemes. The results show that the linear sketching constraint does increase the communication cost for both tasks by introducing an extra linear dependence on the number of users in a round. Moreover, our results also establish a separation between the communication cost for heavy hitter discovery and approximate histogram in the multi-round setting. The dependence on the number of rounds $R$ is at most logarithmic for heavy hitter discovery whereas that of approximate histogram is $\Theta(\sqrt{R})$. We also empirically demonstrate our findings.},

Most existing works focus on point-exposure studies where each subject only receives one treatment at a single time point. However, there are a number of applications (e.g., mobile health) where the treatments are sequentially assigned over time and the dynamic mediation effects are of primary interest. Proposing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, we are the first to evaluate dynamic mediation effects in settings with infinite horizons. We decompose the average treatment effect into an immediate direct effect, an immediate mediation effect, a delayed direct effect, and a delayed mediation effect. Upon the identification of each effect component, we further develop robust and semi-parametrically efficient estimators under the RL framework to infer these causal effects. The superior performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through extensive numerical studies, theoretical results, and an analysis of a mobile health dataset. A Python implementation of the proposed procedure is available at https://github.com/linlinlin97/MediationRL.},

While most in the community are asking how to push the limits of extreme computation, we ask the opposite question: How far can we get with a single GPU in just one day? We investigate the downstream performance achievable with a transformer-based language model trained completely from scratch with masked language modeling for a single day on a single consumer GPU. Aside from re-analyzing nearly all components of the pretraining pipeline for this scenario and providing a modified pipeline with performance close to BERT, we investigate why scaling down is hard, and which modifications actually improve performance in this scenario. We provide evidence that even in this constrained setting, performance closely follows scaling laws observed in large-compute settings. Through the lens of scaling laws, we categorize a range of recent improvements to training and architecture and discuss their merit and practical applicability (or lack thereof) for the limited compute setting.

In this work, we propose two direction- and structure-aware positional encodings for directed graphs: (1) the eigenvectors of the Magnetic Laplacian - a direction-aware generalization of the combinatorial Laplacian; (2) directional random walk encodings. Empirically, we show that the extra directionality information is useful in various downstream tasks, including correctness testing of sorting networks and source code understanding.},

Existing specifications for neural networks are in the paradigm of data as specification. That is, the local neighborhood centering around a reference input is considered to be correct (or robust). While existing specifications contribute to verifying adversarial robustness, a significant problem in many research domains, our empirical study shows that those verified regions are somewhat tight, and thus fail to allow verification of test set inputs, making them impractical for some real-world applications. To this end, we propose a new family of specifications called neural representation as specification. This form of specifications uses the intrinsic information of neural networks, specifically neural activation patterns (NAPs), rather than input data. We present a simple statistical approach to mining neural activation patterns. To show the effectiveness of discovered NAPs, we formally verify several important properties, such as various types of misclassifications will never happen for a given NAP, and there is no ambiguity between different NAPs.},

To mitigate the costs, we propose Guided Adversarial Training (GAT), a novel adversarial training technique that exploits auxiliary tasks under a limited set of training data. Our approach extends single-task models into multi-task models during the min-max optimization of adversarial training, and drives the loss optimization with a regularization of the gradient curvature across multiple tasks. GAT leverages two types of auxiliary tasks: self-supervised tasks, where the labels are generated automatically, and domain-knowledge tasks, where human experts provide additional labels. Experimentally, under limited data, GAT increases the robust accuracy on CIFAR-10 up to four times (from 11\% to 42\% robust accuracy) and the robust AUC of CheXpert medical imaging dataset from 50\% to 83\%. On the full CIFAR-10 dataset, GAT outperforms eight state-of-the-art adversarial training strategies. The large study across five datasets and six tasks demonstrates that task augmentation is an efficient alternative to data augmentation, and can be key to achieving both clean and robust performances.},

The convergence rates of this mechanism are similar to those in the prior work of Levy et al. (2021) and Narayanan et al. (2022), but with two important improvements. Our mechanism does not require any smoothness assumptions on the loss. Furthermore, our bounds are also the first where the minimum number of users needed for user-level privacy has no dependence on the dimension and only a logarithmic dependence on the desired excess error.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks often fail catastrophically by relying on spurious correlations. Most prior work assumes a clear dichotomy into spurious and reliable features; however, this is often unrealistic. For example, most of the time we do not want an autonomous car to simply copy the speed of surrounding cars -- we don't want our car to run a red light if a neighboring car does so. However, we cannot simply enforce invariance to next-lane speed, since it could provide valuable information about an unobservable pedestrian at a crosswalk. Thus, universally ignoring features that are sometimes (but not always) reliable can lead to non-robust performance. We formalize a new setting called contextual reliability which accounts for the fact that the "right" features to use may vary depending on the context. The paper proposes and analyzes a two-stage framework called Explicit Non-spurious feature Prediction (ENP) which first identifies the relevant features to use for a given context, then trains a model to rely exclusively on these features while being invariant to the rest.},

Perhaps surprisingly, we show that passive data, despite not having reward or action labels, can still be used to learn features that accelerate downstream RL. Our approach learns from passive data by modeling intentions: measuring how the likelihood of future outcomes change when the agent acts to achieve a particular task. We propose a temporal difference learning objective to learn about intentions, resulting in an algorithm similar to conventional RL, but which learns entirely from passive data. When optimizing this objective, our agent simultaneously learns representations of states, of policies, and of possible outcomes in an environment, all from raw observational data.},

Blackbox models are flexible but difficult to explain, while interpretable models are inherently explainable. Yet, interpretable models require extensive ML knowledge and tend to be less flexible and underperforming than their Blackbox variants. This paper aims to blur the distinction between a post hoc explanation of a Blackbox and constructing interpretable models. Beginning with a Blackbox, we iteratively carve out a mixture of interpretable experts (MoIE) and a residual network. Each interpretable model specializes in a subset of samples and explains them using First Order Logic (FOL), providing basic reasoning on concepts from the Blackbox. We route the remaining samples through a flexible residual. We repeat the method on the residual network until all the interpretable models explain the desired proportion of data. Our extensive experiments show that our route, interpret, and repeat approach (1) identifies a diverse set of instance-specific concepts with high concept completeness via MoIE without compromising in performance, (2) identifies the relatively "harder" samples to explain via residuals, (3) outperforms the interpretable by-design models by significant margins during test-time interventions, and (4) fixes the shortcut learned by the original Blackbox.},

This inductive bias leads to a phenomenon known as over-squashing, where a node feature is insensitive to information contained at distant nodes. Despite recent methods introduced to mitigate this issue, an understanding of the causes for over-squashing and of possible solutions are lacking. In this theoretical work, we prove that: (i) Neural network width can mitigate over-squashing, but at the cost of making the whole network more sensitive; (ii) Conversely, depth cannot help mitigate over-squashing: increasing the number of layers leads to over-squashing being dominated by vanishing gradients; (iii) The graph topology plays the greatest role, since over-squashing occurs between nodes at high commute time. Our analysis provides a unified framework to study different recent methods introduced to cope with over-squashing and serves as a justification for a class of methods that fall under graph rewiring.},

We give a weak learning assumption on H that ensures convergence to Bayes optimality without the need to make any realizability assumptions -- giving us an agnostic boosting algorithm for regression. We show that our weak learning assumption on H is both necessary and sufficient for multicalibration with respect to H to imply Bayes optimality, answering an open question. We also show that if H satisfies our weak learning condition relative to another class C then multicalibration with respect to H implies multicalibration with respect to C. Finally we investigate the empirical performance of our algorithm experimentally.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian inference usually requires running potentially costly inference procedures separately for every new observation. In contrast, the idea of amortized Bayesian inference is to initially invest computational cost in training an inference network on simulated data, which can subsequently be used to rapidly perform inference (i.e., to return estimates of posterior distributions) for new observations. This approach has been applied to many real-world models in the sciences and engineering, but it is unclear how robust the approach is to adversarial perturbations in the observed data. Here, we study the adversarial robustness of amortized Bayesian inference, focusing on simulation-based estimation of multi-dimensional posterior distributions. We show that almost unrecognizable, targeted perturbations of the observations can lead to drastic changes in the predicted posterior and highly unrealistic posterior predictive samples, across several benchmark tasks and a real-world example from neuroscience. We propose a computationally efficient regularization scheme based on penalizing the Fisher information of the conditional density estimator, and show how it improves the adversarial robustness of amortized Bayesian inference.},

In particular, we reconstruct a robot mask from the agent-centric latent and reconstruct the input image from the environment-centric latent. We supervise the input image encoder jointly with an RL loss, a robot mask reconstruction loss, and an image reconstruction loss.

  abstract     = {Aligning language models with preferences can be posed as approximating a target distribution representing some desired behavior. Existing approaches differ both in the functional form of the target distribution and the algorithm used to approximate it. For instance, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) corresponds to minimizing a reverse KL from an implicit target distribution arising from a KL penalty in the objective. On the other hand, Generative Distributional Control (GDC) has an explicit target distribution and minimizes a forward KL from it using the Distributional Policy Gradient (DPG) algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new approach, f-DPG, which allows the use of any f-divergence to approximate any target distribution that can be evaluated. f-DPG unifies both frameworks (RLHF, GDC) and the approximation methods (DPG, RL with KL penalties). We show the practical benefits of various choices of divergence objectives and demonstrate that there is no universally optimal objective but that different divergences present different alignment and diversity trade-offs. We show that Jensen-Shannon divergence strikes a good balance between these objectives, and frequently outperforms forward KL divergence by a wide margin, leading to significant improvements over prior work.},

Specific extensions of the popular concept of breakdown point, tailored to consensus ranking, are proposed and the related computational issues are addressed.

Compared to the special case when $K=2$, we need to learn unknown distributions instead of values. We develop an online shadow tomography procedure that solves this problem with high success probability requiring $\tilde{O}(K \log^2 M \log d / \varepsilon^4)$ copies of $\rho$. We also provide an information-theoretic lower bound showing that at least $\Omega(\min\{d^2, K + \log M\} / \varepsilon^2)$ copies of $\rho$ are required to solve this problem with high success probability. Our sample complexity has only logarithmic dependence on M and d and is sample-optimal concerning the dependence on K.},

This algorithm relies on a sequence of interpolating distributions bridging the target to an initial tractable distribution such as the well-known geometric mean path of unnormalized distributions which is assumed to be suboptimal in general. In this work, we prove that the geometric annealing corresponds to the distribution path that minimizes the KL divergence between the current particle distribution and the desired target when the feasible change in the particle distribution is constrained. Following this observation, we derive the constant rate discretization schedule for this annealing sequence, which adjusts the schedule to the difficulty of moving samples between the initial and the target distributions. We extend our results to f-divergences and present the respective dynamics of annealing sequences based on which we propose the Constant Rate AIS (CR-AIS) algorithm and its efficient implementation for $\alpha$-divergences. We empirically show that CR-AIS performs well on multiple benchmark distributions while avoiding the computationally expensive tuning loop in existing Adaptive AIS.},

  abstract     = {When trying to solve a computational problem, we are often faced with a choice between algorithms that are guaranteed to return the right answer but differ in their runtime distributions (e.g., SAT solvers, sorting algorithms). This paper aims to lay theoretical foundations for such choices by formalizing preferences over runtime distributions. It might seem that we should simply prefer the algorithm that minimizes expected runtime. However, such preferences would be driven by exactly how slow our algorithm is on bad inputs, whereas in practice we are typically willing to cut off occasional, sufficiently long runs before they finish. We propose a principled alternative, taking a utility-theoretic approach to characterize the scoring functions that describe preferences over algorithms. These functions depend on the way our value for solving our problem decreases with time and on the distribution from which captimes are drawn. We also study what happens when we must choose a single algorithm to use for solving each instance in a set of instances drawn from different, known distributions.},

TPCC synthesizes desirable features from spectral clustering and topological data analysis and is based on considering the spectral properties of a simplicial complex associated to the considered point cloud. As it is based on considering sparse eigenvector computations, TPCC is similarly easy to interpret and implement as spectral clustering. However, by focusing not just on a single matrix associated to a graph created from the point cloud data, but on a whole set of Hodge Laplacians associated to an appropriately constructed simplicial complex, the method can leverage a far richer set of topological features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TPCC on both synthetic and real-world data, and show that it outperforms classical spectral clustering and other topological clustering methods in many scenarios.},

With the learnware paradigm, model developers can spontaneously submit models to the market without leaking data privacy, and users can leverage models in the market to accomplish different machine learning tasks without having to build models from scratch. Recent studies have attempted to realize the model specification through Reduced Kernel Mean Embedding (RKME). In this paper, we make an attempt to improve the effectiveness of RKME specification for heterogeneous label spaces, where the learnware market does not contain a model that has the same label space as the user's task, by considering a class-specific model specification explicitly, along with a class-wise learnware identification method. Both theoretical and empirical analyses show that our proposal can quickly and accurately find useful learnwares that satisfy users' requirements. Moreover, we find that for a specific task, reusing a small model identified via the specification performs better than directly reusing a pre-trained generic big model.},

Prior work has achieved a good trade-off by designing a privacy-aware compression mechanism, called the minimum variance unbiased (MVU) mechanism, that numerically solves an optimization problem to determine the parameters of the mechanism. This paper builds upon it by introducing a new interpolation procedure in the numerical design process that allows for a far more efficient privacy analysis. The result is the new Interpolated MVU mechanism that is more scalable, has a better privacy-utility trade-off, and provides SOTA results on communication-efficient federated learning.},

A proven strategy is to explore those invariant relationships between input and target variables, working equally well for non-participating clients. However, learning invariant relationships is often in an explicit manner from data, representation, and distribution, which violates the federated principles of privacy-preserving and limited communication. In this paper, we propose FedIIR, which implicitly learns invariant relationships from parameter for out-of-distribution generalization, adhering to the above principles. Specifically, we utilize the prediction disagreement to quantify invariant relationships and implicitly reduce it through inter-client gradient alignment. Theoretically, we demonstrate the range of non-participating clients to which FedIIR is expected to generalize and present the convergence results for FedIIR in the massively distributed with limited communication. Extensive experiments show that FedIIR significantly outperforms relevant baselines in terms of out-of-distribution generalization of federated learning.},

For a learning algorithm satisfying (α, ε)-Renyi DP, we utilize different variants of the celebrated Fano's inequality to upper bound the attack advantage of a data reconstruction adversary. Our bound can be numerically computed to relate the parameter ε to the desired level of privacy protection in practice, and complements the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of DP against data reconstruction attacks even at relatively large values of ε.},

Despite their effectiveness, the high latency brought by non-trivial neighborhood data dependency limits GNNs in practical deployments. Conversely, the known efficient MLPs are much less effective than GNNs due to the lack of relational knowledge. In this work, to combine the advantages of GNNs and MLPs, we start with exploring direct knowledge distillation (KD) methods for link prediction, i.e., predicted logit-based matching and node representation-based matching. Upon observing direct KD analogs do not perform well for link prediction, we propose a relational KD framework, Linkless Link Prediction (LLP), to distill knowledge for link prediction with MLPs. Unlike simple KD methods that match independent link logits or node representations, LLP distills relational knowledge that is centered around each (anchor) node to the student MLP. Specifically, we propose rank-based matching and distribution-based matching strategies that complement each other. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP boosts the link prediction performance of MLPs with significant margins and even outperforms the teacher GNNs on 7 out of 8 benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {The prediction of molecular properties is a crucial task in the field of material and drug discovery. The potential benefits of using deep learning techniques are reflected in the wealth of recent literature. Still, these techniques are faced with a common challenge in practice: Labeled data are limited by the cost of manual extraction from literature and laborious experimentation. In this work, we propose a data-efficient property predictor by utilizing a learnable hierarchical molecular grammar that can generate molecules from grammar production rules. Such a grammar induces an explicit geometry of the space of molecular graphs, which provides an informative prior on molecular structural similarity. The property prediction is performed using graph neural diffusion over the grammar-induced geometry.},

  abstract     = {Polynomial filters, a kind of Graph Neural Networks, typically use a predetermined polynomial basis and learn the coefficients from the training data. It has been observed that the effectiveness of the model is highly dependent on the property of the polynomial basis. Consequently, two natural and fundamental questions arise: Can we learn a suitable polynomial basis from the training data? Can we determine the optimal polynomial basis for a given graph and node features? In this paper, we propose two spectral GNN models that provide positive answers to the questions posed above. First, inspired by Favard's Theorem, we propose the FavardGNN model, which learns a polynomial basis from the space of all possible orthonormal bases.},

LongCoder employs a sliding window mechanism for self-attention and introduces two types of globally accessible tokens - bridge tokens and memory tokens - to improve performance and efficiency. Bridge tokens are inserted throughout the input sequence to aggregate local information and facilitate global interaction, while memory tokens are included to highlight important statements that may be invoked later and need to be memorized, such as package imports and definitions of classes, functions, or structures. We conduct experiments on a newly constructed dataset that contains longer code context and the publicly available CodeXGLUE benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that LongCoder achieves superior performance on code completion tasks compared to previous models while maintaining comparable efficiency in terms of computational resources during inference.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs), in general, are built on the assumption of a static set of features characterizing each node in a graph. This assumption is often violated in practice. Existing methods partly address this issue through feature imputation. However, these techniques (i) assume uniformity of feature set across nodes, (ii) are transductive by nature, and (iii) fail to work when features are added or removed over time. In this work, we address these limitations through a novel GNN framework called GRAFENNE. GRAFENNE performs a novel allotropic transformation on the original graph, wherein the nodes and features are decoupled through a bipartite encoding. Through a carefully chosen message passing framework on the allotropic transformation, we make the model parameter size independent of the number of features and thereby inductive to both unseen nodes and features. We prove that GRAFENNE is at least as expressive as any of the existing message-passing GNNs in terms of Weisfeiler-Leman tests, and therefore, the additional inductivity to unseen features does not come at the cost of expressivity. In addition, as demonstrated over four real-world graphs, GRAFENNE empowers the underlying GNN with high empirical efficacy and the ability to learn in continual fashion over streaming feature sets.},

Theoretically, our resulting {OPS}+calibeating method is guaranteed to be calibrated for adversarial outcome sequences. Empirically, it is effective on a range of synthetic and real-world datasets, with and without distribution drifts, achieving superior performance without hyperparameter tuning.

Fully achieving this potential is hindered by manually designed architectures that remain static throughout training. On the contrary, learning in the brain occurs through structural changes that are in tandem with changes in synaptic strength. Thus, we propose Multi-Task Structural Learning ({MTSL}) that simultaneously learns the multi-task architecture and its parameters. {MTSL} begins with an identical single-task network for each task and alternates between a task-learning phase and a structural-learning phase. In the task learning phase, each network specializes in the corresponding task. In each of the structural learning phases, starting from the earliest layer, locally similar task layers first transfer their knowledge to a newly created group layer before being removed. {MTSL} then uses the group layer in place of the corresponding removed task layers and moves on to the next layers. Our empirical results show that {MTSL} achieves competitive generalization with various baselines and improves robustness to out-of-distribution data.},

The former suffer from mode collapse or memorization issues, limiting their application to scientific data. The latter require restrictive assumptions such as log-concavity to escape the curse of dimensionality. We partially bridge this gap by introducing conditionally strongly log-concave ({CSLC}) models, which factorize the data distribution into a product of conditional probability distributions that are strongly log-concave. This factorization is obtained with orthogonal projectors adapted to the data distribution. It leads to efficient parameter estimation and sampling algorithms, with theoretical guarantees, although the data distribution is not globally log-concave. We show that several challenging multiscale processes are conditionally log-concave using wavelet packet orthogonal projectors. Numerical results are shown for physical fields such as the $\varphi^4$ model and weak lensing convergence maps with higher resolution than in previous works.},

This can be largely attributed to message passing only occurring locally, over a node's immediate neighbours. Rewiring approaches attempting to make graphs `more connected', and supposedly better suited to long-range tasks, often lose the inductive bias provided by distance on the graph since they make distant nodes communicate instantly at every layer. In this paper we propose a framework, applicable to any {MPNN} architecture, that performs a layer-dependent rewiring to ensure gradual densification of the graph. We also propose a delay mechanism that permits skip connections between nodes depending on the layer and their mutual distance. We validate our approach on several long-range tasks and show that it outperforms graph Transformers and multi-hop {MPNNs}.},

Here, we address both problems by employing a deep reinforcement learning model to optimize the social learning strategies ({SLSs}) of agents in a cooperative game in a multi-dimensional landscape. Throughout the training for maximizing the overall payoff, we find that the agent spontaneously learns various concepts of social learning, such as copying, focusing on frequent and well-performing neighbors, self-comparison, and the importance of balancing between individual and social learning, without any explicit guidance or prior knowledge about the system. The {SLS} from a fully trained agent outperforms all of the traditional, baseline {SLSs} in terms of mean payoff. We demonstrate the superior performance of the reinforcement learning agent in various environments, including temporally changing environments and real social networks, which also verifies the adaptability of our framework to different social settings.},

A classical algorithm for {DC} problems is called the {DC} algorithm ({DCA}).

We extend existing convergence properties of {DCA}, and connect them to convergence properties on the {DS} problem. Our results on {DCA} match the theoretical guarantees satisfied by existing {DS} algorithms, while providing a more complete characterization of convergence properties.

We propose a measure called Stability to quantify the robustness of counterfactuals to potential model changes for differentiable models, e.g., neural networks. Our main contribution shows that counterfactuals with sufficiently high value of Stability will remain valid after potential naturally-occurring model changes with high probability, leveraging concentration bounds for Lipschitz function of independent Gaussians. Since our quantification depends on the local Lipschitz constant around a data point which is not always available, we examine practical relaxations of our proposed measure and demonstrate experimentally how they can be incorporated to find robust counterfactuals.},

The class-wise distribution of angular representation becomes a sum of these kernels. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the wrapped Cauchy distribution excels the Gaussian distribution in approximating mixed distributions. Additionally, WCDAS uses trainable concentration parameters to dynamically adjust the compactness and margin of each class. Empirical results confirm label-aware behavior in these parameters and demonstrate WCDAS's superiority over other state-of-the-art softmax-based methods in handling long-tailed visual recognition across multiple benchmark datasets.},

We attributed the improvement in interpretability to the class-similarity information transferred from the teacher to student models. First, we confirmed the transfer of class-similarity information from the teacher to student model via logit distillation. Then, we analyzed how class-similarity information affects model interpretability in terms of its presence or absence and degree of similarity information. We conducted various quantitative and qualitative experiments and examined the results on different datasets, different knowledge distillation methods, and according to different measures of interpretability. Our research showed that knowledge distillation models by large models could be used more reliably in various fields.},

A key question is how much this system identification approach tells us about brain computation. Does it validate one model architecture over another? The authors evaluate the most commonly used comparison techniques, such as a linear encoding model and centered kernel alignment, to correctly identify a model by replacing brain recordings with known ground truth models. System identification performance is quite variable; it also depends significantly on factors independent of the ground truth architecture, such as stimuli images. The performance of commonly used identification techniques such as neural regression and centered kernel alignment at system identification is quite variable and depends significantly on factors independent of the ground truth architecture, such as scoring function and dataset. The paper shows the limitations of using functional similarity scores in identifying higher-level architectural motifs.},

However, the SC relaxation is loose and, while it offers a closed-form solution, it also yields overly smooth cluster assignments that poorly separate the vertices. In this paper, we propose a GNN model that computes cluster assignments by optimizing a tighter relaxation of the minimum cut based on graph total variation (GTV). The cluster assignments can be used directly to perform vertex clustering or to implement graph pooling in a graph classification framework.},

Much of this work has focused on relatively ``easy'' PDE operators (e.g., elliptic and parabolic), with less emphasis on relatively ``hard'' PDE operators (e.g., hyperbolic). Within numerical PDEs, the latter problem class requires control of a type of volume element or conservation constraint, which is known to be challenging. Delivering on the promise of SciML requires seamlessly incorporating both types of problems into the learning process. To address this issue, we propose ProbConserv, a framework for incorporating conservation constraints into a generic SciML architecture. To do so, ProbConserv combines the integral form of a conservation law with a Bayesian update.},

The demonstration data is generated by an expert with a given competence level, a notion we introduce.

By designing a novel heterogeneous normalized attention layer, our model is highly flexible to handle multiple input functions and irregular meshes. Besides, we introduce a geometric gating mechanism which could be viewed as a soft domain decomposition to solve the multi-scale problems. The large model capacity of the transformer architecture grants our model the possibility to scale to large datasets and practical problems. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets from different domains and achieve a remarkable improvement compared with alternative methods.},

We investigate the consequences of this model in three fundamental learning-theoretic settings: nonparametric optimal learning, parametric risk minimization, and gradient-based optimization. In each setting, we come up with coordinated algorithmic strategies and characterize natural success criteria as a function of the collective's size. Complementing our theory, we conduct systematic experiments on a skill classification task involving tens of thousands of resumes from a gig platform for freelancers. Through more than two thousand model training runs of a BERT-like language model, we see a striking correspondence emerge between our empirical observations and the predictions made by our theory. Taken together, our theory and experiments broadly support the conclusion that algorithmic collectives of exceedingly small fractional size can exert significant control over a platform's learning algorithm.},

Given any system of linear PDEs with constant coefficients, we propose a family of Gaussian process (GP) priors, which we call EPGP, such that all realizations are exact solutions of this system. We apply the Ehrenpreis-Palamodov fundamental principle, which works as a non-linear Fourier transform, to construct GP kernels mirroring standard spectral methods for GPs. Our approach can infer probable solutions of linear PDE systems from any data such as noisy measurements, or pointwise defined initial and boundary conditions. Constructing EPGP-priors is algorithmic, generally applicable, and comes with a sparse version (S-EPGP) that learns the relevant spectral frequencies and works better for big data sets. We demonstrate our approach on three families of systems of PDEs, the heat equation, wave equation, and Maxwell's equations, where we improve upon the state of the art in computation time and precision, in some experiments by several orders of magnitude.}

Most ensembling methods for black-box base learners fall under the umbrella of 'stacked generalization,' namely training an ML algorithm that takes the inferences from the base learners as input. While stacking has been widely applied in practice, its theoretical properties are poorly understood. In this paper, we prove a novel result, showing that choosing the best stacked generalization from a (finite or finite-dimensional) family of stacked generalizations based on cross-validated performance does not perform 'much worse' than the oracle best. Our result strengthens and significantly extends the results in Van der Laan et al. (2007). Inspired by the theoretical analysis, we further propose a particular family of stacked generalizations in the context of probabilistic forecasting, each one with a different sensitivity for how much the ensemble weights are allowed to vary across items, timestamps in the forecast horizon, and quantiles. Experimental results demonstrate the performance gain of the proposed method.}

Recognizing the lack of knowledge on the underlying causal mechanism and the possibility of infinitely many such mechanisms, we optimize over this space and compute upper and lower bounds on the counterfactual quantity of interest. Our work brings together ideas from causality, state-space models, simulation, and optimization, and we apply it on a breast cancer case study.

Standard GNNs define a local message-passing mechanism which propagates information over the whole graph domain by stacking multiple layers. This paradigm suffers from two major limitations, over-squashing and poor long-range dependencies, that can be solved using global attention but significantly increases the computational cost to quadratic complexity. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to overcome these structural limitations by leveraging the {ViT}/{MLP}-Mixer architectures introduced in computer vision. We introduce a new class of GNNs, called Graph {ViT}/{MLP}-Mixer, that holds three key properties. First, they capture long-range dependency and mitigate the issue of over-squashing as demonstrated on Long Range Graph Benchmark and TreeNeighbourMatch datasets. Second, they offer better speed and memory efficiency with a complexity linear to the number of nodes and edges, surpassing the related Graph Transformer and expressive GNN models. Third, they show high expressivity in terms of graph isomorphism as they can distinguish at least 3-WL non-isomorphic graphs. We test our architecture on 4 simulated datasets and 7 real-world benchmarks, and show highly competitive results on all of them.}

This leads to feature shifts in the time and frequency representations. Additionally, the label distributions of tasks in the source and target domains can differ significantly, posing difficulties in addressing label shifts and recognizing labels unique to the target domain. Effectively transferring complex time series models remains a formidable problem. We present {RAINCOAT}, the first model for both closed-set and universal domain adaptation on complex time series. {RAINCOAT} addresses feature and label shifts by considering both temporal and frequency features, aligning them across domains, and correcting for misalignments to facilitate the detection of private labels. Additionally, {RAINCOAT} improves transferability by identifying label shifts in target domains.}

Because sketches may be merged to summarize multiset unions, they are a basic building block in data warehouses. Although many practical sketches for cardinality estimation exist, none provide privacy when merging. We propose the first practical cardinality sketches that are simultaneously mergeable, differentially private ({DP}), and have low empirical errors. These introduce a novel randomized algorithm for performing logical operations on noisy bits, a tight privacy analysis, and provably optimal estimation. Our sketches dramatically outperform existing theoretical solutions in simulations and on real-world data.},

  abstract     = {Exploration in environments which differ across episodes has received increasing attention in recent years. Current methods use some combination of global novelty bonuses, computed using the agent's entire training experience, and episodic novelty bonuses, computed using only experience from the current episode. However, the use of these two types of bonuses has been ad-hoc and poorly understood. In this work, we shed light on the behavior of these two types of bonuses through controlled experiments on easily interpretable tasks as well as challenging pixel-based settings. We find that the two types of bonuses succeed in different settings, with episodic bonuses being most effective when there is little shared structure across episodes and global bonuses being effective when more structure is shared. We develop a conceptual framework which makes this notion of shared structure precise by considering the variance of the value function across contexts, and which provides a unifying explanation of our empirical results. We furthermore find that combining the two bonuses can lead to more robust performance across different degrees of shared structure, and investigate different algorithmic choices for defining and combining global and episodic bonuses based on function approximation. This results in an algorithm which sets a new state of the art across 16 tasks from the {M}ini{H}ack suite used in prior work, and also performs robustly on {H}abitat and {M}ontezuma's {R}evenge.},

We propose a joint optimization algorithm to calibrate the camera pose and learn a geometric representation using efficient multi-resolution hash encoding. Showing that the oscillating gradient flows of hash encoding interfere with the registration of camera poses, our method addresses the issue by utilizing smooth interpolation weighting to stabilize the gradient oscillation for the ray samplings across hash grids.},

  abstract     = {Chaotic dynamical systems ({DS}) are ubiquitous in nature and society. Often we are interested in reconstructing such systems from observed time series for prediction or mechanistic insight, where by reconstruction we mean learning geometrical and invariant temporal properties of the system in question (like attractors). However, training reconstruction algorithms like recurrent neural networks ({RNN}s) on such systems by gradient-descent based techniques faces severe challenges. This is mainly due to exploding gradients caused by the exponential divergence of trajectories in chaotic systems. Moreover, for (scientific) interpretability we wish to have as low dimensional reconstructions as possible, preferably in a model which is mathematically tractable. Here we report that a surprisingly simple modification of teacher forcing leads to provably strictly all-time bounded gradients in training on chaotic systems, and, when paired with a simple architectural rearrangement of a tractable {RNN} design, piecewise-linear {RNN}s ({PLRNN}s), allows for faithful reconstruction in spaces of at most the dimensionality of the observed system. We show on several {DS} that with these amendments we can reconstruct {DS} better than current {SOTA} algorithms, in much lower dimensions. Performance differences were particularly compelling on real world data with which most other methods severely struggled. This work thus led to a simple yet powerful {DS} reconstruction algorithm which is highly interpretable at the same time.},

Therefore, the current methods are not applicable if the treatment policy is unknown or a counterfactual analysis is needed. To handle these limitations, we model the treatments and outcomes jointly in continuous time, by combining {G}aussian processes and point processes.},

One prominent issue is the curse of dimensionality: it is commonly believed that the marginal likelihood should be reminiscent of cross-validation metrics and both should deteriorate with larger input dimensions. However, we prove that by tuning hyperparameters to maximize marginal likelihood (the empirical Bayes procedure), performance, as measured by the marginal likelihood, improves monotonically with the input dimension. On the other hand, cross-validation metrics exhibit qualitatively different behavior that is characteristic of double descent. Cold posteriors, which have recently attracted interest due to their improved performance in certain settings, appear to exacerbate these phenomena.},

We introduce an online learning algorithm whose total cost after {$T$} rounds exceeds that of a predictor which knows the productivity of all experts in advance by at most {$\mathcal{O}(K^2(\log T)\sqrt{T})$} where {$K$} is the number of experts. In order to achieve this result, we combine Lipschitz bandits and online classification with surrogate losses. These tools allow us to improve upon the bound of order {$T^{2/3}$} one would obtain in the standard Lipschitz bandit setting. Our algorithm is empirically evaluated on synthetic data.},

However, on traditional digital chips these algorithms suffer from having to solve a costly inference problem twice, making these approaches more than two orders of magnitude slower than back-propagation. In the analog realm equilibrium propagation may be promising for fast and energy efficient learning, but states still need to be inferred and stored twice. Inspired by lifted neural networks and compartmental neuron models we propose a simple energy based compartmental neuron model, termed dual propagation, in which each neuron is a dyad with two intrinsic states. At inference time these intrinsic states encode the error/activity duality through their difference and their mean respectively. The advantage of this method is that only a single inference phase is needed and that inference can be solved in layerwise closed-form. Experimentally we show on common computer vision datasets, including {I}magenet32x32, that dual propagation performs equivalently to back-propagation both in terms of accuracy and runtime.},

This class of problems appears widely in a variety of applications in machine learning and engineering, ranging from constrained deep neural networks, to optimal control, to {PDE}-constrained optimization. We develop an adaptive inexact {N}ewton method for this problem class. In each iteration, we solve the {L}agrangian {N}ewton system inexactly via a randomized iterative sketching solver, and select a suitable stepsize by performing line search on an exact augmented {L}agrangian merit function. The randomized solvers have advantages over deterministic linear system solvers by significantly reducing per-iteration flops complexity and storage cost, when equipped with suitable sketching matrices. Our method adaptively controls the accuracy of the randomized solver and the penalty parameters of the exact augmented {L}agrangian, to ensure that the inexact {N}ewton direction is a descent direction of the exact augmented {L}agrangian. This allows us to establish a global almost sure convergence. We also show that a unit stepsize is admissible locally, so that our method exhibits a local linear convergence. Furthermore, we prove that the linear convergence can be strengthened to superlinear convergence if we gradually sharpen the adaptive accuracy condition on the randomized solver.

  abstract     = {Currently, applying diffusion models in pixel space of high resolution images is difficult. Instead, existing approaches focus on diffusion in lower dimensional spaces (latent diffusion), or have multiple super-resolution levels of generation referred to as cascades. The downside is that these approaches add additional complexity to the diffusion framework. This paper aims to improve denoising diffusion for high resolution images while keeping the model as simple as possible. The research question is: How can one train a standard denoising diffusion models on high resolution images, and still obtain performance comparable to these alternate approaches? The four main findings are: (1) the noise schedule should be adjusted for high resolution images, (2) it is sufficient to scale only a particular part of the architecture, (3) dropout should be added at specific locations in the architecture, and (4) downsampling is an effective strategy to avoid high resolution feature maps. By combining these simple yet effective techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art image generation among diffusion models without sampling modifiers on {ImageNet}.},

The goal in strategic classification is therefore to train predictive models that are robust to such behavior. However, the conventional framework assumes that changing features does not change actual outcomes, which depicts users as 'gaming' the system. Here we remove this assumption, and study learning in a causal strategic setting where true outcomes do change. Focusing on accuracy as our primary objective, we show how strategic behavior and causal effects underlie two complementing forms of distribution shift. We characterize these shifts, and propose a learning algorithm that balances between these two forces and over time, and permits end-to-end training. Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic data demonstrate the utility of our approach.},

In some cases, these {AI} systems can be unfair by exhibiting bias or discrimination against certain social groups, which can have severe consequences in real life. To address this issue, inspired by one of the most well-known human learning skills called grouping, we propose a novel {ML} framework where the {ML} model learns to group a diverse set of problems into distinct subgroups to solve each subgroup using its specific sub-model. Through this approach, we can minimize the fairness-accuracy tradeoff and achieve both fair and accurate decision-making. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and show that our method outperforms baseline methods in terms of both fairness and accuracy.},

This form of ``black-box'' classifier training has become increasingly important as the cost of training and inference in large-scale {LM}s grows. But existing black-box {LM} classifier learning approaches are themselves computationally inefficient, typically specializing {LM}s to the target task by searching in a large space of (discrete or continuous) prompts using zeroth-order optimization methods. Instead of directly optimizing in prompt space, {PromptBoosting} obtains a small pool of prompts via a gradient-free approach and then constructs a large pool of weak learners by pairing these prompts with different elements of the {LM}'s output distribution. These weak learners are then ensembled using the {AdaBoost} algorithm. The entire learning process requires only a small number of forward passes and no backward pass. Experiments show that {PromptBoosting} achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple black-box few-shot classification tasks, and matches or outperforms full fine-tuning in both few-shot and standard learning paradigms, while training 10x faster than existing black-box methods.},

Further, in practice, data is available in the form of trajectories, introducing correlation between samples. In this work, we present a method for sparse learning of transfer operators from $\beta$-mixing stochastic processes, in both discrete and continuous time, and provide sample complexity analysis extending existing theoretical guarantees for learning from non-sparse, i.i.d. data. In addressing continuous-time settings, we develop precise descriptions using covariance-type operators for the infinitesimal generator that aids in the sample complexity analysis. We empirically illustrate the efficacy of our sparse embedding approach through deterministic and stochastic nonlinear system examples.},

In this problem, the agent is given the option to select a subset of size at most $K$ from a set of $L$ ground items. Each item is associated to a certain mean reward as well as a variance that represents its risk. To mitigate the risk that the agent incurs, we require that with probability at least $1-\delta$, over the entire horizon of time $T$, each of the choices that the agent makes should contain items whose sum of variances does not exceed a certain variance budget. We call this probably anytime-safe constraint. Under this constraint, we design and analyze an algorithm {PASCombUCB} that minimizes the regret over the horizon of time $T$. The paper also develops information-theoretic lower bounds to show the algorithm's performance under both problem-dependent and problem-independent paradigms.},

  abstract     = {Underlying data structures, such as symmetries or invariances to transformations, are often exploited to improve the solution of learning tasks. However, embedding these properties in models or learning algorithms can be challenging and computationally intensive. Data augmentation, on the other hand, induces these symmetries during training by applying multiple transformations to the input data. Despite its ubiquity, its effectiveness depends on the choices of which transformations to apply, when to do so, and how often. In fact, there is both empirical and theoretical evidence that the indiscriminate use of data augmentation can introduce biases that outweigh its benefits. This work tackles these issues by automatically adapting the data augmentation while solving the learning task. To do so, it formulates data augmentation as an invariance-constrained learning problem and leverages Monte Carlo Markov Chain ({MCMC}) sampling to solve it. The result is a practical algorithm that not only does away with a priori searches for augmentation distributions, but also dynamically controls if and when data augmentation is applied. Our experiments illustrate the performance of this method, which achieves state-of-the-art results in automatic data augmentation benchmarks for {CIFAR} datasets. Furthermore, this approach can be used to gather insights on the actual symmetries underlying a learning task.},

We improve the existing decreasing speed of Lyapunov function from $\mathcal{O}(p^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(p)$, when $p$, the frequency of the proximal operators is small enough. Our theoretical analysis also reveals the drawbacks of using large step sizes for gradient descent in {ProxSkip} when the proximal operator part is the bottleneck. Our main motivation comes from the continuous limit in which the original analysis of {ProxSkip} fails to guarantee convergence when both the step size $\gamma$ and frequency $p$ tend to zero. We construct a counterexample to demonstrate why such counterintuitive behavior occurs for the original analysis and then propose a novel Lyapunov function variant to construct a tighter analysis, avoiding the problem of the old one. Such a new Lyapunov function can be directly extended to many other variants of {ProxSkip}. When applied to stochastic gradient setup, our analysis leads to an improved proximal operator complexity for {SProxSkip} from $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{1}{\varepsilon\mu^2}}\log(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}))$ to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\kappa}\log(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}))$.},

A key tradeoff in modeling the posteriors over latents is between expressivity and tractable optimization. For algorithms based on expectation-maximization ({EM}), the E-step is often intractable without restrictive approximations to the posterior. We propose the use of {GFlowNets}, algorithms for sampling from an unnormalized density by learning a stochastic policy for sequential construction of samples, for this intractable E-step. By training {GFlowNets} to sample from the posterior over latents, we take advantage of their strengths as amortized variational inference algorithms for complex distributions over discrete structures. Our approach, {GFlowNet-EM}, enables the training of expressive {LVM}s with discrete compositional latents, as shown by experiments on non-context-free grammar induction and on images using discrete variational autoencoders ({VAE}s) without conditional independence enforced in the encoder.},

Rather than learning a predictor based on a known loss function, omnipredictors can easily be post-processed to minimize any one of a rich family of loss functions compared with the loss of hypotheses in a class $\mathcal{C}$. It has been shown that such omnipredictors exist and are implied (for all convex and Lipschitz loss functions) by the notion of multicalibration from the algorithmic fairness literature. In this paper, we introduce omnipredictors for constrained optimization and study their complexity and implications. The notion that we introduce allows the learner to be unaware of the loss function that will be later assigned \emph{as well as the constraints that will be later imposed}, as long as the subpopulations that are used to define these constraints are known. We show how to obtain omnipredictors for constrained optimization problems, relying on appropriate variants of multicalibration. We also investigate the implications of this notion when the constraints used are so-called group fairness notions.},

The study reveals that the effectiveness of pre-training depends on the downstream policy learning algorithm, with conventional RL-based evaluations being highly variable and unreliable.

In this paper, the authors attempt to understand this question of accuracy disparity by taking a closer look at linear classifiers under a Gaussian mixture model. They decompose the impact of adversarial robustness into two parts: an inherent effect that will degrade the standard accuracy on all classes due to the robustness constraint, and the other caused by the class imbalance ratio, which will increase the accuracy disparity compared to standard training. The research extends beyond the Gaussian mixture model by generalizing to the general family of stable distributions, showing that while the constraint of adversarial robustness consistently degrades the standard accuracy in the balanced class setting, the class imbalance ratio plays a fundamentally different role in accuracy disparity compared to the Gaussian case, due to the heavy tail of the stable distribution.},

The authors carry out a first-of-its-kind study unveiling that modern large-kernel ConvNets, a compelling competitor to Vision Transformers, are remarkably more effective teachers for small-kernel ConvNets, due to more similar architectures. They obtain the best-ever pure ConvNet under 30M parameters with 83.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, outperforming current SOTA methods including ConvNeXt V2 and Swin V2.

The left matrix enables expressive function approximation for value-based learning and has been studied extensively. In this work, we instead investigate sample-efficient learning with density features, i.e., the right matrix, which induce powerful models for state-occupancy distributions. This setting not only sheds light on leveraging unsupervised learning in RL, but also enables plug-in solutions for settings like convex RL. In the offline setting, we propose an algorithm for off-policy estimation of occupancies that can handle non-exploratory data. Using this as a subroutine, we further devise an online algorithm that constructs exploratory data distributions in a level-by-level manner. As a central technical challenge, the additive error of occupancy estimation is incompatible with the multiplicative definition of data coverage. In the absence of strong assumptions like reachability, this incompatibility easily leads to exponential error blow-up, which we overcome via novel technical tools. Our results also readily extend to the representation learning setting, when the density features are unknown and must be learned from an exponentially large candidate set.},

This work offers a new generation paradigm that allows flexible control of the output image, such as spatial layout and palette, while maintaining the synthesis quality and model creativity. With compositionality as the core idea, we first decompose an image into representative factors, and then train a diffusion model with all these factors as the conditions to recompose the input. At the inference stage, the rich intermediate representations work as composable elements, leading to a huge design space (i.e., exponentially proportional to the number of decomposed factors) for customizable content creation. It is noteworthy that our approach, which we call Composer, supports various levels of conditions, such as text description as the global information, depth map and sketch as the local guidance, color histogram for low-level details, etc. Besides improving controllability, we confirm that Composer serves as a general framework and facilitates a wide range of classical generative tasks without retraining.

However, most of the clustering methods merely generate pseudo labels and thus are unable to simultaneously present the similarities between different clusters and outliers. This paper proposes a new framework called High-dimensional Clustering onto Hamiltonian Cycle (HCHC) to solve the above problems. First, HCHC combines global structure with local structure in one objective function for deep clustering, improving the labels as relative probabilities, to mine the similarities between different clusters while keeping the local structure in each cluster. Then, the anchors of different clusters are sorted on the optimal Hamiltonian cycle generated by the cluster similarities and mapped on the circumference of a circle. Finally, a sample with a higher probability of a cluster will be mapped closer to the corresponding anchor. In this way, our framework allows us to appreciate three aspects visually and simultaneously -- clusters (formed by samples with high probabilities), cluster similarities (represented as circular distances), and outliers (recognized as dots far away from all clusters). The experiments illustrate the superiority of HCHC.},

However, the most common InfoNCE-based methods suffer from some dilemmas, such as uniformity-tolerance dilemma (UTD) and gradient reduction, both of which are related to a $\mathcal{P}_{ij}$ term. It has been identified that UTD can lead to unexpected performance degradation. We argue that the fixity of temperature is to blame for UTD. To tackle this challenge, we enrich the CL loss family by presenting a Model-Aware Contrastive Learning (MACL) strategy, whose temperature is adaptive to the magnitude of alignment that reflects the basic confidence of the instance discrimination task, then enables CL loss to adjust the penalty strength for hard negatives adaptively. Regarding another dilemma, the gradient reduction issue, we derive the limits of an involved gradient scaling factor, which allows us to explain from a unified perspective why some recent approaches are effective with fewer negative samples, and summarily present a gradient reweighting to escape this dilemma. Extensive remarkable empirical results in vision, sentence, and graph modality validate our approach's general improvement for representation learning and downstream tasks.},

To achieve better communication cost for the problem with faster local running time, we propose an inliers-recalling sampling method, which avoids guessing the optimal radius of the given instance, and can achieve a 4-round bi-criteria approximation with linear local running time in the data size and communication cost independent of the aspect ratio. We also propose a space-narrowing sampling method that automatically adjusts sample size to adapt to different outliers distributions and achieves a 2-round bi-criteria approximation with communication cost independent of the number of outliers. Furthermore, we extend our algorithms to k-median and k-means problems with outliers, achieving good approximation ratios with communication cost independent of the number of outliers when data points are randomly partitioned across machines.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach, CL-LNS, that delivers state-of-the-art anytime performance on several ILP benchmarks measured by metrics including the primal gap, the primal integral, survival rates and the best performing rate. Specifically, CL-LNS collects positive and negative solution samples from an expert heuristic that is slow to compute and learns a new one with a contrastive loss.

  abstract     = {This paper considers constructing small coresets for k-Median in Euclidean spaces, where given a large set of data points P ⊂ ℝᵈ, a coreset is a much smaller set S ⊂ ℝᵈ, so that the k-Median costs of any k centers w.r.t. P and S are close. Existing literature mainly focuses on the high-dimension case and there has been great success in obtaining dimension-independent bounds, whereas the case for small d is largely unexplored. Considering many applications of Euclidean clustering algorithms are in small dimensions and the lack of systematic studies in the current literature, this paper investigates coresets for k-Median in small dimensions. For small d, a natural question is whether existing near-optimal dimension-independent bounds can be significantly improved. We provide affirmative answers to this question for a range of parameters. We also provide new lower bound results, which are the highest for small d. In particular, we completely settle the coreset size bound for 1-d k-Median (up to log factors). Interestingly, our results imply a strong separation between 1-d 1-Median and 1-d 2-Median. As far as we know, this is the first such separation between k=1 and k=2 in any dimension.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale multimodal generative modeling has created milestones in text-to-image and text-to-video generation. Its application to audio still lags behind for two main reasons: the lack of large-scale datasets with high-quality text-audio pairs, and the complexity of modeling long continuous audio data. In this work, we propose Make-An-Audio with a prompt-enhanced diffusion model that addresses these gaps by 1) introducing pseudo prompt enhancement with a distill-then-reprogram approach, it alleviates data scarcity with orders of magnitude concept compositions by using language-free audios; 2) leveraging spectrogram autoencoder to predict the self-supervised audio representation instead of waveforms. Together with robust contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) representations, Make-An-Audio achieves state-of-the-art results in both objective and subjective benchmark evaluation. Moreover, we present its controllability and generalization for X-to-Audio with "No Modality Left Behind", for the first time unlocking the ability to generate high-definition, high-fidelity audios given a user-defined modality input.},

We relate the query complexity for approximating k-Median, to a key parameter of the dataset, called the balancedness β ∈ (0, 1] (with 1 being perfectly balanced). We show that any algorithm must make Ω(1/β) queries to the point set in order to achieve O(1)-approximation for k-Median. This particularly implies existing constructions of coresets, a popular data reduction technique, cannot be query-efficient. On the other hand, we show a simple uniform sample of poly(k ε⁻¹ β⁻¹) points suffices for (1 + ε)-approximation for k-Median for various metric spaces, which nearly matches the lower bound. Experiments verify that in many real datasets, the balancedness parameter is usually well bounded, and that the uniform sampling performs consistently well even for the case with moderately large balancedness, which justifies that uniform sampling is indeed a viable approach for solving k-Median.},

To achieve this, we propose a principled framework that models the continuous RL policy as a generative model of optimal trajectories. By conditioning the policy on a latent variable, we derive a novel variational bound as the optimization objective, which promotes exploration of the environment. We then present a practical model-based RL method, called Reparameterized Policy Gradient (RPG), which leverages the multimodal policy parameterization and learned world model to achieve strong exploration capabilities and high data efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RPG on a suite of multimodal continuous control tasks, showing that RPG outperforms existing methods in terms of sample efficiency and final performance.},

  abstract     = {Neural networks have shown great potential in accelerating the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). Recently, there has been a growing interest in introducing physics constraints into training neural PDE solvers to reduce the use of costly data and improve the generalization ability. However, these physics constraints, based on certain finite dimensional approximations over the function space, must resolve the smallest scaled physics to ensure the accuracy and stability of the simulation, resulting in high computational costs from large input, output, and neural networks. This paper proposes a general acceleration methodology called NeuralStagger by spatially and temporally decomposing the original learning tasks into several coarser-resolution subtasks. We define a coarse-resolution neural solver for each subtask, which requires fewer computational resources, and jointly train them with the vanilla physics-constrained loss by simply arranging their outputs to reconstruct the original solution. Due to the perfect parallelism between them, the solution is achieved as fast as a coarse-resolution neural solver. In addition, the trained solvers bring the flexibility of simulating with multiple levels of resolution. We demonstrate the successful application of NeuralStagger on 2D and 3D fluid dynamics simulations, which leads to an additional $10\sim100\times$ speed-up. Moreover, the experiment also shows that the learned model could be well used for optimal control.},

  abstract     = {Adversarial imitation learning (AIL) is a popular method that has recently achieved much success. However, the performance of AIL is still unsatisfactory on the more challenging tasks. We find that one of the major reasons is due to the low quality of AIL discriminator representation. Since the AIL discriminator is trained via binary classification that does not necessarily discriminate the policy from the expert in a meaningful way, the resulting reward might not be meaningful either. We propose a new method called Policy Contrastive Imitation Learning (PCIL) to resolve this issue. PCIL learns a contrastive representation space by anchoring on different policies and uses a smooth cosine-similarity-based reward to encourage imitation learning. Our proposed representation learning objective can be viewed as a stronger version of the AIL objective and provide a more meaningful comparison between the agent and the policy. From a theoretical perspective, we show the validity of our method using the apprenticeship learning framework. Furthermore, our empirical evaluation on the DeepMind Control suite demonstrates that PCIL can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Finally, qualitative results suggest that PCIL builds a smoother and more meaningful representation space for imitation learning.},

  abstract     = {Federated bilevel learning has received increasing attention in various emerging machine learning and communication applications. Recently, several Hessian-vector-based algorithms have been proposed to solve the federated bilevel optimization problem. However, several important properties in federated learning such as the partial client participation and the linear speedup for convergence (i.e., the convergence rate and complexity are improved linearly with respect to the number of sampled clients) in the presence of non-i.i.d. datasets, still remain open. In this paper, we fill these gaps by proposing a new federated bilevel algorithm named FedMBO with a novel client sampling scheme in the federated hypergradient estimation. We show that FedMBO achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{nK}}+\frac{1}{K}+\frac{\sqrt{n}}{K^{3/2}}\big)$ on non-i.i.d. datasets, where $n$ is the number of participating clients in each round, and $K$ is the total number of iteration. This is the first theoretical linear speedup result for non-i.i.d. federated bilevel optimization. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

We then formally introduce user-level central DP (CDP) and local DP (LDP) in the federated bandits framework, and investigate the fundamental trade-offs between the learning regrets and the corresponding DP guarantees in a federated linear contextual bandits model. For CDP, we propose a federated algorithm termed as $\texttt{ROBIN}$ and show that it is near-optimal in terms of the number of clients $M$ and the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ by deriving nearly-matching upper and lower regret bounds when user-level DP is satisfied. For LDP, we obtain several lower bounds, indicating that learning under user-level $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-LDP must suffer a regret blow-up factor at least $\min\{1/\varepsilon,M\}$ or $\min\{1/\sqrt{\varepsilon},\sqrt{M}\}$ under different conditions.},

We find that the main cause of training instability is the discrepancy between the model embedding and the code-vector distribution. We identify the factors that contribute to this issue, including the codebook gradient sparsity and the asymmetric nature of the commitment loss, which leads to misaligned code-vector assignments. We propose to address this issue via affine re-parameterization of the code vectors. Additionally, we introduce an alternating optimization to reduce the gradient error introduced by the straight-through estimation. Moreover, we propose an improvement to the commitment loss to ensure better alignment between the codebook representation and the model embedding. These optimization methods improve the mathematical approximation of the straight-through estimation and, ultimately, the model performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on several common model architectures, such as AlexNet, ResNet, and ViT, across various tasks, including image classification and generative modeling.},

Recent work (Hui \& Belkin, 2020) suggests that training using the (rescaled) square loss is often superior in terms of the classification accuracy. In this paper we propose the ``squentropy'' loss, which is the sum of two terms: the cross-entropy loss and the average square loss over the incorrect classes. We provide an extensive set of experiment on multi-class classification problems showing that the squentropy loss outperforms both the pure cross-entropy and rescaled square losses in terms of the classification accuracy. We also demonstrate that it provides significantly better model calibration than either of these alternative losses and, furthermore, has less variance with respect to the random initialization. Additionally, in contrast to the square loss, squentropy loss can frequently be trained using exactly the same optimization parameters, including the learning rate, as the standard cross-entropy loss, making it a true ``plug-and-play'' replacement. Finally, unlike the rescaled square loss, multiclass squentropy contains no parameters that need to be adjusted.},

We propose the SOM-CPC model, which jointly optimizes Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC), and a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to find such an organized manifold. We address a largely unexplored and challenging set of scenarios comprising high-rate time series, and show on synthetic and real-life medical and audio data that SOM-CPC outperforms strong baseline models that combine DL with SOMs. SOM-CPC has great potential to expose latent patterns in high-rate data streams, and may therefore contribute to a better understanding of many different processes and systems.},

Outside of these classes, learning dynamics rarely converge and little is known about the effect of exploration in the face of non-convergence. To progress this front, we study the smooth Q-Learning dynamics. We show that, in any network game, exploration by agents results in the convergence of Q-Learning to a neighbourhood of an equilibrium. This holds independently of whether the dynamics reach the equilibrium or display complex behaviours. We show that increasing the exploration rate decreases the size of this neighbourhood and also decreases the ability of all agents to improve their payoffs. Furthermore, in a broad class of games, the payoff performance of Q-Learning dynamics, measured by Social Welfare, decreases when the exploration rate increases. Our experiments show this to be a general phenomenon, namely that exploration leads to improved convergence of Q-Learning, at the cost of payoff performance.},

This ability is considered a necessary passing point for achieving human-level intelligence. To achieve this ability, previous unsupervised approaches mainly focused on learning the disentangled representation, such as the variational autoencoder. However, recent studies discovered that the disentangled representation is insufficient for combinatorial generalization and is not even correlated. In this regard, we propose a novel framework for data generation that can robustly generalize under these distribution shift situations. Instead of representing each data, our model discovers the fundamental transformation between a pair of data by simulating a group action. To test the combinatorial generalizability, we evaluated our model in two settings: Recombination-to-Element and Recombination-to-Range. The experiments demonstrated that our method has quantitatively and qualitatively superior generalizability and generates better images than traditional models.},

  abstract     = {Multi-View Reinforcement Learning (MVRL) seeks to find an optimal control for an agent given multi-view observations from various sources. Despite recent advances in multi-view learning that aim to extract the latent representation from multi-view data, it is not straightforward to apply them to control tasks, especially when the observations are temporally dependent on one another. The problem can be even more challenging if the observations are intermittently missing for a subset of views. In this paper, we introduce Fuse2Control (F2C), an information-theoretic approach to capturing the underlying state space model from the sequences of multi-view observations. We conduct an extensive set of experiments in various control tasks showing that our method is highly effective in aggregating task-relevant information across many views, that scales linearly with the number of views while retaining robustness to arbitrary missing view scenarios.},

Recent works show that Bayesian model selection with Laplace approximations can allow to optimize such hyperparameters just like standard neural network parameters using gradients and on the training data. However, estimating a single hyperparameter gradient requires a pass through the entire dataset, limiting the scalability of such algorithms. In this work, we overcome this issue by introducing lower bounds to the linearized Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood. In contrast to previous estimators, these bounds are amenable to stochastic-gradient-based optimization and allow to trade off estimation accuracy against computational complexity. We derive them using the function-space form of the linearized Laplace, which can be estimated using the neural tangent kernel. Experimentally, we show that our estimators can significantly accelerate gradient-based hyperparameter optimization.},

Despite the generality of the model class, we show the causal direction is identifiable up to some pathological cases. To empirically validate these theoretical findings, we propose two estimators for LSNMs: an estimator based on (non-linear) feature maps, and one based on neural networks. Both model the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$ as a Gaussian parameterized by its natural parameters. When the feature maps are correctly specified, we prove that our estimator is jointly concave, and a consistent estimator for the cause-effect identification task.},

We initiate the study of differentially-private approximation algorithms for hierarchical clustering under the rigorous framework introduced by Dasgupta (2016). We show strong lower bounds for the problem: that any $\varepsilon$-DP algorithm must exhibit $O(|V|^2/\varepsilon)$-additive error for an input dataset $V$. Then, we exhibit a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with $O(|V|^{2.5}/\varepsilon)$-additive error, and an exponential-time algorithm that meets the lower bound. To overcome the lower bound, we focus on the stochastic block model. We design a private $1+o(1)$ approximation algorithm which also recovers the blocks exactly. Finally, we perform an empirical evaluation of our techniques and show that they can achieve good performance on realistic datasets.},

NNAIF intelligently combines the established literature on implicit filtering (IF) optimization methods with a neural network (NN) surrogate model of the objective function, resulting in accelerated derivative free methods for unconstrained optimization problems. The NN surrogate model consists of a fixed number of parameters, which can be as few as $\approx 1.3 \times 10^{4}$, that are updated as NNAIF progresses. We show that NNAIF directly inherits the convergence properties of IF optimization methods, and thus NNAIF is guaranteed to converge towards a critical point of the objective function under appropriate assumptions. Numerical experiments with $31$ noisy problems from the CUTEst optimization benchmark set demonstrate the benefits and costs associated with NNAIF.},

  abstract     = {Learning to control an agent from offline data collected in a rich pixel-based visual observation space is vital for real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL). A major challenge in this setting is the presence of input information that is hard to model and irrelevant to controlling the agent. This problem has been approached by the theoretical RL community through the lens of ``exogenous information'', i.e., any control-irrelevant information contained in observations. For example, a robot navigating in busy streets needs to ignore irrelevant information, such as other people walking in the background, textures of objects, or birds in the sky. In this paper, we focus on the setting with visually detailed exogenous information, and introduce new offline RL benchmarks that offer the ability to study this problem. We find that contemporary representation learning techniques can fail on datasets where the noise is a complex, time-dependent process -- which is prevalent in practical applications.},

This work explores the latent space of such deep generative models. A key issue with these models is their tendency to output samples outside of the support of the target distribution when learning disconnected distributions. We investigate the relationship between the performance of these models and the geometry of their latent space. Building on recent developments in geometric measure theory, we prove a sufficient condition for optimality in the case where the dimension of the latent space is larger than the number of modes. Through experiments on GANs, we demonstrate the validity of our theoretical results and gain new insights into the latent space geometry of these models. Additionally, we propose a truncation method that enforces a simplicial cluster structure in the latent space and improves the performance of GANs.},

In addition, to accommodate discrete actions within our framework, we propose leveraging continuous relaxation schemes, which can naturally be integrated into our variational objective. As a result, CO-BED provides a general and automated solution to a wide range of contextual optimization problems. We illustrate its effectiveness in a number of experiments, where CO-BED demonstrates competitive performance even when compared to bespoke, model-specific alternatives.},

Empirically, we consider a broad range of vision and language transfer learning tasks, and show that DoG's performance is close to that of SGD with tuned learning rate. We also propose a per-layer variant of DoG that generally outperforms tuned SGD, approaching the performance of tuned Adam.

While there has been considerable theoretical and empirical analysis of how large the learning rate can be, most prior work focuses only on late-stage training. In this work, we introduce the maximal initial learning rate $\eta^{\ast}$ - the largest learning rate at which a randomly initialized neural network can successfully begin training and achieve (at least) a given threshold accuracy. Using a simple approach to estimate $\eta^{\ast}$, we observe that in constant-width fully-connected ReLU networks, $\eta^{\ast}$ behaves differently from the maximum learning rate later in training. Specifically, we find that $\eta^{\ast}$ is well predicted as a power of depth $\times$ width, provided that (i) the width of the network is sufficiently large compared to the depth, and (ii) the input layer is trained at a relatively small learning rate. We further analyze the relationship between $\eta^{\ast}$ and the sharpness $\lambda_{1}$ of the network at initialization, indicating they are closely though not inversely related. We formally prove bounds for $\lambda_{1}$ in terms of depth $\times$ width that align with our empirical results.},

To do this, simple parametric models are frequently used (e.g. coefficients of linear regression) but always fitted on the whole dataset. However, it is common that the covariates may not have a uniform effect over the whole population and thus a unified simple model can miss the heterogeneous signal. For example, a linear model may be able to explain a subset of the data but fail on the rest due to the nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the data. In this paper, we propose DDGroup (data-driven group discovery), a data-driven method to effectively identify subgroups in the data with a uniform linear relationship between the features and the label. DDGroup outputs an interpretable region in which the linear model is expected to hold. It is simple to implement and computationally tractable for use. We show theoretically that, given a large enough sample, DDGroup recovers a region where a single linear model with low variance is well-specified (if one exists), and experiments on real-world medical datasets confirm that it can discover regions where a local linear model has improved performance. Our experiments also show that DDGroup can uncover subgroups with qualitatively different relationships which are missed by simply applying parametric approaches to the whole dataset.},

We propose the Recurrent Interface Network (RIN), an attention-based architecture that decouples its core computation from the dimensionality of the data, enabling adaptive computation for more scalable generation of high-dimensional data. RINs focus the bulk of computation (i.e. global self-attention) on a set of latent tokens, using cross-attention to read and write (i.e. route) information between latent and data tokens. Stacking RIN blocks allows bottom-up (data to latent) and top-down (latent to data) feedback, leading to deeper and more expressive routing. While this routing introduces challenges, this is less problematic in recurrent computation settings where the task (and routing problem) changes gradually, such as iterative generation with diffusion models. We show how to leverage recurrence by conditioning the latent tokens at each forward pass of the reverse diffusion process with those from prior computation, i.e. latent self-conditioning. RINs yield state-of-the-art pixel diffusion models for image and video generation, scaling to1024×1024 images without cascades or guidance, while being domain-agnostic and up to 10× more efficient than 2D and 3D U-Nets.},

In many applications of machine learning such as drug discovery and material design, the goal is to generate candidates which simultaneously optimize a set of potentially conflicting objectives. Moreover, these objectives are often imperfect evaluations of some underlying property of interest, making it important to generate diverse candidates to have multiple options for expensive downstream evaluations. We propose Multi-Objective GFlowNets (MOGFNs), a novel method for generating diverse Pareto optimal solutions, based on GFlowNets. We introduce two variants of MOGFNs: MOGFN-PC, which models a family of independent sub-problems defined by a scalarization function, with reward-conditional GFlowNets, and MOGFN-AL, which solves a sequence of sub-problems defined by an acquisition function in an active learning loop. Our experiments on wide variety of synthetic and benchmark tasks demonstrate advantages of the proposed methods in terms of the Pareto performance and importantly, improved candidate diversity, which is the main contribution of this work.},

In this work, we are interested in exploring a principled way to scale GNNs capacity without deepening or widening, which can improve its performance across multiple small and large graphs. By dividing giant graph data, we build multiple independently and parallelly trained weaker GNNs (soup ingredient) without any intermediate communication, and combine their strength using a greedy interpolation soup procedure to achieve state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Large pre-trained transformers have been receiving explosive attention in the past few years, due to their acculturation for numerous downstream applications via fine-tuning, but their exponentially increasing parameter counts are becoming a primary hurdle to even just fine-tune them without industry-standard hardware. Recently, Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) and its variants, have been exploited to prune these large pre-trained models generating subnetworks which can achieve similar performance as their dense counterparts, but LTH pragmatism is enormously inhibited by repetitive full training and pruning routine of iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) which worsens with increasing model size. Motivated by the recent observations of model soups, which suggest that fine-tuned weights of multiple models can be merged to a better minima, we propose Instant Soup Pruning (ISP) to generate lottery ticket quality subnetworks, using a fraction of the original IMP cost by replacing the expensive intermediate pruning stages of IMP with computationally efficient weak mask generation and aggregation routine. More specifically, during the mask generation stage, ISP takes a small handful of iterations using varying training protocols and data subsets to generate many weak and noisy subnetworks, and superpose them to average out the noise creating a high-quality denoised subnetwork. Our extensive experiments and ablation on two popular large-scale pre-trained models: CLIP (unexplored in pruning till date) and BERT across multiple benchmark vision and language datasets validate the effectiveness of ISP compared to several state-of-the-art pruning methods.},

Previous work has shown that scaling the number of training tasks is the key component in making stronger MT LMs. In this work, we report an unexpected finding that an expert LM fine-tuned on just a single task can outperform an MT LM trained with 300+ different tasks on 11 different unseen datasets and on 13 datasets of the BIG-bench benchmark by a mean accuracy of 3.20\% and 1.29\%, respectively. This finding casts doubt on the previously held belief that simply scaling the number of tasks makes stronger MT LMs. Leveraging this finding, we further show that this distributed approach of training a separate expert LM per training task instead of a single MT LM for zero-shot inference possesses many benefits including (1) avoiding negative task transfer that often occurs during instruction tuning, (2) being able to continually learn new tasks without having to re-train on previous tasks to avoid catastrophic forgetting, and (3) showing compositional capabilities when merging individual experts together.},

Based on our observations on 1) high correlation between past weights and future weights, 2) conditions for beneficial weight prediction, and 3) feasibility of weight prediction, we propose a more general framework by intermittently skipping a handful of epochs by periodically forecasting near future weights, i.e., a Weight Nowcaster Network (WNN). As an add-on module, WNN predicts the future weights to make the learning process faster regardless of tasks and architectures. Experimental results show that WNN can significantly save actual time cost for training with an additional marginal time to train WNN. We validate the generalization capability of WNN under various tasks, and demonstrate that it works well even for unseen tasks.},

Interpreting its reconstruction process as a nonlinear transformation of samples from the latent posterior distribution, we apply the Unscented Transform (UT) -- a well-known distribution approximation used in the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) from the field of filtering. A finite set of statistics called sigma points, sampled deterministically, provides a more informative and lower-variance posterior representation than the ubiquitous noise-scaling of the reparameterization trick, while ensuring higher-quality reconstruction. We further boost the performance by replacing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with the Wasserstein distribution metric that allows for a sharper posterior. Inspired by the two components, we derive a novel, deterministic-sampling flavor of the VAE, the Unscented Autoencoder (UAE), trained purely with regularization-like terms on the per-sample posterior. We empirically show competitive performance in Fréchet Inception Distance scores over closely-related models, in addition to a lower training variance than the VAE.},

  abstract     = {Consider the problem of exploration in sparse-reward or reward-free environments, such as in Montezuma's Revenge. In the curiosity-driven paradigm, the agent is rewarded for how much each realized outcome differs from their predicted outcome. But using predictive error as intrinsic motivation is fragile in stochastic environments, as the agent may become trapped by high-entropy areas of the state-action space, such as a 'noisy TV'. In this work, we study a natural solution derived from structural causal models of the world: Our key idea is to learn representations of the future that capture precisely the unpredictable aspects of each outcome -- which we use as additional input for predictions, such that intrinsic rewards only reflect the predictable aspects of world dynamics. First, we propose incorporating such hindsight representations into models to disentangle 'noise' from 'novelty', yielding Curiosity in Hindsight: a simple and scalable generalization of curiosity that is robust to stochasticity. Second, we instantiate this framework for the recently introduced BYOL-Explore algorithm as our prime example, resulting in the noise-robust BYOL-Hindsight. Third, we illustrate its behavior under a variety of different stochasticities in a grid world, and find improvements over BYOL-Explore in hard-exploration Atari games with sticky actions. Notably, we show state-of-the-art results in exploring Montezuma's Revenge with sticky actions, while preserving performance in the non-sticky setting.},

Humans, on the other hand, have a remarkable ability to acquire, assimilate, and transfer knowledge across tasks throughout their lifetime without catastrophic forgetting. The versatility of the brain can be attributed to the rehearsal of abstract experiences through a complementary learning system. However, representation rehearsal in vision transformers lacks diversity, resulting in overfitting and consequently, performance drops significantly compared to raw image rehearsal. Therefore, we propose {BiRT}, a novel representation rehearsal-based continual learning approach using vision transformers. Specifically, we introduce controllable noises at various stages of the vision transformer and enforce consistency in predictions with respect to an exponential moving average of the working model. Our method provides consistent performance gain over raw image and vanilla representation rehearsal on several challenging CL benchmarks while being memory efficient and robust to natural and adversarial corruptions.},

Most previous work has focused on designing an efficient algorithm to recover only the ground-truth labels of the data. In this paper, we consider multi-choice crowdsourcing tasks with the goal of recovering not only the ground truth, but also the most confusing answer and the confusion probability. The most confusing answer provides useful information about the task by revealing the most plausible answer other than the ground truth and how plausible it is. To theoretically analyze such scenarios, we propose a model in which there are the top two plausible answers for each task, distinguished from the rest of the choices. Task difficulty is quantified by the probability of confusion between the top two, and worker reliability is quantified by the probability of giving an answer among the top two. Under this model, we propose a two-stage inference algorithm to infer both the top two answers and the confusion probability. We show that our algorithm achieves the minimax optimal convergence rate. We conduct both synthetic and real data experiments and demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other recent algorithms. We also show the applicability of our algorithms in inferring the difficulty of tasks and in training neural networks with top-two soft labels.},

A softmax layer often outputs a label prediction based on the largest logit. We demonstrate that it is possible to infer hidden graph structural information from the dataset using these logits. We introduce the key notion of label non-uniformity, which is derived from the Wasserstein distance between the softmax distribution of the logits and the uniform distribution. We demonstrate that nodes with small label non-uniformity are harder to classify correctly. We theoretically analyze how the label non-uniformity varies across the graph, which provides insights into boosting the model performance: increasing training samples with high non-uniformity or dropping edges to reduce the maximal cut size of the node set of small non-uniformity. These mechanisms can be easily added to a base GNN model. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of many benchmark base models.},

However, there is still a lack of sufficient theoretical guidance on how to alleviate this problem. In this paper, we propose a general theoretical framework that demonstrates how distribution discrepancies caused by pseudo-label predictions and target predictions can lead to severe generalization errors. Through theoretical analysis, we identify three main reasons why previous SSL algorithms cannot perform well with inconsistent distributions: coupling between the pseudo-label predictor and the target predictor, biased pseudo labels, and restricted sample weights. To address these challenges, we introduce a practical framework called Bidirectional Adaptation that can adapt to the distribution of unlabeled data for debiased pseudo-label prediction and to the target distribution for debiased target prediction, thereby mitigating these shortcomings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.},

As a particularly challenging scenario, these items may (i) arrive in high volume, with thousands of new items being released per hour, and (ii) have short lifetime, say, due to the item's transient nature or underlying non-stationarity that impels the platform to perceive the same item as distinct copies over time. Thus motivated, we study a Bayesian multiple-play bandit problem that encapsulates the key features of the multivariate testing (or ``multi-A/B testing'') problem with a high volume of short-lived arms. In each round, a set of k arms arrive, each available for w rounds. Without knowing the mean reward for each arm, the learner selects a multiset of n arms and immediately observes their realized rewards. We aim to minimize the loss due to not knowing the mean rewards, averaged over instances generated from a given prior distribution. We show that if k = O(n^ρ) for some ρ > 0, our policy achieves O(n^{-min{ρ, 1/2(1+1/w)^{-1}}}) average loss on a sufficiently large class of prior distributions.},

  abstract     = {In many applications of online decision making, the environment is non-stationary and it is therefore crucial to use bandit algorithms that handle changes. Most existing approaches are designed to protect against non-smooth changes, constrained only by total variation or Lipschitzness over time. However, in practice, environments often change smoothly, so such algorithms may incur higher-than-necessary regret. We study a non-stationary bandits problem where each arm's mean reward sequence can be embedded into a $β$-Hölder function, i.e., a function that is $(β-1)$-times Lipschitz-continuously differentiable. The non-stationarity becomes more smooth as $β$ increases. When $β=1$, this corresponds to the non-smooth regime, where previous work established a minimax regret of $\tilde{\Theta}(T^{2/3})$. We show the first separation between the smooth (i.e., $β \geq 2$) and non-smooth (i.e., $β=1$) regimes by presenting a policy with $\tilde{O}(k^{4/5} T^{3/5})$ regret on any $k$-armed, $2$-Hölder instance. We complement this result by showing that the minimax regret on the $β$-Hölder family of instances is $Ω(T^{(β+1)/(2β+1)})$ for any integer $β \geq 1$. This matches our upper bound for $β=2$ up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, we validated the effectiveness of our policy through a comprehensive numerical study using real-world click-through rate data.},

  abstract     = {Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention for their energy-efficient and fast-inference capabilities, but training SNNs from scratch can be challenging due to the discrete nature of spikes. One alternative method is to convert an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) into an SNN, known as ANN-SNN conversion. Currently, existing ANN-SNN conversion methods often involve redesigning the ANN with a new activation function, rather than utilizing the traditional ReLU, and converting it to an SNN. However, these methods do not take into account the potential performance loss between the regular ANN with ReLU and the tailored ANN. In this work, we propose a unified optimization framework for ANN-SNN conversion that considers both performance loss and conversion error. To achieve this, we introduce the SlipReLU activation function, which is a weighted sum of the threshold-ReLU and the step function. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that conversion error can be zero on a range of shift values $δ \in [-0.5,0.5]$ rather than a fixed shift term 0.5. We evaluate our SlipReLU method on CIFAR datasets, which shows that SlipReLU outperforms current ANN-SNN conversion methods and supervised training methods in terms of accuracy and latency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ANN-SNN conversion method that enables SNN inference using only 1 time step.},

Yet task specification in robotics comes in various forms, such as imitating one-shot demonstrations, following language instructions, and reaching visual goals. They are often considered different tasks and tackled by specialized models. We show that a wide spectrum of robot manipulation tasks can be expressed with multimodal prompts, interleaving textual and visual tokens. Accordingly, we develop a new simulation benchmark that consists of thousands of procedurally-generated tabletop tasks with multimodal prompts, 600K+ expert trajectories for imitation learning, and a four-level evaluation protocol for systematic generalization. We design a transformer-based robot agent, VIMA, that processes these prompts and outputs motor actions autoregressively. VIMA features a recipe that achieves strong model scalability and data efficiency. It outperforms alternative designs in the hardest zero-shot generalization setting by up to $2.9\times$ task success rate given the same training data. With $10\times$ less training data, VIMA still performs $2.7\times$ better than the best competing variant.},

Compared to multi-task GP, CMDE efficiently handles high-dimensional and multi-modal covariates and provides pointwise uncertainty estimates of causal effects. We evaluate our method across various types of datasets and tasks and find that CMDE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a majority of these tasks.},

  abstract     = {We study the online restless bandit problem, where each arm evolves according to a Markov chain independently, and the reward of pulling an arm depends on both the current state of the corresponding Markov chain and the pulled arm. The agent (decision maker) does not know the transition functions and reward functions, and cannot observe the states of arms even after pulling. The goal is to sequentially choose which arms to pull so as to maximize the expected cumulative rewards collected. In this paper, we propose TSEETC, a learning algorithm based on Thompson Sampling with Episodic Explore-Then-Commit. The algorithm proceeds in episodes of increasing length and each episode is divided into exploration and exploitation phases. During the exploration phase, samples of action-reward pairs are collected in a round-robin fashion and utilized to update the posterior distribution as a mixture of Dirichlet distributions. At the beginning of the exploitation phase, TSEETC generates a sample from the posterior distribution as true parameters. It then follows the optimal policy for the sampled model for the rest of the episode. We establish the Bayesian regret bound $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ for TSEETC, where $T$ is the time horizon. We show through simulations that TSEETC outperforms existing algorithms in regret.},

However, some representative methods share an unproven assumption that the probability that OOD data belong to every ID class should be the same, i.e., these OOD-to-ID probabilities actually form a uniform distribution. In this paper, we show that this assumption makes the above methods incapable when the ID model is trained with class-imbalanced data. Fortunately, by analyzing the causal relations between ID/OOD classes and features, we identify several common scenarios where the OOD-to-ID probabilities should be the ID-class-prior distribution and propose two strategies to modify existing inference-time detection methods: 1) replace the uniform distribution with the ID-class-prior distribution if they explicitly use the uniform distribution; 2) otherwise, reweight their scores according to the similarity between the ID-class-prior distribution and the softmax outputs of the pre-trained model. Extensive experiments show that both strategies can improve the OOD detection performance when the ID model is pre-trained with imbalanced data, reflecting the importance of ID-class prior in OOD detection.},

We link these issues to the coordinate descent strategy used in existing methods and address this by introducing Fast-{EG}-$\ell_1$, an efficient adversarial training algorithm based on Euclidean geometry and free of coordinate descent. Fast-{EG}-$\ell_1$ comes with no additional memory costs and no extra hyper-parameters to tune.

  abstract     = {Learning unnormalized statistical models (e.g., energy-based models) is computationally challenging due to the complexity of handling the partition function. To eschew this complexity, noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) has been proposed by formulating the objective as the logistic loss of the real data and the artificial noise. However, as found in previous works, NCE may perform poorly in many tasks due to its flat loss landscape and slow convergence. In this paper, we study a direct approach for optimizing the negative log-likelihood of unnormalized models from the perspective of compositional optimization. To tackle the partition function, a noise distribution is introduced such that the log partition function can be written as a compositional function whose inner function can be estimated with stochastic samples. Hence, the objective can be optimized by stochastic compositional optimization algorithms. Despite being a simple method, we demonstrate that it is more favorable than NCE by (1) establishing a fast convergence rate and quantifying its dependence on the noise distribution through the variance of stochastic estimators; (2) developing better results for one-dimensional Gaussian mean estimation by showing our objective has a much favorable loss landscape and hence our method enjoys faster convergence; (3) demonstrating better performance on multiple applications, including density estimation, out-of-distribution detection, and real image generation.},

Sound and complete algorithms have been developed for pointwise estimation of identifiable causal queries. For non-identifiable causal queries, researchers developed polynomial programs to estimate tight bounds on causal effect. However, these are computationally difficult to optimize for variables with large support sizes. In this paper, we analyze the effect of weak confounding on causal estimands. More specifically, under the assumption that the unobserved confounders that render a query non-identifiable have small entropy, we propose an efficient linear program to derive the upper and lower bounds of the causal effect. We show that our bounds are consistent in the sense that as the entropy of unobserved confounders goes to zero, the gap between the upper and lower bound vanishes. Finally, we conduct synthetic and real data simulations to compare our bounds with the bounds obtained by the existing work that cannot incorporate such entropy constraints and show that our bounds are tighter for the setting with weak confounders.},

This word learning capability is believed to be the most fundamental building block of multimodal understanding and reasoning. Despite recent advancements in multimodal learning, a systematic and rigorous evaluation is still missing for human-like word learning in machines. To fill in this gap, we introduce the MachinE Word Learning (MEWL) benchmark to assess how machines learn word meaning in grounded visual scenes. MEWL covers human's core cognitive toolkits in word learning: cross-situational reasoning, bootstrapping, and pragmatic learning. Specifically, MEWL is a few-shot benchmark suite consisting of nine tasks for probing various word learning capabilities. These tasks are carefully designed to be aligned with the children's core abilities in word learning and echo the theories in the developmental literature. By evaluating multimodal and unimodal agents' performance with a comparative analysis of human performance, we notice a sharp divergence in human and machine word learning. We further discuss these differences between humans and machines and call for human-like few-shot word learning in machines.},

  abstract     = {Learning-based high-fidelity reconstruction of 3D shapes with varying topology is a fundamental problem in computer vision and computer graphics. Recent advances in learning 3D shapes using explicit and implicit representations have achieved impressive results in 3D modeling. However, the template-based explicit representation is limited by fixed topology, and the implicit representation, although flexible with arbitrary topology, requires a large number of sampled points to regress the surface, which is computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a novel 3D shape representation named NeuralSlice, which represents a 3D shape as the intersection of a 4D tetrahedral mesh and a 4D hyperplane. A novel network is designed to incorporate the proposed representation flexibly, which learns a deformable 4D template and a parameter for slicing 4D hyperplane to reconstruct the 3D object. To learn the local deformation of the 4D template, we further propose a spatial-aware network to locate the 4D points within the 3D feature volume of input shape via positional encoding, which leverages the local geometrical feature to guide the 4D deformation. By addressing the 3D problem in a higher 4D space, our method supports flexible topology changes while being highly efficient. Our method is guaranteed to produce manifold meshes. NeuralSlice outperforms the state-of-the-art explicit-based approaches in terms of reconstruction quality. Compared with implicit approaches, by avoiding point sampling, our method is 10 times faster than the implicit approaches, and better preserves thin structures. NeuralSlice has the capability of representing various shapes and topologies using a single 4D tetrahedral mesh.},

  abstract     = {Prompt tuning for pre-trained masked language models (MLM) has shown promising performance in natural language processing tasks with few labeled examples. It tunes a prompt for the downstream task, and a verbalizer is used to bridge the predicted token and label prediction. Due to the limited training data, prompt initialization is crucial for prompt tuning. Recently, MetaPrompting (Hou et al., 2022) uses meta-learning to learn a shared initialization for all task-specific prompts. However, a single initialization is insufficient to obtain good prompts for all tasks and samples when the tasks are complex. Moreover, MetaPrompting requires tuning the whole MLM, causing a heavy burden on computation and memory as the MLM is usually large. To address these issues, we use a prompt pool to extract more task knowledge and construct instance-dependent prompts via attention. We further propose a novel soft verbalizer (RepVerb) which constructs label embedding from feature embeddings directly. Combining meta-learning the prompt pool and RepVerb, we propose MetaPrompter for effective structured prompting. MetaPrompter is parameter-efficient as only the pool is required to be tuned. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaPrompter performs better than the recent state-of-the-arts and RepVerb outperforms existing soft verbalizers.},

This paper provides a fine-grained analysis of the dynamics of GD for the matrix sensing problem, whose goal is to recover a low-rank ground-truth matrix from near-isotropic linear measurements. It is shown that GD with small initialization behaves similarly to the greedy low-rank learning heuristics (Li et al., 2020) and follows an incremental learning procedure (Gissin et al., 2019): GD sequentially learns solutions with increasing ranks until it recovers the ground truth matrix. Compared to existing works which only analyze the first learning phase for rank-1 solutions, our result provides characterizations for the whole learning process. Moreover, besides the over-parameterized regime that many prior works focused on, our analysis of the incremental learning procedure also applies to the under-parameterized regime. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to confirm our theoretical findings.},

In $\epsilon$-TS, arms are selected greedily based on empirical mean rewards with probability $1-\epsilon$, and based on posterior samples obtained from TS with probability $\epsilon$. Here, $\epsilon\in(0,1)$ is a user-defined constant. By reducing exploration, $\epsilon$-TS improves computational efficiency compared to TS while achieving better regret bounds. We establish that $\epsilon$-TS is both minimax optimal and asymptotically optimal for various popular reward distributions, including Gaussian, Bernoulli, Poisson, and Gamma. A key technical advancement in our analysis is the relaxation of the requirement for a stringent anti-concentration bound of the posterior distribution, which was necessary in recent analyses that achieved similar bounds. As a result, $\epsilon$-TS maintains the posterior update structure of TS while minimizing alterations, such as clipping the sampling distribution or solving the inverse of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between reward distributions, as done in previous work. Furthermore, our algorithm is as easy to implement as TS, but operates significantly faster due to reduced exploration. Empirical evaluations confirm the efficiency and optimality of $\epsilon$-TS.},

In this work, we cast auditing as an optimization problem, where we automatically search for input-output pairs that match a desired target behavior. For example, we might aim to find a non-toxic input that starts with "Barack Obama" that a model maps to a toxic output. This optimization problem is difficult to solve as the set of feasible points is sparse, the space is discrete, and the language models we audit are non-linear and high-dimensional. To combat these challenges, we introduce a discrete optimization algorithm, ARCA, that jointly and efficiently optimizes over inputs and outputs. Our approach automatically uncovers derogatory completions about celebrities (e.g. "Barack Obama is a legalized unborn" –$>$ "child murderer"), produces French inputs that complete to English outputs, and finds inputs that generate a specific name. Our work offers a promising new tool to uncover models' failure-modes before deployment. Content Warning: This paper contains examples that may be offensive in nature.},

However, pre-encoding memory incurs a severe quality penalty as the memory representations are not conditioned on the current input. We propose LUMEN, a hybrid between these two extremes, pre-computing the majority of the retrieval representation and completing the encoding on the fly using a live encoder that is conditioned on the question and fine-tuned for the task. We show that LUMEN significantly outperforms pure memory on multiple question-answering tasks while being much cheaper than FiD, and outperforms both for any given compute budget.

In this work, we propose a geometric version of the WL test (GWL) for discriminating geometric graphs while respecting the underlying physical symmetries: permutations, rotation, reflection, and translation. We use GWL to characterise the expressive power of geometric GNNs that are invariant or equivariant to physical symmetries in terms of distinguishing geometric graphs. GWL unpacks how key design choices influence geometric GNN expressivity: (1) Invariant layers have limited expressivity as they cannot distinguish one-hop identical geometric graphs; (2) Equivariant layers distinguish a larger class of graphs by propagating geometric information beyond local neighbourhoods; (3) Higher order tensors and scalarisation enable maximally powerful geometric GNNs; and (4) GWL's discrimination-based perspective is equivalent to universal approximation.},

As datasets grow larger, it becomes crucial to identify the examples that contribute the most to learning such representations. This enables efficient SSL by reducing the volume of data required. Nevertheless, quantifying the value of examples for SSL has remained an open question. In this work, we address this problem for the first time, by proving that examples that contribute the most to contrastive SSL are those that have the most similar augmentations to other examples, in expectation. We provide rigorous guarantees for the generalization performance of contrastive learning on such subsets. Through extensive experiments, we show that we can safely exclude 20% of examples from CIFAR100 and 40% from STL10 and TinyImageNet, without affecting downstream task performance. In general, subsets selected by our method outperform random subsets by over 3% across these datasets. Interestingly, we also discover the subsets that contribute the most to contrastive learning are those that contribute the least to supervised learning.},

  abstract     = {Compositional reinforcement learning is a promising approach for training policies to perform complex long-horizon tasks. Typically, a high-level task is decomposed into a sequence of subtasks and a separate policy is trained to perform each subtask. In this paper, we focus on the problem of training subtask policies in a way that they can be used to perform any task; here, a task is given by a sequence of subtasks. We aim to maximize the worst-case performance over all tasks as opposed to the average-case performance. We formulate the problem as a two agent zero-sum game in which the adversary picks the sequence of subtasks. The paper proposes two RL algorithms to solve this game: one is an adaptation of existing multi-agent RL algorithms to our setting and the other is an asynchronous version which enables parallel training of subtask policies.},

To resolve the issue, we propose a new calibration method to synchronize the class-wise training losses. We design a new training loss to alleviate the variance of class-wise training losses by using multiple class-wise scaling factors. The key innovation is that our framework can compensate the training losses of overfitted classes with those of under-fitted classes, the integrated training loss is preserved, preventing the performance drop even after the model calibration. Furthermore, our method can be easily employed in the post-hoc calibration methods, allowing us to use the pre-trained model as an initial model and reduce the additional computation for model calibration. We validate our approach by showing that employing it in the various post-hoc calibration methods generally improves calibration performance while preserving accuracy, and discover through investigation that our approach performs well with unbalanced datasets and untuned hyperparameters.},

To address this problem, recent studies utilize auxiliary information related to the bias, which is rarely obtainable in practice, or sift through a handful of bias-free samples for debiasing. However, the success of these methods is not always guaranteed due to the unfulfilled presumptions. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Contrastive Debiasing via Generative Bias-transformation (CDvG), which works without explicit bias labels or bias-free samples. Motivated by our observation that not only discriminative models but also image translation models tend to focus on the malignant bias, CDvG employs an image translation model to transform the bias to another mode of bias while preserving task-relevant information. Through contrastive learning, the bias-transformed views are set against each other to learn bias-invariant representations.},

This paper focuses on product catalog structure prediction, which exemplifies a number of challenges inherent to adaptive ordered clustering, referred to as the eponymous {``Catalog Problem''}. These challenges include learning variable cluster constraints, exhibiting relational reasoning and managing combinatorial complexity. Despite progress in both neural clustering and set-to-sequence methods, no joint, fully differentiable model existed at the time of publication.

These canonicalization functions can readily be plugged into non-equivariant backbone architectures. We show that this approach enjoys universality while providing interpretable insights. Our main hypothesis, supported by our empirical results, is that learning a small neural network to perform canonicalization is better than using predefined heuristics. Our experiments show that learning the canonicalization function is competitive with existing techniques for learning equivariant functions across many tasks, including image classification, $N$-body dynamics prediction, point cloud classification and part segmentation, while being faster across the board.},

A common practice is to train a predictor of the target property using the sample and apply it to both training and evaluating the generator. However, little is known about its statistical properties, making it uncertain whether this performance estimate is reliable. In this work, we theoretically investigate this evaluation methodology. We show that this evaluation methodology potentially suffers from two biases: one due to misspecification of the predictor and the other to reusing the same finite sample for training and evaluation. We discuss bias reduction methods for each of the biases comprehensively and empirically investigate their effectiveness.},

We investigate the learnability of hypothesis classes using {TV} indistinguishable learners.

For a target feature, {FALCON} captions its highly activating cropped images using a large captioning dataset (like {LAION}-400m) and a pre-trained vision-language model like {CLIP}. Each word among the captions is scored and ranked leading to a small number of shared, human-understandable concepts that closely describe the target feature. {FALCON} also applies contrastive interpretation using lowly activating (counterfactual) images, to eliminate spurious concepts. Although many existing approaches interpret features independently, we observe in state-of-the-art self-supervised and supervised models, that less than 20\% of the representation space can be explained by individual features. We show that features in larger spaces become more interpretable when studied in groups and can be explained with high-order scoring concepts through {FALCON}. We discuss how extracted concepts can be used to explain and debug failures in downstream tasks. Finally, we present a technique to transfer concepts from one (explainable) representation space to another unseen representation space by learning a simple linear transformation.},

We show that this model is identifiable from only the observed data and propose an efficient method for recovering this causal model.

  abstract     = {Symbolic regression ({SR}) is the problem of learning a symbolic expression from numerical data. Recently, deep neural models trained on procedurally-generated synthetic datasets showed competitive performance compared to more classical Genetic Programming ({GP}) ones. Unlike their {GP} counterparts, these neural approaches are trained to generate expressions from datasets given as context. This allows them to produce accurate expressions in a single forward pass at test time. However, they usually do not benefit from search abilities, which result in low performance compared to {GP} on out-of-distribution datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel method which provides the best of both worlds, based on a {Monte-Carlo Tree Search} procedure using a context-aware neural mutation model, which is initially pre-trained to learn promising mutations, and further refined from successful experiences in an online fashion. The approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the well-known {SRBench} benchmark.},

However, they are vulnerable to sophisticated attacks, e.g., {Auto-Attack}. This paper experimentally reveals that the cause of their vulnerability is their small margins between logits for the true label and the other labels. Since neural networks classify the data points based on the logits, logit margins should be large enough to avoid flipping the largest logit by the attacks. Importance-aware methods do not increase logit margins of important samples but decrease those of less-important samples compared with cross-entropy loss. To increase logit margins of important samples, we propose switching one-vs-the-rest loss ({SOVR}), which switches from cross-entropy to one-vs-the-rest loss for important samples that have small logit margins. We prove that one-vs-the-rest loss increases logit margins two times greater than cross-entropy and propose switching between cross-entropy and {OVR} by the criterion of logit margins to improve adversarial robustness.},

However, while certain pieces of information are ubiquitous on the web, others appear extremely rarely. In this work, we study the relationship between the knowledge memorized by large language models and the information in pre-training datasets scraped from the web. In particular, we show that a language model's ability to answer a fact-based question relates to how many documents associated with that question were seen during pre-training. We identify relevant documents by entity linking pre-training datasets and counting documents that contain the same entities as a given question-answer pair. Our results demonstrate strong correlational and causal relationships between accuracy and relevant document count for numerous question answering datasets (e.g., {TriviaQA}), pre-training corpora (e.g., {ROOTS}), and model sizes (e.g., 176B parameters). Moreover, while larger models are better at learning long-tail knowledge, today's models must be scaled by many orders of magnitude to reach competitive {QA} performance on questions with little support in the pre-training data. Finally, we show that retrieval-augmentation can reduce the dependence on relevant pre-training information, presenting a promising approach for capturing the long-tail.},

  abstract     = {We consider test-time adaptation (TTA), the task of adapting a trained model to an arbitrary test domain using unlabeled input data on-the-fly during testing. A common practice of TTA is to disregard data used in training due to large memory demand and privacy leakage. However, the training data are the only source of supervision. This motivates us to investigate a proper way of using them while minimizing the side effects. To this end, we propose two lightweight yet informative proxies of the training data and a TTA method fully exploiting them. One of the proxies is composed of a small number of images synthesized (hence, less privacy-sensitive) by data condensation which minimizes their domain-specificity to capture a general underlying structure over a wide spectrum of domains. Then, in TTA, they are translated into labeled test data by stylizing them to match styles of unlabeled test samples. This enables virtually supervised test-time training. The other proxy is inter-class relations of training data, which are transferred to target model during TTA. On four public benchmarks, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art ones at remarkably less computation and memory.},

  abstract     = {This study focuses on the topic of offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), a variant of conventional reinforcement learning that dispenses with the need for online interaction or specification of reward functions. Instead, the agent is provided with fixed offline trajectories and human preferences between pairs of trajectories to extract the dynamics and task information, respectively. Since the dynamics and task information are orthogonal, a naive approach would involve using preference-based reward learning followed by an off-the-shelf offline RL algorithm. However, this requires the separate learning of a scalar reward function, which is assumed to be an information bottleneck of the learning process. To address this issue, the authors propose the offline preference-guided policy optimization (OPPO) paradigm, which models offline trajectories and preferences in a one-step process, eliminating the need for separately learning a reward function. OPPO achieves this by introducing an offline hindsight information matching objective for optimizing a contextual policy and a preference modeling objective for finding the optimal context. OPPO further integrates a well-performing decision policy by optimizing the two objectives iteratively. The empirical results demonstrate that OPPO effectively models offline preferences and outperforms prior competing baselines, including offline RL algorithms performed over either true or pseudo reward function specifications.},

By developing a novel customization of dirty-label input-aware backdoors to the online setting, our attacker manages to stealthily promote forgetting while retaining high accuracy at the current task and sustaining strong defenders. Our approach taps into an intriguing property of generative models, namely that they cannot well capture input-dependent triggers.

In this paper, we model the embedding update of a node feature as a Hamiltonian orbit over time. Since the Hamiltonian orbits generalize the exponential maps, this approach allows us to learn the underlying manifold of the graph in training, in contrast to most of the existing literature that assumes a fixed graph embedding manifold with a closed exponential map solution. Our proposed node embedding strategy can automatically learn, without extensive tuning, the underlying geometry of any given graph dataset even if it has diverse geometries. We test Hamiltonian functions of different forms and verify the performance of our approach on two graph node embedding downstream tasks: node classification and link prediction. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach adapts better to different types of graph datasets than popular state-of-the-art graph node embedding GNNs.},

While some studies have reported that GR can improve generalization performance, little attention has been paid to it from the algorithmic perspective, that is, the algorithms of GR that efficiently improve the performance. In this study, we first reveal that a specific finite-difference computation, composed of both gradient ascent and descent steps, reduces the computational cost of GR. Next, we show that the finite-difference computation also works better in the sense of generalization performance. We theoretically analyze a solvable model, a diagonal linear network, and clarify that GR has a desirable implicit bias to so-called rich regime and finite-difference computation strengthens this bias. Furthermore, finite-difference GR is closely related to some other algorithms based on iterative ascent and descent steps for exploring flat minima. In particular, we reveal that the flooding method can perform finite-difference GR in an implicit way. Thus, this work broadens our understanding of GR for both practice and theory.},

  abstract     = {Thompson sampling (TS) is widely used in sequential decision making due to its ease of use and appealing empirical performance. However, many existing analytical and empirical results for TS rely on restrictive assumptions on reward distributions, such as belonging to conjugate families, which limits their applicability in realistic scenarios. Moreover, sequential decision making problems are often carried out in a batched manner, either due to the inherent nature of the problem or to serve the purpose of reducing communication and computation costs. In this work, we jointly study these problems in two popular settings, namely, stochastic multi-armed bandits (MABs) and infinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL), where TS is used to learn the unknown reward distributions and transition dynamics, respectively. We propose batched Langevin Thompson Sampling algorithms that leverage MCMC methods to sample from approximate posteriors with only logarithmic communication costs in terms of batches. Our algorithms are computationally efficient and maintain the same order-optimal regret guarantees of O(log T) for stochastic MABs, and O(sqrt(T)) for RL. We complement our theoretical findings with experimental results.},

However, we are yet to understand what explanation methods can and cannot do. How do upstream factors such as data, model prediction, hyperparameters, and random initialization influence downstream explanations? While previous work raised concerns that explanations (E) may have little relationship with the prediction (Y), there is a lack of conclusive study to quantify this relationship. Our work borrows tools from causal inference to systematically assay this relationship. More specifically, we study the relationship between E and Y by measuring the treatment effect when intervening on their causal ancestors, i.e., on hyperparameters and inputs used to generate saliency-based Es or Ys. Our results suggest that the relationships between E and Y is far from ideal. In fact, the gap between 'ideal' case only increase in higher-performing models -- models that are likely to be deployed. Our work is a promising first step towards providing a quantitative measure of the relationship between E and Y, which could also inform the future development of methods for E with a quantitative metric.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) aims to perform privacy-preserving machine learning on distributed data held by multiple data owners. To this end, FL requires the data owners to perform training locally and share the gradients or weight updates (instead of the private inputs) with the central server, which are then securely aggregated over multiple data owners. Although aggregation by itself does not offer provable privacy protection, prior work suggested that if the batch size is sufficiently large the aggregation may be secure enough. In this paper, we propose the Cocktail Party Attack (CPA) that, contrary to prior belief, is able to recover the private inputs from gradients/weight updates aggregated over as many as 1024 samples. CPA leverages the crucial insight that aggregate gradients from a fully connected (FC) layer is a linear combination of its inputs, which allows us to frame gradient inversion as a blind source separation (BSS) problem. We adapt independent component analysis (ICA)---a classic solution to the BSS problem---to recover private inputs for FC and convolutional networks, and show that CPA significantly outperforms prior gradient inversion attacks, scales to ImageNet-sized inputs, and works on large batch sizes of up to 1024.},

A multiple-timescale architecture enables the dynamic nature of the energy surface with newly introduced asymmetric synapses and signal propagation delays.},

This leads to a bias toward lower values in labels and the resultant learning because labels may have lower values due to incomplete observations, even if the actual magnitude of the phenomenon was high. Moreover, because an incomplete observation does not provide any tags indicating incompleteness, we cannot eliminate or impute them. To address this issue, we propose a learning algorithm that explicitly models incomplete observations corrupted with an asymmetric noise that always has a negative value.},

In contrast, this behavior does not appear in untrained networks in which the curvature flattens. We also show that the curvature gap between the last two layers has a strong correlation with the generalization capability of the network.

An intriguing hypothesis is that traveling waves serve to structure neural representations both in space and time, thereby acting as an inductive bias towards natural data. In this work, we investigate this hypothesis by introducing the Neural Wave Machine (NWM) -- a locally coupled oscillatory recurrent neural network capable of exhibiting traveling waves in its hidden state. After training on simple dynamic sequences, we show that this model indeed learns static spatial structure such as topographic organization, and further uses complex spatiotemporal structure such as traveling waves to encode observed transformations. To measure the computational implications of this structure, we use a suite of sequence classification and physical dynamics modeling tasks to show that the NWM is both more parameter efficient, and is able to forecast future trajectories of simple physical dynamical systems more accurately than existing state of the art counterparts.},

  abstract     = {How can agents learn internal models that veridically represent interactions with the real world is a largely open question. As machine learning is moving towards representations containing not just observational but also interventional knowledge, we study this problem using tools from representation learning and group theory. We propose methods enabling an agent acting upon the world to learn internal representations of sensory information that are consistent with actions that modify it. We use an autoencoder equipped with a group representation acting on its latent space, trained using an equivariance-derived loss in order to enforce a suitable homomorphism property on the group representation. In contrast to existing work, our approach does not require prior knowledge of the group and does not restrict the set of actions the agent can perform. The method is motivated theoretically, and empirically shown to learn a group representation of the actions, thereby capturing the structure of the set of transformations applied to the environment. We further demonstrate that this allows agents to predict the effect of sequences of future actions with improved accuracy.},

In this work, we present a different approach to the backdoor attack problem. Specifically, we show that without structural information about the training data distribution, backdoor attacks are indistinguishable from naturally-occurring features in the data--and thus impossible to detect in a general sense. We then revisit existing defenses against backdoor attacks and characterize the often latent assumptions they make and on which they depend.},

  abstract     = {Prediction sets have recently been shown to be a promising strategy for quantifying the uncertainty of deep neural networks in a way that provides theoretical guarantees. However, existing techniques have largely targeted settings where the space of labels is simple, so prediction sets can be arbitrary subsets of labels. For structured prediction problems where the space of labels is exponential in size, even prediction sets containing a small fraction of all labels can be exponentially large. In the context of code generation, we propose a solution that considers a restricted set of prediction sets that can compactly be represented as partial programs, which are programs with portions replaced with holes. Given a trained code generation model, our algorithm leverages a programming language's abstract syntax tree to generate a set of programs such that the correct program is in the set with high-confidence. Valuable applications of our algorithm include a Codex-style code generator with holes in uncertain parts of the generated code, which provides a partial program with theoretical guarantees. We evaluate our approach on PICARD (a T5 model for SQL semantic parsing) and Codex (a GPT model for over a dozen programming languages, including Python), demonstrating that our approach generates compact PAC prediction sets. This is the first research contribution that generates PAC prediction sets for generative code models.},

To fix this issue, we combine features of Accelerated Gradient Descent with the LPD method resulting in a single-loop Accelerated Linearized Primal-Dual (ALPD) method. The ALPD method achieves the optimal gradient complexity when the SPP has a semi-linear coupling function. We also present an inexact ALPD method for SPPs with a general nonlinear coupling function that maintains the optimal gradient evaluations of the primal parts and significantly improves the gradient evaluations of the coupling term compared to the ALPD method. We verify our findings with numerical experiments.},

However, imposing EL on the learning process leads to a non-convex optimization problem even if the loss function is convex, and existing fair learning algorithms cannot properly be adopted to find the fair predictor under the EL constraint. We propose the ELminimizer algorithm to find fair predictors by converting the non-convex optimization problem into a sequence of convex optimization problems that can be solved efficiently.},

In contrast, in this work, we develop an implicit gradient-based approach, which is easy to implement, and is suitable for machine learning applications. We first provide an in-depth understanding of the problem, by showing that the implicit objective for such problems is in general non-differentiable. However, if we add some small (linear) perturbation to the LL objective, the resulting implicit objective becomes differentiable almost surely. This key observation opens the door for developing (deterministic and stochastic) gradient-based algorithms similar to the state-of-the-art ones for unconstrained bi-level problems.},

CrossSplit combines two main ingredients: cross-split label correction, since the model trained on one part of the data cannot memorize example-label pairs from the other part, the training labels presented to each network can be smoothly adjusted by using the predictions of its peer network; and cross-split semi-supervised training, where a network trained on one part of the data also uses the unlabeled inputs of the other part. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet and mini-WebVision datasets demonstrate that our method can outperform the current state-of-the-art in a wide range of noise ratios.},

  abstract     = {Understanding how the dynamics in biological and artificial neural networks implement the computations required for a task is a salient open question in machine learning and neuroscience. In particular, computations requiring complex memory storage and retrieval pose a significant challenge for these networks to implement or learn. Recently, a family of models described by neural ordinary differential equations (n{ODE}s) has emerged as powerful dynamical neural network models capable of capturing complex dynamics. Here, we extend n{ODE}s by endowing them with adaptive timescales using gating interactions. We refer to these as gated neural {ODE}s (gn{ODE}s). Using a task that requires memory of continuous quantities, we demonstrate the inductive bias of the gn{ODE}s to learn (approximate) continuous attractors. We further show how reduced-dimensional gn{ODE}s retain their modeling power while greatly improving interpretability, even allowing explicit visualization of the structure of learned attractors. We introduce a novel measure of expressivity which probes the capacity of a neural network to generate complex trajectories. Using this measure, we explore how the phase-space dimension of the n{ODE}s and the complexity of the function modeling the flow field contribute to expressivity. We see that a more complex function for modeling the flow field allows a lower-dimensional n{ODE} to capture a given target dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate the benefit of gating in n{ODE}s on several real-world tasks.},

Such an assumption hinders the autonomous learning of embodied agents due to the time-consuming and cumbersome workarounds for resetting in the physical world. Hence, there has been a growing interest in autonomous {RL} ({ARL}) methods that are capable of learning from non-episodic interactions. However, existing works on {ARL} are limited by their reliance on prior data and are unable to learn in environments where task-relevant interactions are sparse. In contrast, we propose a demonstration-free {ARL} algorithm via Implicit and Bi-directional Curriculum ({IBC}). With an auxiliary agent that is conditionally activated upon learning progress and a bidirectional goal curriculum based on optimal transport, our method outperforms previous methods, even the ones that leverage demonstrations.},

We establish a new estimator which guarantees a faster convergence rate, and consequently, a lower regret in such problems. We propose a bandit policy that is a closed-form function of said estimated parameters. When the contexts are non-degenerate, the regret of the proposed policy is sublinear in the context dimension, the number of classes, and the time horizon $T$ when the budget grows at least as $\sqrt{T}$. We also resolve an open problem posed by Agrawal \& Devanur (2016) and extend the result to a multi-class setting.

  abstract     = {Recent works on neural network pruning advocate that reducing the depth of the network is more effective in reducing run-time memory usage and accelerating inference latency than reducing the width of the network through channel pruning. In this regard, some recent works propose depth compression algorithms that merge convolution layers. However, the existing algorithms have a constricted search space and rely on human-engineered heuristics. In this paper, we propose a novel depth compression algorithm which targets general convolution operations. We propose a subset selection problem that replaces inefficient activation layers with identity functions and optimally merges consecutive convolution operations into shallow equivalent convolution operations for efficient end-to-end inference latency. Since the proposed subset selection problem is {NP}-hard, we formulate a surrogate optimization problem that can be solved exactly via two-stage dynamic programming within a few seconds. We evaluate our methods and baselines by {TensorRT} for a fair inference latency comparison. Our method outperforms the baseline method with higher accuracy and faster inference speed in {MobileNetV2} on the {ImageNet} dataset. Specifically, we achieve $1.41\times$ speed-up with $0.11$\%p accuracy gain in {MobileNetV2}-1.0 on the {ImageNet}.},

Representatively, Concept Bottleneck Models ({CBM}) follow a two-step process of concept prediction and class prediction based on the predicted concepts. {CBM} provides explanations with high-level concepts derived from concept predictions; thus, reliable concept predictions are important for trustworthiness. In this study, we address the ambiguity issue that can harm reliability. While the existence of a concept can often be ambiguous in the data, {CBM} predicts concepts deterministically without considering this ambiguity. To provide a reliable interpretation against this ambiguity, we propose Probabilistic Concept Bottleneck Models ({ProbCBM}). By leveraging probabilistic concept embeddings, {ProbCBM} models uncertainty in concept prediction and provides explanations based on the concept and its corresponding uncertainty. This uncertainty enhances the reliability of the explanations. Furthermore, as class uncertainty is derived from concept uncertainty in {ProbCBM}, we can explain class uncertainty by means of concept uncertainty.},

We apply {DevFormer} to the problem of decoupling capacitor placement and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both simulated and real hardware, leading to improved performances while reducing the number of components by more than 30\%.

Instead, we train the discriminator after score training, making discriminator training stable and fast to converge.

Recent research on non-linear, deep learning-based coding schemes have demonstrated significant improvements in communication reliability over linear codes, but are still vulnerable to the presence of forward and feedback noise over the channel. In this paper, we develop a new family of non-linear feedback codes that greatly enhance robustness to channel noise. Our autoencoder-based architecture is designed to learn codes based on consecutive blocks of bits, which obtains de-noising advantages over bit-by-bit processing to help overcome the physical separation between the encoder and decoder over a noisy channel. Moreover, we develop a power control layer at the encoder to explicitly incorporate hardware constraints into the learning optimization, and prove that the resulting average power constraint is satisfied asymptotically. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art feedback codes by wide margins over practical forward and feedback noise regimes, and provide information-theoretic insights on the behavior of our non-linear codes. Moreover, we observe that, in a long blocklength regime, canonical error correction codes are still preferable to feedback codes when the feedback noise becomes high.},

However, it often leads to a memory imbalance problem, where certain {GPU}s face high memory pressure while others underutilize their capacity. This imbalance results in suboptimal training performance, even when the overall {GPU} memory capacity is sufficient for more efficient setups. To address this problem, we propose {BPipe}, a novel approach for achieving memory balance in pipeline parallelism. {BPipe} employs an activation balancing method to transfer intermediate activations between {GPU}s during training, enabling all {GPU}s to utilize comparable amounts of memory. With balanced memory utilization, {BPipe} enhances the training efficiency of large language models by eliminating redundant recomputations or increasing the micro-batch size. Our evaluation on 48 A100 {GPU}s across six nodes interconnected with {HDR} {InfiniBand} shows that {BPipe} accelerates the training of {GPT}-3 96B and {GPT}-3 134B models by 1.25x--2.17x compared to {Megatron}-{LM}, a state-of-the-art framework for training large language models.},

  abstract     = {Multivariate time series data for real-world applications typically contain a significant amount of missing values. The dominant approach for classification with such missing values is to impute them heuristically with specific values (zero, mean, values of adjacent time-steps) or learnable parameters. However, these simple strategies do not take the data generative process into account, and more importantly, do not effectively capture the uncertainty in prediction due to the multiple possibilities for the missing values. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic framework for classification with multivariate time series data with missing values. Our model consists of two parts; a deep generative model for missing value imputation and a classifier. Extending the existing deep generative models to better capture structures of time-series data, our deep generative model part is trained to impute the missing values in multiple plausible ways, effectively modeling the uncertainty of the imputation. The classifier part takes the time series data along with the imputed missing values and classifies signals, and is trained to capture the predictive uncertainty due to the multiple possibilities of imputations. Importantly, we show that naïvely combining the generative model and the classifier could result in trivial solutions where the generative model does not produce meaningful imputations. To resolve this, we present a novel regularization technique that can promote the model to produce useful imputation values that help classification. Through extensive experiments on real-world time series data with missing values, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

However, learning complex skills is still challenging, due to the fact that the order of training skills can largely affect sample efficiency. Inspired by this, we recast variational empowerment as curriculum learning in goal-conditioned RL with an intrinsic reward function, which we name Variational Curriculum RL (VCRL). From this perspective, we propose a novel approach to unsupervised skill discovery based on information theory, called Value Uncertainty Variational Curriculum (VUVC). We prove that, under regularity conditions, VUVC accelerates the increase of entropy in the visited states compared to the uniform curriculum. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on complex navigation and robotic manipulation tasks in terms of sample efficiency and state coverage speed. We also demonstrate that the skills discovered by our method successfully complete a real-world robot navigation task in a zero-shot setup and that incorporating these skills with a global planner further increases the performance.},

However, if some or all of these symmetries are only approximate, which frequently happens in practice, these models may be suboptimal due to the architectural restrictions imposed on them. We tackle this issue of approximate symmetries in a setup where symmetries are mixed, i.e., they are symmetries of not single but multiple different types and the degree of approximation varies across these types. Instead of proposing a new architectural restriction as in most of the previous approaches, we present a regularizer-based method for building a model for a dataset with mixed approximate symmetries. The key component of our method is what we call equivariance regularizer for a given type of symmetries, which measures how much a model is equivariant with respect to the symmetries of the type. Our method is trained with these regularizers, one per each symmetry type, and the strength of the regularizers is automatically tuned during training, leading to the discovery of the approximation levels of some candidate symmetry types without explicit supervision. Using synthetic function approximation and motion forecasting tasks, we demonstrate that our method achieves better accuracy than prior approaches while discovering the approximate symmetry levels correctly.},

To address these issues, we present a framework that identifies candidate prognostic genes by integrating representation learning and statistical analysis approaches. Specifically, we propose a collaborative filtering-derived mechanism to represent patients in order of their survival risk, facilitating their dichotomization. We also propose a mechanism that allows embedded gene vectors to be polarized on the extremities of, or centered on, both reference axes to facilitate recommendations. Restricting our analysis to a few representative genes within each cluster allowed for the efficient identification of prognostic genes.

  abstract     = {Recent instruction-following datasets and evaluations have made great strides in improving language model performance on helpfulness. However, collecting new additional input-output pairs is often too costly and challenging, particularly considering their marginal impact on improving the current model accuracy. Instead, additional or complementary annotations on the existing input texts in the benchmarks can be preferable as an efficient way to pay the additional human cost. Motivated by this, we propose P2C (Prefer to Classify), a multi-task learning framework that jointly learns (1) a target task (e.g., sentiment classification) and (2) a preference between two samples for the given task label (e.g., positive or negative). From the pair-wise comparison, P2C captures the finer task information which can't be captured in a sample-wise evaluation. Our experimental results on six text classification datasets show that P2C outperforms the baseline methods and achieves comparable performance with methods using 2x or 5x more annotations.},

In this work, we show that BBVI satisfies a matching bound corresponding to the ABC condition used in the SGD literature when applied to smooth and quadratically-growing log-likelihoods. Our results generalize to nonlinear covariance parameterizations widely used in the practice of BBVI. Furthermore, we show that the variance of the mean-field parameterization has provably superior dimensional dependence.},

As a special case, our new simple momentum algorithm, called the unified AGM, seamlessly bridges the gap between the two most popular forms of Nesterov's AGM and has a superior convergence guarantee compared to existing algorithms for non-strongly convex objective functions.},

Instead we formulate the addition of documents as a constrained optimization problem that makes minimal changes to the network parameters.

In this paper, we consider to use the integral probability metric (IPM), which is a metric between two probability measures, for covariate balancing. We prove that the corresponding estimator can be consistent without correctly specifying any model and empirically show that our proposed method outperforms existing weighting methods with large margins for finite samples.},

Although several techniques have achieved learning with no CF, they attain it by letting each task monopolize a sub-network in a shared network, which seriously limits knowledge transfer (KT) and causes over-consumption of the network capacity. The goal of this paper is threefold: (1) overcoming CF, (2) encouraging KT, and (3) tackling the capacity problem. A novel technique (called SPG) is proposed that soft-masks (partially blocks) parameter updating in training based on the importance of each parameter to old tasks. Each task still uses the full network, enabling maximum KT and reduction in capacity usage.},

We benchmark five objectives for pretraining with human feedback across three tasks and find a Pareto-optimal and simple approach: conditional training, or learning distribution over tokens conditional on their human preference scores. Conditional training reduces the rate of undesirable content by up to an order of magnitude and maintains downstream task performance.},

  abstract     = {Neural architectures that learn potential energy surfaces from molecular data have undergone fast improvement in recent years. A key driver of this success is the Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) paradigm. Its favorable scaling with system size partly relies upon a spatial distance limit on messages. While this focus on locality is a useful inductive bias, it also impedes the learning of long-range interactions such as electrostatics and van der Waals forces. To address this drawback, we propose Ewald message passing: a nonlocal Fourier space scheme which limits interactions via a cutoff on frequency instead of distance, and is theoretically well-founded in the Ewald summation method. It can serve as an augmentation on top of existing MPNN architectures as it is computationally inexpensive and agnostic to architectural details. We test the approach with four baseline models and two datasets containing diverse periodic (OC20) and aperiodic structures (OE62). Across all models and datasets, we observe robust improvements in energy mean absolute errors, averaging 10\% on OC20 and 16\% on OE62. Our analysis shows an outsize impact of these improvements on structures with high long-range contributions to the ground-truth energy.},

Being the most prevalent in the computer vision community, diffusion models have also recently gained some attention in other domains, including speech, NLP, and graph-like data. In this work, we investigate if the framework of diffusion models can be advantageous for general tabular problems, where datapoints are typically represented by vectors of heterogeneous features. The inherent heterogeneity of tabular data makes it quite challenging for accurate modeling, since the individual features can be of completely different nature, i.e., some of them can be continuous and some of them can be discrete. To address such data types, we introduce TabDDPM -- a diffusion model that can be universally applied to any tabular dataset and handles any type of feature. We extensively evaluate TabDDPM on a wide set of benchmarks and demonstrate its superiority over existing GAN/VAE alternatives, which is consistent with the advantage of diffusion models in other fields. Additionally, we show that TabDDPM is eligible for privacy-oriented setups, where the original datapoints cannot be publicly shared.},

Recently, a few studies have attempted to theoretically understand benign overfitting in neural networks. However, these works are either limited to neural networks with smooth activation functions or to the neural tangent kernel regime. How and when benign overfitting can occur in ReLU neural networks remains an open problem. In this work, we seek to answer this question by establishing algorithm-dependent risk bounds for learning two-layer ReLU convolutional neural networks with label-flipping noise. We show that, under mild conditions, the neural network trained by gradient descent can achieve near-zero training loss and Bayes optimal test risk. Our result also reveals a sharp transition between benign and harmful overfitting under different conditions on data distribution in terms of test risk.},

VaMoH combines the capabilities of modeling continuous functions using INRs and the inference capabilities of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In addition, VaMoH relies on a normalizing flow to define the prior, and a mixture of hypernetworks to parametrize the data log-likelihood. This gives VaMoH a high expressive capability and interpretability. Through experiments on a diverse range of data types, such as images, voxels, and climate data, we show that VaMoH can effectively learn rich distributions over continuous functions.},

Here, we find a quantity that does decrease monotonically throughout GD training: the sharpness attained by the gradient flow solution (GFS)--the solution that would be obtained if, from now until convergence, we train with an infinitesimal step size. Theoretically, we analyze scalar neural networks with the squared loss, perhaps the simplest setting where the EoS phenomena still occur. In this model, we prove that the GFS sharpness decreases monotonically. Using this result, we characterize settings where GD provably converges to the EoS in scalar networks. Empirically, we show that GD monotonically decreases the GFS sharpness in a squared regression model as well as practical neural network architectures.},

  abstract     = {Moment restrictions and their conditional counterparts emerge in many areas of machine learning and statistics ranging from causal inference to reinforcement learning. Estimators for these tasks, generally called methods of moments, include the prominent generalized method of moments (GMM) which has recently gained attention in causal inference. GMM is a special case of the broader family of empirical likelihood estimators which are based on approximating a population distribution by means of minimizing a $\phi$-divergence to an empirical distribution. However, the use of $\phi$-divergences effectively limits the candidate distributions to reweightings of the data samples. We lift this long-standing limitation and provide a method of moments that goes beyond data reweighting. This is achieved by defining an empirical likelihood estimator based on maximum mean discrepancy which we term the kernel method of moments (KMM). We provide a variant of our estimator for conditional moment restrictions and show that it is asymptotically first-order optimal for such problems. Finally, we show that our method achieves competitive performance on several conditional moment restriction tasks.},

One important aspect of the problem, that can significantly impact quality, is the distribution skew among tasks. Certain tasks may have much fewer data samples than others, making them more susceptible to the noise added for privacy. It is natural to ask whether algorithms can adapt to this skew to improve the overall utility. We give a systematic analysis of the problem, by studying how to optimally allocate a user's privacy budget among tasks. We propose a generic algorithm, based on an adaptive reweighting of the empirical loss, and show that when there is task distribution skew, this gives a quantifiable improvement of excess empirical risk.},

Intuitively, enforcing the right to be forgotten may trigger model updates which in turn invalidate previously provided explanations, thus violating the right to explanation. In this work, we investigate the technical implications arising due to the interference between the two aforementioned regulatory principles, and propose the first algorithmic framework to resolve the tension between them.},

We investigate the training dynamics of large-graph GNNs using graph neural tangent kernels (GNTKs) and graphons. In the limit of large width, optimization of an overparametrized NN is equivalent to kernel regression on the NTK. Here, we investigate how the GNTK evolves as another independent dimension is varied: the graph size. We use graphons to define limit objects -- graphon NNs for GNNs, and graphon NTKs for GNTKs, and prove that, on a sequence of growing graphs, the GNTKs converge to the graphon NTK. We further prove that the eigenspaces of the GNTK, which are related to the problem learning directions and associated learning speeds, converge to the spectrum of the GNTK.},

Prior works consider forward approaches that learn surrogates to the black-box function and inverse approaches that directly map function values to corresponding points in the input domain of the black-box function. These approaches are limited by the quality of the offline dataset and the difficulty in learning one-to-many mappings in high dimensions, respectively. We propose Denoising Diffusion Optimization Models (DDOM), a new inverse approach for offline black-box optimization based on diffusion models. Given an offline dataset, DDOM learns a conditional generative model over the domain of the black-box function conditioned on the function values. We investigate several design choices in DDOM, such as reweighting the dataset to focus on high function values and the use of classifier-free guidance at test-time to enable generalization to function values that can even exceed the dataset maxima. Empirically, we conduct experiments on the Design-Bench benchmark (Trabucco et al., 2022) and show that DDOM achieves results competitive with state-of-the-art baselines.},

In this work, we propose a method for generating from simulation data a dataset on which a system can be trained via supervised learning to design circuits to meet threshold specifications. We moreover perform the to-date most extensive evaluation of automated analog circuit design, including experimenting in a significantly more diverse set of circuits than in prior work, covering linear, nonlinear, and autonomous circuit configurations, and show that our method consistently reaches success rate better than 90\% at 5\% error margin, while also improving data efficiency by upward of an order of magnitude.},

We extensively evaluate our QEMRL algorithm on a variety of Atari and Mujoco benchmark tasks and demonstrate that QEMRL achieves significant improvement over baseline algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and convergence performance.},

We build a vector-quantized generative model for the identified subgoals to perform subgoal-level planning. In experiments, the algorithm excels at solving complex, long-horizon decision-making problems outperforming state-of-the-art. Because of its ability to plan, our algorithm can find better trajectories than the ones in the training set.},

To drive the reverse diffusion process, we use a fully-convolutional light-weight denoiser, which is conditioned on both the noise level and the scale. This architecture allows generating samples of arbitrary dimensions, in a coarse-to-fine manner. As we illustrate, SinDDM generates diverse high-quality samples, and is applicable in a wide array of tasks, including style transfer and harmonization. Furthermore, it can be easily guided by external supervision. Particularly, we demonstrate text-guided generation from a single image using a pre-trained CLIP model.},

Thus, understanding distribution shifts is critical for examining and hopefully mitigating the effect of such a shift. Most prior work has focused on merely detecting if a shift has occurred and assumes any detected shift can be understood and handled appropriately by a human operator. We hope to aid in these manual mitigation tasks by explaining the distribution shift using interpretable transportation maps from the original distribution to the shifted one. We derive our interpretable mappings from a relaxation of the optimal transport problem, where the candidate mappings are restricted to a set of interpretable mappings. We then use a wide array of quintessential examples of distribution shift in real-world tabular, text, and image cases to showcase how our explanatory mappings provide a better balance between detail and interpretability than baseline explanations by both visual inspection and our PercentExplained metric.},

However, many real-world graphs also have features or contexts associated with each node. The existing graph coarsening methods do not consider the node features and rely solely on a graph matrix (e.g., adjacency and Laplacian) to coarsen graphs. However, some recent deep learning-based graph coarsening methods are designed for specific tasks considering both node features and graph matrix. In this paper, we introduce a novel optimization-based framework for graph coarsening that takes both the graph matrix and the node features as the input and jointly learns the coarsened graph matrix and the coarsened feature matrix while ensuring desired properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that guarantees that the learned coarsened graph is $\epsilon\in[0,1)$ similar to the original graph. Extensive experiments with both real and synthetic benchmark datasets elucidate the proposed framework's efficacy and applicability for numerous graph-based applications, including graph clustering, node classification, stochastic block model identification, and graph summarization.},

This partial observability poses a challenge to existing link prediction approaches, which we address. We propose a novel state representation -- Scene Graph Memory (SGM) -- with captures the agent's accumulated set of observations, as well as a neural net architecture called a Node Edge Predictor (NEP) that extracts information from the SGM to search efficiently. We evaluate our method in the Dynamic House Simulator, a new benchmark that creates diverse dynamic graphs following the semantic patterns typically seen at homes, and show that NEP can be trained to predict the locations of objects in a variety of environments with diverse object movement dynamics, outperforming baselines both in terms of new scene adaptability and overall accuracy.

Despite incurring no additional latency at test time, data augmentation often requires more epochs of training to be effective. For example, even the simple flips-and-crops augmentation requires training for more than 5 epochs to improve performance, whereas RandAugment requires more than 90 epochs. We propose a general framework called Tied-Augment, which improves the efficacy of data augmentation in a wide range of applications by adding a simple term to the loss that can control the similarity of representations under distortions. Tied-Augment can improve state-of-the-art methods from data augmentation (e.g. RandAugment, mixup), optimization (e.g. SAM), and semi-supervised learning (e.g. FixMatch). For example, Tied-RandAugment can outperform RandAugment by 2.0\% on ImageNet. Notably, using Tied-Augment, data augmentation can be made to improve generalization even when training for a few epochs and when fine-tuning.

These results hold for a range of different VAE architectures on the MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. In this work, we also demonstrate that increasing the number of mixture components improves the latent-representation capabilities of the VAE on both image and single-cell datasets. This cooperative behavior motivates that using Mixture VAEs should be considered a standard approach for obtaining more flexible variational approximations. Finally, Mixture VAEs are here, for the first time, compared and combined with normalizing flows, hierarchical models and/or the VampPrior in an extensive ablation study.

HEAT complements prior density estimators of the ID density, e.g. parametric models like the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), to provide an accurate yet robust density estimation. A second contribution is to leverage the EBM framework to provide a unified density estimation and to compose several energy terms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significance of the two contributions. HEAT sets new state-of-the-art OOD detection results on the CIFAR-10 / CIFAR-100 benchmark as well as on the large-scale Imagenet benchmark.},

First, we illustrate critical points of the theory and the importance of various assumptions.

Second, our automatic evaluation is highly specific (reliable) -- across all Codex-002-predicted solutions that our evaluation accept, only 1.8\% of them are incorrect; we achieve this with multi-criteria metrics, checking both functional correctness by running test cases and surface-form constraints by restricting API usages or keywords. Finally, we proactively defend against memorization by slightly modifying our problems to be different from the original StackOverflow source; consequently, models cannot answer them correctly by memorizing the solutions from pre-training.},

The advent of probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) frees users from writing inference algorithms and lets users focus on modeling. However, many models are difficult for HMC to solve directly, and often require tricks like model reparameterization. We are motivated by the fact that many of those models could be simplified by marginalization. We propose to use automatic marginalization as part of the sampling process using HMC in a graphical model extracted from a PPL, which substantially improves sampling from real-world hierarchical models.},

Recent works have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can improve human performance in chip placement. However, such an RL-based approach suffers from long training time and low transfer ability in unseen chip circuits. To resolve these challenges, we cast the chip placement as an offline RL formulation and present ChiPFormer that enables learning a transferable placement policy from fixed offline data. ChiPFormer has several advantages that prior arts do not have. First, ChiPFormer can exploit offline placement designs to learn transferable policies more efficiently in a multi-task setting. Second, ChiPFormer can promote effective finetuning for unseen chip circuits, reducing the placement runtime from hours to minutes. Third, extensive experiments on 32 chip circuits demonstrate that ChiPFormer achieves significantly better placement quality while reducing the runtime by 10x compared to recent state-of-the-art approaches in both public benchmarks and realistic industrial tasks.},

These perturbed data densities are linked together by the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE), a partial differential equation (PDE) governing the spatial-temporal evolution of a density undergoing a diffusion process. In this work, we derive a corresponding equation called the score FPE that characterizes the noise-conditional scores of the perturbed data densities (i.e., their gradients). Surprisingly, despite the impressive empirical performance, we observe that scores learned through denoising score matching (DSM) fail to fulfill the underlying score FPE, which is an inherent self-consistency property of the ground truth score. We prove that satisfying the score FPE is desirable as it improves the likelihood and the degree of conservativity. Hence, we propose to regularize the DSM objective to enforce satisfaction of the score FPE, and we show the effectiveness of this approach across various datasets.},

In particular, we show that with a recent "cheap" bootstrap perspective, using a number of resamples as small as one could attain valid coverage even when the dimension grows closely with the sample size, thus strongly supporting the implementability of the bootstrap for large-scale problems.

To avoid potentially ad hoc choices of losses, statistical decision theory describes a desirable property for losses known as properness, which asserts that Bayes' rule is optimal. Recent works have sought to learn losses and models jointly. Existing methods do this by fitting an inverse canonical link function which monotonically maps ℝ to [0,1] to estimate probabilities for binary problems. In this paper, we extend monotonicity to maps between ℝ^(C-1) and the projected probability simplex Δ̃^(C-1) by using monotonicity of gradients of convex functions. We present LegendreTron as a novel and practical method that jointly learns proper canonical losses and probabilities for multiclass problems.},

In this paper, we propose the use of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) tailored to leverage auxiliary structural information about contig relations when learning contig representations for subsequent metagenomic binning. Our method, CCVAE, improves on previous work that used VAEs for learning latent representations of the individual contigs, by constraining these representations according to the connectivity information from the assembly graph, and incorporates into the model additional information in the form of marker genes to better differentiate contigs from different genomes.},

  abstract     = {In reinforcement learning ({RL}), state representations are key to dealing with large or continuous state spaces. While one of the promises of deep learning algorithms is to automatically construct features well-tuned for the task they try to solve, such a representation might not emerge from end-to-end training of deep {RL} agents. To mitigate this issue, auxiliary objectives are often incorporated into the learning process and help shape the learnt state representation. Bootstrapping methods are today's method of choice to make these additional predictions. Yet, it is unclear which features these algorithms capture and how they relate to those from other auxiliary-task-based approaches. In this paper, the authors address this gap and provide a theoretical characterization of the state representation learnt by temporal difference learning. Surprisingly, they find that this representation differs from the features learned by Monte Carlo and residual gradient algorithms for most transition structures of the environment in the policy evaluation setting. They describe the efficacy of these representations for policy evaluation, and use their theoretical analysis to design new auxiliary learning rules. The authors complement their theoretical results with an empirical comparison of these learning rules for different cumulant functions on classic domains such as the four-room domain and Mountain Car.},

In this paper we establish the existence of highly sparse trainable initializations for evolution strategies ({ES}) and characterize qualitative differences compared to gradient descent ({GD})-based sparse training. We introduce a novel signal-to-noise iterative pruning procedure, which incorporates loss curvature information into the network pruning step. This can enable the discovery of even sparser trainable network initializations when using black-box evolution as compared to {GD}-based optimization. Furthermore, we find that these initializations encode an inductive bias, which transfers across different {ES}, related tasks and even to {GD}-based training. Finally, we compare the local optima resulting from the different optimization paradigms and sparsity levels. In contrast to {GD}, {ES} explore diverse and flat local optima and do not preserve linear mode connectivity across sparsity levels and independent runs. The results highlight qualitative differences between evolution and gradient-based learning dynamics, which can be uncovered by the study of iterative pruning procedures.},

For decades, {RL} books have been reporting the occupancy equivalence between Markovian and non-Markovian policies in countable state-action spaces under mild conditions. This equivalence states that the occupancy of any non-Markovian policy can be equivalently obtained by a Markovian policy, i.e. a memoryless probability distribution, conditioned only on its current state. While expected, for technical reasons, the translation of this result to continuous state space has resisted until now. Our main contribution is to fill this gap and to provide a general measure-theoretic treatment of the problem, permitting, in particular, its extension to continuous {MDP}s. Furthermore, we show that when the occupancy is infinite, we may encounter some non-trivial cases where the result does not hold anymore.},

We show that there is a well-defined dichotomy between strategically relevant and irrelevant information. Moreover, we show that, in dynamic games, this dichotomy has a compact representation that can be efficiently computed via a Bellman backup operator. We apply this algorithm to analyze the strategically relevant information for tasks in both a standard and a partially observable version of the Overcooked environment. Theoretical and empirical results show that our algorithms are significantly more efficient than baselines.},

Such functions are prevalent in reinforcement learning, imitation learning and adversarial training. Our target optimization framework uses the (expensive) gradient computation to construct surrogate functions in a target space (e.g. the logits output by a linear model for classification) that can be minimized efficiently. This allows for multiple parameter updates to the model, amortizing the cost of gradient computation. In the full-batch setting, we prove that our surrogate is a global upper-bound on the loss, and can be (locally) minimized using a black-box optimization algorithm. We prove that the resulting majorization-minimization algorithm ensures convergence to a stationary point of the loss. Next, we instantiate our framework in the stochastic setting and propose the {SSO} algorithm, which can be viewed as projected stochastic gradient descent in the target space. This connection enables us to prove theoretical guarantees for {SSO} when minimizing convex functions. Our framework allows the use of standard stochastic optimization algorithms to construct surrogates which can be minimized by any deterministic optimization method. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of supervised learning and imitation learning problems. Our experiments indicate the benefits of target optimization and the effectiveness of {SSO}.},

Traditional clustering algorithms provide limited insight into the groups they find as their main focus is accuracy and not the interpretability of the group assignments. This has spurred a recent line of work on explainable machine learning for clustering. In this paper we focus on the cluster description problem where, given a dataset and its partition into clusters, the task is to explain the clusters. We introduce a new approach to explain clusters by constructing polyhedra around each cluster while minimizing either the complexity of the resulting polyhedra or the number of features used in the description. We formulate the cluster description problem as an integer program and present a column generation approach to search over an exponential number of candidate half-spaces that can be used to build the polyhedra. To deal with large datasets, we introduce a novel grouping scheme that first forms smaller groups of data points and then builds the polyhedra around the grouped data, a strategy which out-performs simply sub-sampling data. Compared to state of the art cluster description algorithms, our approach is able to achieve competitive interpretability with improved description accuracy.},

Different methods have been proposed to reduce this gap, but most of them require architectural changes in {ST} training. In this work, we propose to mitigate this issue at the pre-training stage, requiring no change in the {ST} model. First, we show that the connectionist temporal classification ({CTC}) loss can reduce the modality gap by design. We provide a quantitative comparison with the more common cross-entropy loss, showing that pre-training with {CTC} consistently achieves better final {ST} accuracy. Nevertheless, {CTC} is only a partial solution and thus, in our second contribution, we propose a novel pre-training method combining {CTC} and optimal transport to further reduce this gap. Our method pre-trains a Siamese-like model composed of two encoders, one for acoustic inputs and the other for textual inputs, such that they produce representations that are close to each other in the Wasserstein space. Extensive experiments on the standard CoVoST-2 and MuST-C datasets show that our pre-training method applied to the vanilla encoder-decoder Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance under the no-external-data setting, and performs on par with recent strong multi-task learning systems trained with external data. Finally, our method can also be applied on top of these multi-task systems, leading to further improvements for these models.},

We propose a novel batch-learning setting in which we use unlabeled data from previous rounds to estimate the manipulation structure. We show that it is possible to learn a close-to-optimal classifier in terms of strategic loss, even without prior knowledge of feasible manipulations.

AERO-GNN provably mitigates the proposed problems of deep graph attention, which is further empirically demonstrated with its adaptive and less smooth attention functions and higher performance at deep layers (up to 64).

In this paper, we propose an INductive knowledge GRAph eMbedding method, InGram, that can generate embeddings of new relations as well as new entities at inference time. Given a knowledge graph, we define a relation graph as a weighted graph consisting of relations and the affinity weights between them. Based on the relation graph and the original knowledge graph, InGram learns how to aggregate neighboring embeddings to generate relation and entity embeddings using an attention mechanism. Experimental results show that InGram outperforms 14 different state-of-the-art methods on varied inductive learning scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem, a randomized probability matching policy called Thompson sampling (TS) has shown excellent performance in various reward models. In addition to the empirical performance, TS has been shown to achieve asymptotic problem-dependent lower bounds in several models. However, its optimality has been mainly addressed under light-tailed or one-parameter models that belong to exponential families. In this paper, we consider the optimality of TS for the Pareto model that has a heavy tail and is parameterized by two unknown parameters. Specifically, we discuss the optimality of TS with probability matching priors that include the Jeffreys prior and the reference priors. We first prove that TS with certain probability matching priors can achieve the optimal regret bound. Then, we show the suboptimality of TS with other priors, including the Jeffreys and the reference priors. We also show that TS with the Jeffreys and reference priors can achieve the asymptotic lower bound if one uses a truncation procedure.},

  abstract     = {Molecular relational learning, whose goal is to learn the interaction behavior between molecular pairs, got a surge of interest in molecular sciences due to its wide range of applications. Recently, graph neural networks have shown great success in molecular relational learning by modeling a molecule as a graph structure, and considering atom-level interactions between two molecules. Despite their success, existing molecular relational learning methods tend to overlook the nature of chemistry, i.e., a chemical compound is composed of multiple substructures such as functional groups that cause distinctive chemical reactions. In this work, we propose a novel relational learning framework, called CGIB, that predicts the interaction behavior between a pair of graphs by detecting core subgraphs therein. The main idea is, given a pair of graphs, to find a subgraph from a graph that contains the minimal sufficient information regarding the task at hand conditioned on the paired graph based on the principle of conditional graph information bottleneck. We argue that our proposed method mimics the nature of chemical reactions, i.e., the core substructure of a molecule varies depending on which other molecule it interacts with. Extensive experiments on various tasks with real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of CGIB over state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {A well-known limitation of existing molecular generative models is that the generated molecules highly resemble those in the training set. To generate truly novel molecules with completely different structures that may have even better properties than known molecules for de novo drug discovery, more powerful exploration in the chemical space is necessary. To this end, we propose Molecular Out-Of-distribution Diffusion (MOOD), a score-based diffusion scheme that incorporates out-of-distribution (OOD) control in the generative stochastic differential equation (SDE) with simple control of a hyperparameter, thus requires no additional costs. Since some novel molecules may not meet the basic requirements of real-world drugs, MOOD performs conditional generation by utilizing the gradients from a property predictor that guides the reverse-time diffusion process to high-scoring regions according to target properties such as protein-ligand interactions, drug-likeness, and synthesizability. This allows MOOD to search for novel and meaningful molecules rather than generating unseen yet trivial ones. We experimentally validate that MOOD is able to explore the chemical space beyond the training distribution, generating molecules that outscore ones found with existing methods, and even the top 0.01% of the original training pool.},

Perhaps due to this diversity, previous work has typically relied on domain-specific recipes with limited sharing of the underlying data, model architectures, and objectives. We present Pix2Struct, a pretrained image-to-text model for purely visual language understanding, which can be finetuned on tasks containing visually-situated language. Pix2Struct is pretrained by learning to parse masked screenshots of web pages into simplified HTML. The web, with its richness of visual elements cleanly reflected in the HTML structure, provides a large source of pretraining data well suited to the diversity of downstream tasks. Intuitively, this objective subsumes common pretraining signals such as OCR, language modeling, image captioning. In addition to the novel pretraining strategy, we introduce a variable-resolution input representation and a more flexible integration of language and vision inputs, where language prompts such as questions are rendered directly on top of the input image. For the first time, we show that a single pretrained model can achieve state-of-the-art results in six out of nine tasks across four domains: documents, illustrations, user interfaces, and natural images.},

  abstract     = {Post-training quantization (PTQ) has been gaining popularity for the deployment of deep neural networks on resource-limited devices since unlike quantization-aware training, neither a full training dataset nor end-to-end training is required at all. As PTQ schemes based on reconstructing each layer or block output turn out to be effective to enhance quantized model performance, recent works have developed algorithms to devise and learn a new weight-rounding scheme so as to better reconstruct each layer or block output. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective new weight-rounding mechanism for PTQ, coined FlexRound, based on element-wise division instead of typical element-wise addition such that FlexRound enables jointly learning a common quantization grid size as well as a different scale for each pre-trained weight. Thanks to the reciprocal rule of derivatives induced by element-wise division, FlexRound is inherently able to exploit pre-trained weights when updating their corresponding scales, and thus, flexibly quantize pre-trained weights depending on their magnitudes. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to carry out comprehensive experiments on not only image classification and natural language understanding but also natural language generation. Moreover, we demonstrate, for the first time, that large language models can be efficiently quantized, with only a negligible impact on performance compared to half-precision baselines.},

Even though these models show impressive performance on large-scale datasets, numerical simulation requires multiple evaluations of a neural network, leading to a slow sampling speed. We attribute the reason to the high curvature of the learned generative trajectories, as it is directly related to the truncation error of a numerical solver. Based on the relationship between the forward process and the curvature, here we present an efficient method of training the forward process to minimize the curvature of generative trajectories without any {ODE}/{SDE} simulation. Experiments show that our method achieves a lower curvature than previous models and, therefore, decreased sampling costs while maintaining competitive performance.},

  abstract     = {Deep Neural Networks ({DNN}s) are one of the most powerful tools for prediction, but many of them implicitly assume that the data are statistically independent. However, in the real world, it is common for large-scale data to be clustered with temporal-spatial correlation structures. Variational approaches and integrated likelihood approaches have been proposed to obtain approximate maximum likelihood estimators ({MLE}s) for correlated data. However, due to the large size of data, they cannot provide exact {MLE}s. In this study, we propose a new hierarchical likelihood approach to {DNN}s with correlated random effects for clustered data. By jointly optimizing the negative h-likelihood loss, we can provide exact {MLE}s for both mean and dispersion parameters, as well as the best linear unbiased predictors for the random effects. Moreover, the hierarchical likelihood allows a computable procedure for restricted maximum likelihood estimators of dispersion parameters. The proposed two-step algorithm enables online learning for the neural networks, whereas the integrated likelihood cannot decompose like a widely-used loss function in {DNN}s. The proposed h-likelihood approach offers several advantages, which we demonstrate through numerical studies and real data analyses.},

  abstract     = {Recently, unsupervised representation learning ({URL}) has improved the sample efficiency of Reinforcement Learning ({RL}) by pretraining a model from a large unlabeled dataset. The underlying principle of these methods is to learn temporally predictive representations by predicting future states in the latent space. However, we found that the subspace of the latent representations collapses into a low-dimensional manifold, which we call representational collapse. This collapse can result in a significant loss of information, leading to poor downstream task performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel {URL} framework that causally predicts future states while increasing the dimension of the latent manifold by decorrelating the features in the latent space. Through extensive empirical studies, we demonstrate that our framework effectively learns predictive representations without collapse, significantly improving the sample efficiency of state-of-the-art {URL} methods on the Atari 100k benchmark.},

Recent work suggests that the notion of disagreement, the degree to which two models trained with different randomness differ on the same input, is a key to tackling this problem. Experimentally, disagreement and prediction error have been shown to be strongly connected, which has been used to estimate model performance. Experiments have led to the discovery of the disagreement-on-the-line phenomenon, whereby the classification error under the target domain is often a linear function of the classification error under the source domain; and whenever this property holds, disagreement under the source and target domain follow the same linear relation. In this work, we develop a theoretical foundation for analyzing disagreement in high-dimensional random features regression; and study under what conditions the disagreement-on-the-line phenomenon occurs in our setting. Experiments on {CIFAR}-10-C, Tiny {ImageNet}-C, and Camelyon17 are consistent with our theory and support the universality of the theoretical findings.},

We propose a new unsupervised skill discovery algorithm that discovers a set of skills that can represent shared structures across changing environments. Our algorithm trains incremental skills and encourages a new skill to expand state coverage obtained with compositions of previously learned skills. The experimental results show that our algorithm acquires skills that represent shared structures across changing maze navigation and locomotion environments.

In this paper, we establish novel generalization bounds for contrastive learning which do not depend on $k$, up to logarithmic terms. Our analysis uses structural results on empirical covering numbers and {Rademacher} complexities to exploit the {Lipschitz} continuity of loss functions. For self-bounding {Lipschitz} loss functions, we further improve our results by developing optimistic bounds which imply fast rates in a low noise condition. We apply our results to learning with both linear representation and nonlinear representation by deep neural networks, for both of which we derive {Rademacher} complexity bounds to get improved generalization bounds.},

Our approach does not require rewards, and only employs supervised learning, which can be easily scaled to use state-of-the-art trajectory embedding techniques and policy representations.

  abstract     = {Parameter inference, i.e., inferring the posterior distribution of statistical model parameters given data, is central to many scientific disciplines. Generative models can serve as an alternative to {Markov} chain {Monte} {Carlo} for parameter inference, both in likelihood-based and simulation-based problems. However, assessing the accuracy of posteriors encoded in generative models is not straightforward. In this paper, we introduce Tests of Accuracy with Random Points ({TARP}) for evaluating posterior estimators. Our method differs from previously-existing coverage-based methods, which require posterior evaluations. We prove that our approach is necessary and sufficient to show that a posterior estimator is accurate, and demonstrate the method on synthetic examples. We show that {TARP} can be used to test the results of posterior inference analyses in high-dimensional spaces, where generative models are often needed due to the intractability of standard inference methods.},

  abstract     = {Counterfactual explanations have been widely studied in explainability, with a range of application dependent methods prominent in fairness, recourse and model understanding. The major shortcoming associated with these methods, however, is their inability to provide explanations beyond the local or instance-level. While many works touch upon the notion of a global explanation, typically suggesting to aggregate masses of local explanations in the hope of ascertaining global properties, few provide frameworks that are both reliable and computationally tractable. Meanwhile, practitioners are requesting more efficient and interactive explainability tools. We take this opportunity to propose Global \& Efficient Counterfactual Explanations (GLOBE-CE), a flexible framework that tackles the reliability and scalability issues associated with current state-of-the-art, particularly on higher dimensional datasets and in the presence of continuous features. Furthermore, we provide a unique mathematical analysis of categorical feature translations, utilising it in our method. Experimental evaluation with publicly available datasets and user studies demonstrate that GLOBE-CE performs significantly better than the current state-of-the-art across multiple metrics (e.g., speed, reliability).},

While many of these studies have yielded advancements in expressivity, they have frequently come at the expense of decreased efficiency or have been restricted to specific types of graphs. In this study, we investigate the expressivity of GNNs from the perspective of graph search. Specifically, we propose a new vertex colouring scheme and demonstrate that classical search algorithms can efficiently compute graph representations that extend beyond the 1-WL. We show that our colouring scheme inherits useful properties from graph search that can help solve problems like graph biconnectivity. Under certain conditions, the expressivity of GNNs increases hierarchically with the radius of the search neighbourhood. To further investigate our scheme, we develop a new type of GNN based on two search strategies: breadth-first search and depth-first search, highlighting the graph properties they can capture on top of 1-WL.},

We propose Structured Cooperative Learning (SCooL), in which a cooperation graph across devices is generated by a graphical model prior to automatically coordinate mutual learning between devices. By choosing graphical models enforcing different structures, we can derive a rich class of existing and novel decentralized learning algorithms via variational inference. In particular, we show three instantiations of SCooL that adopt Dirac distribution, stochastic block model (SBM), and attention as the prior generating cooperation graphs. These EM-type algorithms alternate between updating the cooperation graph and cooperative learning of local models. They can automatically capture the cross-task correlations among devices by only monitoring their model updating in order to optimize the cooperation graph. We evaluate SCooL and compare it with existing decentralized learning methods on an extensive set of benchmarks, on which SCooL always achieves the highest accuracy of personalized models and significantly outperforms other baselines on communication efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In federated learning (FL) systems, e.g., wireless networks, the communication cost between the clients and the central server can often be a bottleneck. To reduce the communication cost, the paradigm of communication compression has become a popular strategy in the literature. In this paper, we focus on biased gradient compression techniques in non-convex FL problems. In the classical setting of distributed learning, the method of error feedback (EF) is a common technique to remedy the downsides of biased gradient compression. In this work, we study a compressed FL scheme equipped with error feedback, named Fed-EF. We further propose two variants: Fed-EF-SGD and Fed-EF-AMS, depending on the choice of the global model optimizer. We provide a generic theoretical analysis, which shows that directly applying biased compression in FL leads to a non-vanishing bias in the convergence rate. The proposed Fed-EF is able to match the convergence rate of the full-precision FL counterparts under data heterogeneity with a linear speedup. Moreover, we develop a new analysis of the EF under partial client participation, which is an important scenario in FL. We prove that under partial participation, the convergence rate of Fed-EF exhibits an extra slow-down factor due to a so-called 'stale error compensation' effect. Finally, we also demonstrate that incorporating the two-way compression in Fed-EF does not change the convergence results.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is a trending training paradigm to utilize decentralized training data. FL allows clients to update model parameters locally for several epochs, then share them to a global model for aggregation. This training paradigm with multi-local step updating before aggregation exposes unique vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is a popular and effective method to improve the robustness of networks against adversaries. In this work, we formulate a general form of federated adversarial learning (FAL) that is adapted from adversarial learning in the centralized setting. On the client side of FL training, FAL has an inner loop to generate adversarial samples for adversarial training and an outer loop to update local model parameters. On the server side, FAL aggregates local model updates and broadcasts the aggregated model. We design a global robust training loss and formulate FAL training as a min-max optimization problem. Unlike classical centralized training convergence analysis, analyzing FAL convergence is significantly harder due to the complexity of min-max optimization, model not updating in the gradient direction due to multi-local updates, and inter-client heterogeneity. We address these challenges using gradient approximation and coupling techniques, presenting convergence analysis in the over-parameterized regime.},

Offline PLfO aims to learn policies using datasets with substandard qualities: 1) only a subset of trajectories is labeled with rewards, 2) labeled trajectories may not contain actions, 3) labeled trajectories may not be of high quality, and 4) the data may not have full coverage. Such imperfection is common in real-world learning scenarios, and offline PLfO encompasses many existing offline learning setups, including offline imitation learning (IL), offline IL from observations (ILfO), and offline reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we present a generic approach to offline PLfO, called Modality-agnostic Adversarial Hypothesis Adaptation for Learning from Observations (MAHALO). Built upon the pessimism concept in offline RL, MAHALO optimizes the policy using a performance lower bound that accounts for uncertainty due to the dataset's insufficient coverage. We implement this idea by adversarially training data-consistent critic and reward functions, which forces the learned policy to be robust to data deficiency. We show that MAHALO consistently outperforms or matches specialized algorithms across a variety of offline PLfO tasks in theory and experiments.},

We suggest an alternate approach: rather than hoping our static datasets transfer to our desired tasks after large-scale pre-training, we propose dynamically utilizing the Internet to quickly train a small-scale model that does extremely well on the task at hand. Our approach, called Internet Explorer, explores the web in a self-supervised manner to progressively find relevant examples that improve performance on a desired target dataset. It cycles between searching for images on the Internet with text queries, self-supervised training on downloaded images, determining which images were useful, and prioritizing what to search for next. We evaluate Internet Explorer across several datasets and show that it outperforms or matches CLIP oracle performance by using just a single GPU desktop to actively query the Internet for 30--40 hours.},

Based on this new DTMC-based analysis, we further propose TIPS, a framework to automatically design AnytimeNNs under various hardware constraints. Our experimental results show that TIPS can improve the convergence rate and test accuracy of AnytimeNNs. Compared to the existing AnytimeNNs approaches, TIPS improves the accuracy by 2\%--6.6\% on multiple datasets and achieves SOTA accuracy-FLOPs tradeoffs.},

One commonly employed numerical solver is the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm, whose performance is largely affected by the preconditioner quality. However, designing high-performing preconditioner with traditional numerical methods is highly non-trivial, often requiring problem-specific knowledge and meticulous matrix operations. We present a new method that leverages learning-based approach to obtain an approximate matrix factorization to the system matrix to be used as a preconditioner in the context of PCG solvers. Our high-level intuition comes from the shared property between preconditioners and network-based PDE solvers that excels at obtaining approximate solutions at a low computational cost. Such observation motivates us to represent preconditioners as graph neural networks (GNNs). In addition, we propose a new loss function that rewrites traditional preconditioner metrics to incorporate inductive bias from PDE data distributions, enabling effective training of high-performing preconditioners. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of our proposed approach on solving various 2D and 3D linear second-order PDEs.},

To address this pivotal issue, we propose a prototype-oriented UAD (PUAD) method under a probabilistic framework. Specifically, instead of learning the mappings for each MTS, the proposed PUAD views multiple MTSs as the distribution over a group of prototypes, which are extracted to represent a diverse set of normal patterns. To learn and regulate the prototypes, PUAD introduces a reconstruction-based unsupervised anomaly detection approach, which incorporates a prototype-oriented optimal transport method into a Transformer-powered probabilistic dynamical generative framework. Leveraging meta-learned transferable prototypes, PUAD can achieve high model adaptation capacity for new MTSs. Experiments on five public MTS datasets all verify the effectiveness of the proposed UAD method.},

  abstract     = {The study of universal approximation properties (UAP) for neural networks (NN) has a long history. When the network width is unlimited, only a single hidden layer is sufficient for UAP. In contrast, when the depth is unlimited, the width for UAP needs to be not less than the critical width $w^*_{\min}=\max(d_x,d_y)$, where $d_x$ and $d_y$ are the dimensions of the input and output, respectively. Recently, (Cai, 2022) shows that a leaky-ReLU NN with this critical width can achieve UAP for $L^p$ functions on a compact domain $\mathcal{K}$, i.e., the UAP for $L^p(\mathcal{K},\mathbb{R}^{d_y})$. This paper examines a uniform UAP for the function class $C(\mathcal{K},\mathbb{R}^{d_y})$ and gives the exact minimum width of the leaky-ReLU NN as $w_{\min}=\max(d_x+1,d_y)+1_{d_y=d_x+1}$, which involves the effects of the output dimensions. To obtain this result, we propose a novel lift-flow-discretization approach that shows that the uniform UAP has a deep connection with topological theory.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant progress, but often suffer from fairness issues, as deep models typically show distinct accuracy differences among certain subgroups (e.g., males and females). Existing research addresses this critical issue by employing fairness-aware loss functions to constrain the last-layer outputs and directly regularize DNNs. Although the fairness of DNNs is improved, it is unclear how the trained network makes a fair prediction, which limits future fairness improvements. In this paper, we investigate fairness from the perspective of decision rationale and define the parameter parity score to characterize the fair decision process of networks by analyzing neuron influence in various subgroups. Extensive empirical studies show that the unfair issue could arise from the unaligned decision rationales of subgroups. Existing fairness regularization terms fail to achieve decision rationale alignment because they only constrain last-layer outputs while ignoring intermediate neuron alignment. To address the issue, we formulate the fairness as a new task, i.e., decision rationale alignment that requires DNNs' neurons to have consistent responses on subgroups at both intermediate processes and the final prediction. To make this idea practical during optimization, we relax the naive objective function and propose gradient-guided parity alignment, which encourages gradient-weighted consistency of neurons across subgroups. Extensive experiments on a variety of datasets show that our method can significantly enhance fairness while sustaining a high level of accuracy and outperforming other approaches by a wide margin.},

StepMix features a unique design of a mixture policy that adaptively and smoothly interpolates between the baseline policy and the optimistic policy. Theoretical analysis shows that StepMix achieves near-optimal regret order as in the constraint-free setting, indicating that obeying the stringent episode-wise conservative constraint does not compromise the learning performance.},

However, the model performance of FL may degrade a lot due to non-IID data. While many FL algorithms focus on non-IID labels, FL on non-IID features has largely been overlooked. Different from typical FL approaches, the paper proposes a new learning concept called ADCOL (Adversarial Collaborative Learning) for non-IID features. Instead of adopting the widely used model-averaging scheme, ADCOL conducts training in an adversarial way: the server aims to train a discriminator to distinguish the representations of the parties, while the parties aim to generate a common representation distribution. Our experiments show that ADCOL achieves better performance than state-of-the-art FL algorithms on non-IID features.},

To enable efficient knowledge sharing and policy exploration, RACE decomposes the policies of different teams controlling the same agent into a shared nonlinear observation representation encoder and individual linear policy representations.

In this work, we formalize in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem where a transformer model implicitly constructs a hypothesis function at inference-time. We first explore the statistical aspects of this abstraction through the lens of multitask learning: We obtain generalization bounds for ICL when the input prompt is (1) a sequence of i.i.d. (input, label) pairs or (2) a trajectory arising from a dynamical system. The crux of our analysis is relating the excess risk to the stability of the algorithm implemented by the transformer. We characterize when transformer/attention architecture provably obeys the stability condition and also provide empirical verification. For generalization on unseen tasks, we identify an inductive bias phenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by the task complexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner. Finally, we provide numerical evaluations that (1) demonstrate transformers can indeed implement near-optimal algorithms on classical regression problems with i.i.d. and dynamic data, (2) provide insights on stability, and (3) verify our theoretical predictions.},

In this paper, we propose two new algorithms, {AOGD-ALD} and {NONS-ALD}, which can keep nearly optimal regret bounds at a sublinear computational complexity, and give sufficient conditions under which our algorithms work. Both algorithms dynamically maintain a group of nearly orthogonal basis used to approximate the kernel mapping, and keep nearly optimal regret bounds by controlling the approximate error. The number of basis depends on the approximate error and the decay rate of eigenvalues of the kernel matrix. If the eigenvalues decay exponentially, then {AOGD-ALD} and {NONS-ALD} separately achieves a regret of {$O(\sqrt{L(f)})$} and {$O(d_{\text{eff}}(\mu)\ln T)$} at a computational complexity in {$O(\ln^2 T)$}. If the eigenvalues decay polynomially with degree {$p \geq 1$}, then our algorithms keep the same regret bounds at a computational complexity in {$o(T)$} in the case of {$p > 4$} and {$p \geq 10$}, respectively. {$L(f)$} is the cumulative losses of {$f$} and {$d_{\text{eff}}(\mu)$} is the effective dimension of the problem. The two regret bounds are nearly optimal and are not comparable.},

In this paper, we propose a novel defense called {R}econstructive {N}euron {P}runing ({RNP}) to expose and prune backdoor neurons via an unlearning and then recovering process. Specifically, {RNP} first unlearns the neurons by maximizing the model's error on a small subset of clean samples and then recovers the neurons by minimizing the model's error on the same data. In {RNP}, unlearning is operated at the neuron level while recovering is operated at the filter level, forming an asymmetric reconstructive learning procedure.},

Their capabilities have been probed on benchmarks which include a variety of structured and reasoning tasks---but mathematical understanding is lagging substantially behind. Recent lines of work have begun studying representational aspects of this question: that is, the size/depth/complexity of attention-based networks to perform certain tasks. However, there is no guarantee the learning dynamics will converge to the constructions proposed. In our paper, we provide fine-grained mechanistic understanding of how transformers learn ``semantic structure'', understood as capturing co-occurrence structure of words. Precisely, we show, through a combination of mathematical analysis and experiments on {W}ikipedia data and synthetic data modeled by {L}atent {D}irichlet {A}llocation ({LDA}), that the embedding layer and the self-attention layer encode the topical structure. In the former case, this manifests as higher average inner product of embeddings between same-topic words. In the latter, it manifests as higher average pairwise attention between same-topic words. The mathematical results involve several assumptions to make the analysis tractable, which we verify on data, and might be of independent interest as well.},

First, we find that the sum of weights can be smaller than 1, causing global weight shrinking effect (analogous to weight decay) and improving generalization. We explore how the optimal shrinking factor is affected by clients' data heterogeneity and local epochs.

We first prove the capacity-dependent optimal guarantees of {N}ystr\"{o}m approximation with the standard uniform sampling, which covers both loss functions and applies to some agnostic settings. Then, using data-dependent sampling, for example, leverage scores sampling, we derive the capacity-dependent optimal rates that apply to the whole range of the agnostic setting. To our best knowledge, the capacity-dependent optimality for the whole range of the agnostic setting is first achieved and novel in {N}ystr\"{o}m approximation.},

Despite the well-known fact that a neural network is a universal approximator, in this study, we mathematically show that when hidden parameters are distributed in a bounded domain, the network may not achieve zero approximation error. In particular, we derive a new nontrivial approximation error lower bound. The proof utilizes the technique of ridgelet analysis, a harmonic analysis method designed for neural networks. This method is inspired by fundamental principles in classical signal processing, specifically the idea that signals with limited bandwidth may not always be able to perfectly reconstruct the original signal. We corroborate our theoretical results with various simulation studies, and generally, two main take-home messages are offered: (i) Not any distribution for selecting random weights is feasible to build a universal approximator; (ii) A suitable assignment of random weights exists but to some degree is associated with the complexity of the target function.},

Problems of deadly triad, limited data and reward sparsity, however, still remain, rendering the design of effective, hierarchical offline {RL} algorithms for general-purpose policy learning a formidable challenge. In this paper, we first formulate the problem of offline long-horizon decision-making from the perspective of conditional generative modeling by incorporating goals into the control-as-inference graphic models. A Hierarchical trajectory-level Diffusion probabilistic model is then proposed with classifier-free guidance. {HDMI} employs a cascade framework that utilizes the reward-conditional goal diffuser for the subgoal discovery and the goal-conditional trajectory diffuser for generating the corresponding action sequence of subgoals. Planning-based subgoal extraction and transformer-based diffusion are employed to deal with the sub-optimal data pollution and long-range subgoal dependencies in the goal diffusion. Numerical experiments verify the advantages of {HDMI} on long-horizon decision-making compared to {SOTA} offline {RL} methods and conditional generative models.},

  abstract     = {Policy optimization methods are powerful algorithms in Reinforcement Learning ({RL}) for their flexibility to deal with policy parameterization and ability to handle model misspecification. However, these methods usually suffer from slow convergence rates and poor sample complexity. Hence it is important to design provably sample efficient algorithms for policy optimization. Yet, recent advances for this problem have only been successful in tabular and linear settings, whose benign structures cannot be generalized to non-linearly parameterized policies. In this paper, we address this problem by leveraging recent advances in value-based algorithms, including bounded eluder-dimension and online sensitivity sampling, to design a low-switching sample-efficient policy optimization algorithm, {LPO}, with general non-linear function approximation. We show that our algorithm obtains an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy with only $\widetilde{O}(\frac{\text{poly}(d)}{\varepsilon^3})$ samples, where $\varepsilon$ is the suboptimality gap and $d$ is a complexity measure of the function class approximating the policy. This drastically improves the previously best-known sample bound for policy optimization algorithms, $\widetilde{O}(\frac{\text{poly}(d)}{\varepsilon^8})$. Moreover, we empirically test our theory with deep neural nets to show the benefits of the theoretical inspiration.},

Its underlying idea is simple: a portion of the input image is randomly masked out and then reconstructed via the pre-text task. However, the working principle behind {MIM} is not well explained, and previous studies insist that {MIM} primarily works for the {T}ransformer family but is incompatible with {CNN}s. In this paper, we first study interactions among patches to understand what knowledge is learned and how it is acquired via the {MIM} task. We observe that {MIM} essentially teaches the model to learn better middle-order interactions among patches and extract more generalized features. Based on this fact, we propose an {A}rchitecture-{A}gnostic {M}asked {I}mage {M}odeling framework ({A$^2$MIM}), which is compatible with both {T}ransformers and {CNN}s in a unified way.},

Despite increasing efforts towards improving the quality of generic data types, such as images and texts, the problem of mislabel detection in graph data remains underexplored. To bridge the gap, we propose {GraphCleaner}, a post-hoc method to detect and correct mislabelled nodes in graph datasets. {GraphCleaner} combines two novel ideas: 1) Synthetic Mislabel Dataset Generation, which seeks to generate realistic mislabels and 2) Neighborhood-Aware Mislabel Detection, where neighborhood dependency is exploited in both labels and base classifier predictions. Empirical evaluations on 6 datasets and 6 experimental settings demonstrate that {GraphCleaner} outperforms the closest baseline, with an average improvement of 0.14 in {F1} score, and 0.16 in {MCC}. On real-data case studies, {GraphCleaner} detects previously unknown mislabels in popular graph benchmarks like {PubMed}, {Cora}, {CiteSeer} and {OGB}-arxiv. The researchers found that at least 6.91\% of {PubMed} data is mislabelled or ambiguous, and simply removing these mislabelled data can boost evaluation performance from 86.71\% to 89.11\%.},

  abstract     = {Fairness is essential for machine learning systems deployed in high-stake applications. Among all fairness notions, individual fairness, deriving from a consensus that `similar individuals should be treated similarly,' is a vital notion to describe fair treatment for individual cases. Previous studies typically characterize individual fairness as a prediction-invariant problem when perturbing sensitive attributes on samples, and solve it by {D}istributionally {R}obust {O}ptimization ({DRO}) paradigm. However, such adversarial perturbations along a direction covering sensitive information used in {DRO} do not consider the inherent feature correlations or innate data constraints, therefore could mislead the model to optimize at off-manifold and unrealistic samples. In light of this drawback, in this paper, we propose to learn and generate antidote data that approximately follows the data distribution to remedy individual unfairness. These generated on-manifold antidote data can be used through a generic optimization procedure along with original training data, resulting in a pure pre-processing approach to individual unfairness, or can also fit well with the in-processing {DRO} paradigm. Through extensive experiments on multiple tabular datasets, we demonstrate our method resists individual unfairness at a minimal or zero cost to predictive utility compared to baselines.},

Nevertheless, there are still many questions to be addressed. How to estimate the propensity more conducive to debiasing performance? Which metric is more reasonable to measure the quality of the learned propensities? Is it better to make the cross-entropy loss as small as possible when learning propensities? In this paper, we first discuss the potential problems of the previously widely adopted metrics for learned propensities, and propose balanced-mean-squared-error ({BMSE}) metric for debiased recommendations. Based on {BMSE}, we propose {IPS}-{V2} and {DR}-{V2} as the estimators of unbiased loss, and theoretically show that {IPS}-{V2} and {DR}-{V2} have greater propensity balancing and smaller variance without sacrificing additional bias. We further propose a co-training method for learning balanced representation and unbiased prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets including a large industrial dataset, and the results show that our approach boosts the balancing property and results in enhanced debiasing performance.},

However, most of the existing training methods rely on maximizing the likelihood of event sequences, which involves calculating some intractable integral. Moreover, the existing methods fail to provide uncertainty quantification for model predictions, e.g., confidence intervals for the predicted event's arrival time. To address these issues, we propose {SMURF-THP}, a score-based method for learning {T}ransformer {H}awkes process and quantifying prediction uncertainty. Specifically, {SMURF-THP} learns the score function of events' arrival time based on a score-matching objective that avoids the intractable computation. With such a learned score function, we can sample arrival time of events from the predictive distribution. This naturally allows for the quantification of uncertainty by computing confidence intervals over the generated samples. We conduct extensive experiments in both event type prediction and uncertainty quantification on time of arrival. In all the experiments, {SMURF-THP} outperforms existing likelihood-based methods in confidence calibration while exhibiting comparable prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Horizon dependence is an important difference between reinforcement learning and other machine learning paradigms. Yet, existing results tackling the (exact) horizon dependence either assume that the reward is bounded per step, introducing unfair comparison, or assume strict total boundedness that requires the sum of rewards to be bounded _almost surely_ -- allowing only restricted noise on the reward observation. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a new relaxation -- _expected boundedness_ on rewards, where we allow the reward to be stochastic with only boundedness on the _expected_ sum -- opening the door to study horizon-dependence with a much broader set of reward functions with noises. We establish a novel generic algorithm that achieves _no-horizon dependence_ in terms of sample complexity for both Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and Games, via reduction to a good-conditioned _auxiliary Markovian environment_, in which only "important" state-action pairs are preserved. The algorithm takes only $\tilde{O}(\frac{S^2A}{\epsilon^2})$ episodes interacting with such an environment to achieve an $\epsilon$-optimal policy/strategy (with high probability), improving (zhang, 2022) (which only applies to MDPs with deterministic rewards). Here $S$ is the number of states and $A$ is the number of actions, and the bound is independent of the horizon $H$.},

While module-level unit test metrics adopted from traditional computer vision tasks are feasible to some extent, it remains far less explored to measure the impact of perceptual noise on the driving quality of autonomous vehicles in a consistent and holistic manner. In this work, we propose a principled framework that provides a coherent and systematic understanding of the impact an error in the perception module imposes on an autonomous agent's planning that actually controls the vehicle. Specifically, the planning process is formulated as expected utility maximisation, where all input signals from upstream modules jointly provide a world state description, and the planner strives for the optimal action by maximising the expected utility determined by both world states and actions. We show that, under practical conditions, the objective function can be represented as an inner product between the world state description and the utility function in a Hilbert space. This geometric interpretation enables a novel way to analyse the impact of noise in world state estimation on planning and leads to a universal metric for evaluating perception. The whole framework resembles the idea of transcendental idealism in the classical philosophical literature, which gives the name to our approach.},

We propose FedVS to simultaneously address these two challenges. The key idea of FedVS is to design secret sharing schemes for the local data and models, such that information-theoretical privacy against colluding clients and curious server is guaranteed, and the aggregation of all clients' embeddings is reconstructed losslessly, via decrypting computation shares from the non-straggling clients. Extensive experiments on various types of VFL datasets (including tabular, CV, and multi-view) demonstrate the universal advantages of FedVS in straggler mitigation and privacy protection over baseline protocols.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops an approximation scheme for solving bilevel programs with equilibrium constraints, which are generally difficult to solve. Among other things, calculating the first-order derivative in such a problem requires differentiation across the hierarchy, which is computationally intensive, if not prohibitive. To bypass the hierarchy, we propose to bound such bilevel programs, equivalent to multiple-followers Stackelberg games, with two new hierarchy-free problems: a T-step Cournot game and a T-step monopoly model. Since they are standard equilibrium or optimization problems, both can be efficiently solved via first-order methods. Importantly, we show that the bounds provided by these problems -- the upper bound by the T-step Cournot game and the lower bound by the T-step monopoly model -- can be made arbitrarily tight by increasing the step parameter T for a wide range of problems. We prove that a small T usually suffices under appropriate conditions to reach an approximation acceptable for most practical purposes.},

  abstract     = {Many problems, such as online ad display, can be formulated as online bipartite matching. The crucial challenge lies in the nature of sequentially-revealed online item information, based on which we make irreversible matching decisions at each step. While numerous expert online algorithms have been proposed with bounded worst-case competitive ratios, they may not offer satisfactory performance in average cases. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to improve the average performance, but it lacks robustness and can perform arbitrarily poorly. In this paper, we propose a novel RL-based approach to edge-weighted online bipartite matching with robustness guarantees (LOMAR), achieving both good average-case and worst-case performance. The key novelty of LOMAR is a new online switching operation which, based on a judicious condition to hedge against future uncertainties, decides whether to follow the expert's decision or the RL decision for each online item.},

To reduce the size and complexity of these models, we propose LoSparse (Low-Rank and Sparse approximation), a novel model compression technique that approximates a weight matrix by the sum of a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix. Our method combines the advantages of both low-rank approximations and pruning, while avoiding their limitations. Low-rank approximation compresses the coherent and expressive parts in neurons, while pruning removes the incoherent and non-expressive parts in neurons. Pruning enhances the diversity of low-rank approximations, and low-rank approximation prevents pruning from losing too many expressive neurons. We evaluate our method on natural language understanding, question answering, and natural language generation tasks. We show that it significantly outperforms existing compression methods.},

In this work, we take a different approach and study whether we can reap benefits by reformulating a single challenging task as a multi-task RL problem, where the task space contains not only the challenging task of interest but also easier tasks that implicitly function as a curriculum. Such a reformulation opens up the possibility of running existing multi-task RL methods as a more efficient alternative to solving a single challenging task from scratch. We provide a theoretical framework that reformulates a single-task RL problem as a multi-task RL problem defined by a curriculum, and under mild regularity conditions on the curriculum, we show that sequentially solving each task in the multi-task RL problem is more computationally efficient than solving the original single-task problem.},

This interdependence between the policy and the discriminator leads to an unstable learning process because reward signals from an immature discriminator are noisy and impede policy learning, and conversely, an under-optimized policy impedes discriminator learning. We call this learning setting Internally Rewarded Reinforcement Learning (IRRL) as the reward is not provided directly by the environment but internally by the discriminator. In this paper, we formally formulate IRRL and present a class of problems that belong to IRRL. We theoretically derive and empirically analyze the effect of the reward function in IRRL and based on these analyses propose the clipped linear reward function.},

Previous policy learning approaches aim at the well-being of subgroups by maximizing the utility function (e.g., conditional average causal effects, post-view click-through and conversion rate in recommendations), however, individual-level counterfactual no-harm criterion has rarely been discussed. In this paper, we first formalize the counterfactual no-harm criterion for policy learning from a principal stratification perspective. Next, we propose a novel upper bound for the fraction negatively affected by the policy and show the consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator. Based on the estimators for the policy utility and harm upper bounds, we further propose a policy learning approach that satisfies the counterfactual no-harm criterion, and prove its consistency to the optimal policy reward for parametric and non-parametric policy classes, respectively. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed policy learning approach for satisfying the counterfactual no-harm criterion.},

The recent approach TNLS showed promising results for this task, however, its computational efficiency is still unaffordable, requiring too many evaluations of the objective function. We propose TnALE, a new algorithm that updates each structure-related variable alternately by local enumeration, greatly reducing the number of evaluations compared to TNLS. We theoretically investigate the descent steps for TNLS and TnALE, proving that both algorithms can achieve linear convergence up to a constant if a sufficient reduction of the objective is reached in each neighborhood. We also compare the evaluation efficiency of TNLS and TnALE, revealing that Ω(2^N) evaluations are typically required in TNLS for reaching the objective reduction in the neighborhood, while ideally O(N²R) evaluations are sufficient in TnALE, where N denotes the tensor order and R reflects the "low-rankness" of the neighborhood. Experimental results verify that TnALE can find practically good TN-ranks and permutations with vastly fewer evaluations than the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

By exploiting historical transitions, a policy is trained to maximize a learned value function while constrained by the behavior policy to avoid a significant distributional shift. In this paper, we propose our closed-form policy improvement operators. We make a novel observation that the behavior constraint naturally motivates the use of first-order Taylor approximation, leading to a linear approximation of the policy objective. Additionally, as practical datasets are usually collected by heterogeneous policies, we model the behavior policies as a Gaussian Mixture and overcome the induced optimization difficulties by leveraging the LogSumExp's lower bound and Jensen's Inequality, giving rise to a closed-form policy improvement operator. We instantiate both one-step and iterative offline RL algorithms with our novel policy improvement operators and empirically demonstrate their effectiveness over state-of-the-art algorithms on the standard D4RL benchmark.},

The approach involves learning a minimum distortion homeomorphic mapping between the constraint set and a unit ball using a bi-Lipschitz invertible neural network, and then performing a simple bisection operation concerning the unit ball such that the mapped final solution is feasible with respect to the constraint set with minor distortion-induced optimality loss.},

To achieve this, we introduce two estimation schemes based on concentration bounds derived from the empirical distribution, specifically using either the Wasserstein distance or the supremum distance. Unlike traditional approaches that add or subtract a confidence radius from the empirical risk measures, our proposed schemes evaluate a specific transformation of the empirical distribution based on the distance. Our confidence bounds consistently yield tighter results compared to previous methods. We further verify the efficacy of the proposed framework by providing tighter problem-dependent regret bound for the CVaR bandit.},

However, the quality of the diffusion model is limited by the insufficient diversity of training data, which hinders the performance of planning and the generalizability to new tasks. This paper introduces AdaptDiffuser, an evolutionary planning method with diffusion that can self-evolve to improve the diffusion model hence a better planner, not only for seen tasks but can also adapt to unseen tasks. AdaptDiffuser enables the generation of rich synthetic expert data for goal-conditioned tasks using guidance from reward gradients. It then selects high-quality data via a discriminator to finetune the diffusion model, which improves the generalization ability to unseen tasks. Empirical experiments on two benchmark environments and two carefully designed unseen tasks in KUKA industrial robot arm and Maze2D environments demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaptDiffuser. For example, AdaptDiffuser not only outperforms the previous art Diffuser by 20.8% on Maze2D and 7.5% on MuJoCo locomotion, but also adapts better to new tasks, e.g., KUKA pick-and-place, by 27.9% without requiring additional expert data.},

Despite recent empirical studies positing a near-perfect linear correlation between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies, we empirically demonstrate that this correlation is more nuanced under subpopulation shifts. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis across a variety of datasets, models, and training epochs, we demonstrate that OOD performance often has a nonlinear correlation with ID performance in subpopulation shifts. Our findings, which contrast previous studies that have posited a linear correlation in model performance during distribution shifts, reveal a "moon shape" correlation (parabolic uptrend curve) between the test performance on the majority subpopulation and the minority subpopulation. This non-trivial nonlinear correlation holds across model architectures, hyperparameters, training durations, and the imbalance between subpopulations. Furthermore, we found that the nonlinearity of this "moon shape" is causally influenced by the degree of spurious correlations in the training data. Our controlled experiments show that stronger spurious correlation in the training data creates more nonlinear performance correlation. We provide complementary experimental and theoretical analyses for this phenomenon, and discuss its implications for ML reliability and fairness.},

They either require an excessive budget (in terms of the number of compilation passes) at compile time or fail to generalize to unseen programs. In this work, instead of predicting passes sequentially, we directly learn a policy on the pass sequence space, which outperforms the default -Oz flag by an average of 4.5% over a large collection (4683) of unseen code repositories from diverse domains across 14 datasets. To achieve this, we first identify a small set (termed coreset) of pass sequences that generally optimize the size of most programs. Then, a policy is learned to pick the optimal sequences by predicting the normalized values of the pass sequences in the coreset. Our results demonstrate that existing human-designed compiler passes can be improved with a simple yet effective technique that leverages pass sequence space which contains dense rewards, while approaches operating on the individual pass space may suffer from issues of sparse reward, and do not generalize well to held-out programs from different domains.},

  abstract     = {Recently, Diffusion Models (DMs) boost a wave in AI for Art yet raise new copyright concerns, where infringers benefit from using unauthorized paintings to train DMs to generate novel paintings in a similar style. To address these emerging copyright violations, in this paper, we are the first to explore and propose to utilize adversarial examples for DMs to protect human-created artworks. Specifically, we first build a theoretical framework to define and evaluate the adversarial examples for DMs. Then, based on this framework, we design a novel algorithm, named AdvDM, which exploits a Monte-Carlo estimation of adversarial examples for DMs by optimizing upon different latent variables sampled from the reverse process of DMs. Extensive experiments show that the generated adversarial examples can effectively hinder DMs from extracting their features. Therefore, our method can be a powerful tool for human artists to protect their copyright against infringers equipped with DM-based AI-for-Art applications.},

Regarding queries as cluster centers, {CLUSTSEG} is innovative in two aspects: 1) cluster centers are initialized in heterogeneous ways so as to pointedly address task-specific demands (e.g., instance- or category-level distinctiveness), yet without modifying the architecture; and 2) pixel-cluster assignment, formalized in a cross-attention fashion, is alternated with cluster center update, yet without learning additional parameters. These innovations closely link {CLUSTSEG} to {EM} clustering and make it a transparent and powerful framework that yields superior results across the above segmentation tasks.},

This paper addresses the above limitation with conformalized early stopping: a novel method that combines early stopping with conformal calibration while efficiently recycling the same hold-out data. This leads to models that are both accurate and able to provide exact predictive inferences without multiple data splits nor overly conservative adjustments. Practical implementations are developed for different learning tasks -- outlier detection, multi-class classification, regression -- and their competitive performance is demonstrated on real data.},

  abstract     = {Layer-wise distillation is a powerful tool to compress large models (i.e. teacher models) into small ones (i.e., student models). The student distills knowledge from the teacher by mimicking the hidden representations of the teacher at every intermediate layer. However, layer-wise distillation is difficult. Since the student has a smaller model capacity than the teacher, it is often under-fitted. Furthermore, the hidden representations of the teacher contain redundant information that the student does not necessarily need for the target task's learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Task-aware layEr-wise Distillation ({TED}). {TED} designs task-aware filters to align the hidden representations of the student and the teacher at each layer. The filters select the knowledge that is useful for the target task from the hidden representations. As such, {TED} reduces the knowledge gap between the two models and helps the student to fit better on the target task. We evaluate {TED} in two scenarios: continual pre-training and fine-tuning. {TED} demonstrates significant and consistent improvements over existing distillation methods in both scenarios.},

We propose a statistical framework for the {FPPE} model, in which a limit {FPPE} with a continuum of items models the long-run steady-state behavior of the auction platform, and an observable {FPPE} consisting of a finite number of items provides the data to estimate primitives of the limit {FPPE}, such as revenue, Nash social welfare (a fair metric of efficiency), and other parameters of interest. We develop central limit theorems and asymptotically valid confidence intervals. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic local minimax optimality of our estimators. We then show that the theory can be used for conducting statistically valid A/B testing on auction platforms. Numerical simulations verify our central limit theorems, and empirical coverage rates for our confidence intervals agree with our theory.},

Many metric learning loss functions focus on learning a correct ranking of training samples, but strongly overfit semantically inconsistent labels and require a large amount of data. To address these shortcomings, we propose a new metric learning method, called contextual loss, which optimizes contextual similarity in addition to cosine similarity. Our contextual loss implicitly enforces semantic consistency among neighbors while converging to the correct ranking. We empirically show that the proposed loss is more robust to label noise, and is less prone to overfitting even when a large portion of train data is withheld. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art across four image retrieval benchmarks and multiple different evaluation settings.},

However, even the most complex simulators cannot capture all details in reality due to finite domain parameters and simplified physical models. Additionally, the existing methods often assume that the distribution of domain parameters belongs to a specific family of probability functions, such as normal distributions, which may not be correct. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach to {DR} by rethinking it from the perspective of adversarial state perturbation, without the need for reconfiguring the simulator or relying on prior knowledge about the environment.},

The capability to create new proteins with designed structures and functions would thus enable the engineering of cellular behavior and development of protein-based therapeutics and materials. Structure-based protein design aims to find structures that are designable (can be realized by a protein sequence), novel (have dissimilar geometry from natural proteins), and diverse (span a wide range of geometries). While advances in protein structure prediction have made it possible to predict structures of novel protein sequences, the combinatorially large space of sequences and structures limits the practicality of search-based methods. Generative models provide a compelling alternative, by implicitly learning the low-dimensional structure of complex data distributions. Here, we leverage recent advances in denoising diffusion probabilistic models and equivariant neural networks to develop Genie, a generative model of protein structures that performs discrete-time diffusion using a cloud of oriented reference frames in 3D space.},

However, most work has focused on the experimental performance of CL, and theoretical studies of CL are still limited. In particular, there is a lack of understanding on what factors are important and how they affect catastrophic forgetting and generalization performance. To fill this gap, our theoretical analysis, under overparameterized linear models, provides the first-known explicit form of the expected forgetting and generalization error for a general CL setup with an arbitrary number of tasks. Further analysis of such a key result yields a number of theoretical explanations about how overparameterization, task similarity, and task ordering affect both forgetting and generalization error of CL. More interestingly, by conducting experiments on real datasets using deep neural networks (DNNs), we show that some of these insights even go beyond the linear models and can be carried over to practical setups.},

We show that A-CODER attains the optimal convergence rate with improved dependence on the number of blocks compared to prior work. Furthermore, for the setting where the smooth component of the objective function is expressible in a finite sum form, we introduce a variance-reduced variant of A-CODER, VR-A-CODER, with state-of-the-art complexity guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms through numerical experiments.},

We introduce probabilistic unrolling, a method that combines Monte Carlo sampling with iterative linear solvers to circumvent matrix inversion. Our theoretical analyses reveal that unrolling and backpropagation through the iterations of the solver can accelerate gradient estimation for maximum likelihood estimation. In experiments on simulated and real data, we demonstrate that probabilistic unrolling learns latent Gaussian models up to an order of magnitude faster than gradient EM, with minimal losses in model performance.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies show that paddings in convolutional neural networks encode absolute position information which can negatively affect the model performance for certain tasks. However, existing metrics for quantifying the strength of positional information remain unreliable and frequently lead to erroneous results. To address this issue, we propose novel metrics for measuring and visualizing the encoded positional information. We formally define the encoded information as PPP (Position-information Pattern from Padding) and conduct a series of experiments to study its properties as well as its formation. The proposed metrics measure the presence of positional information more reliably than the existing metrics based on PosENet and a test in F-Conv. We also demonstrate that for any extant and proposed padding schemes, PPP is primarily a learning artifact and is less dependent on the characteristics of the underlying padding schemes.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at promoting the safe real-world deployment of Reinforcement Learning (RL), research on safe RL has made significant progress in recent years. However, most existing works in the literature still focus on the online setting where risky violations of the safety budget are likely to be incurred during training. Besides, in many real-world applications, the learned policy is required to respond to dynamically determined safety budgets (i.e., constraint threshold) in real time. In this paper, we target the above real-time budget constraint problem under the offline setting, and propose Trajectory-based REal-time Budget Inference (TREBI) as a novel solution that approaches this problem from the perspective of trajectory distribution. TREBI models this problem through diffusion model planning and solves it through iterative denoising over the trajectory space. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of TREBI in achieving adaptive safe control with flexible real-time budget constraints.},

For the more resourceful nodes to be willing to share their model updates, they need to be fairly incentivized. This paper explores an incentive design that guarantees fairness so that nodes receive rewards commensurate to their contributions. Our approach leverages an explore-then-exploit formulation to estimate the nodes' contributions for realizing our theoretically guaranteed fair incentives. However, we observe a rich get richer phenomenon arising from the existing approaches to guarantee fairness and it discourages the participation of the less resourceful nodes. To remedy this, we additionally preserve asymptotic equality, i.e., less resourceful nodes achieve equal performance eventually to the more resourceful nodes. We propose a novel collaborative learning algorithm that provably achieves both fairness and asymptotic equality simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {We study property prediction for crystal materials. A crystal structure consists of a minimal unit cell that is repeated infinitely in 3D space. How to accurately represent such repetitive structures in machine learning models remains unresolved. Current methods construct graphs by establishing edges only between nearby nodes, thereby failing to faithfully capture infinite repeating patterns and distant interatomic interactions. In this work, we propose several innovations to overcome these limitations. First, we propose to model physics-principled interatomic potentials directly instead of only using distances as in many existing methods. These potentials include the Coulomb potential, London dispersion potential, and Pauli repulsion potential. Second, we model the complete set of potentials among all atoms, instead of only between nearby atoms as in existing methods. This is enabled by our approximations of infinite potential summations with provable error bounds. We further develop efficient algorithms to compute the approximations. Finally, we propose to incorporate our computations of complete interatomic potentials into message passing neural networks for representation learning. We perform experiments on the JARVIS and Materials Project benchmarks for evaluation. Results show that the use of interatomic potentials and complete interatomic potentials leads to consistent performance improvements with reasonable computational costs.},

The standard assumption is that the algorithm knows the precise speeds of all machines. However, in practice, machine speeds are often unknown or imprecise. We investigate the question of whether knowing precise speeds is necessary for good performance. We present speed-oblivious algorithms that achieve competitive ratios that match or closely approximate those of speed-aware algorithms, even when the precise machine speeds are unknown. Our algorithms adapt to the speed configuration during runtime by observing job completion times. We provide theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in scenarios where machine speeds are uncertain or change dynamically. The results show that precise speed knowledge is not always essential for optimal online scheduling performance.},

This operation is straightforward for grid-like data, such as images, but challenging for graph data. The key difficulty lies in the fact that different graphs typically have different numbers of nodes, and thus there lacks a node-level correspondence between graphs. In this work, we propose {S-Mixup}, a simple yet effective mixup method for graph classification by soft alignments. Specifically, given a pair of graphs, we explicitly obtain node-level correspondence via computing a soft assignment matrix to match the nodes between two graphs. Based on the soft assignments, we transform the adjacency and node feature matrices of one graph, so that the transformed graph is aligned with the other graph.},

  abstract     = {Influence maximization ({IM}) is formulated as selecting a set of initial users from a social network to maximize the expected number of influenced users. Researchers have made great progress in designing various traditional methods, and their theoretical design and performance gain are close to a limit. In the past few years, learning-based {IM} methods have emerged to achieve stronger generalization ability to unknown graphs than traditional ones. However, the development of learning-based {IM} methods is still limited by fundamental obstacles, including 1) the difficulty of effectively solving the objective function; 2) the difficulty of characterizing the diversified underlying diffusion patterns; and 3) the difficulty of adapting the solution under various node-centrality-constrained {IM} variants. To cope with the above challenges, we design a novel framework {DeepIM} to generatively characterize the latent representation of seed sets, and we propose to learn the diversified information diffusion pattern in a data-driven and end-to-end manner. Finally, we design a novel objective function to infer optimal seed sets under flexible node-centrality-based budget constraints. Extensive analyses are conducted over both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the overall performance of {DeepIM}.},

We present extensive experiments showing that 12 state-of-the-art {PAP} methods are vulnerable to Image Shortcut Squeezing ({ISS}), which is based on simple compression (i.e., grayscale and {JPEG} compressions). On average, {ISS} restores the {CIFAR-10} model accuracy to 81.73\%, surpassing the previous best preprocessing-based countermeasures by 37.97\% absolute. {ISS} also (slightly) outperforms adversarial training and has higher generalizability to unseen perturbation norms and also higher efficiency. Our investigation reveals that the property of {PAP} perturbations depends on the type of surrogate model used for poison generation, and it explains why a specific {ISS} compression yields the best performance for a specific type of {PAP} perturbation.},

However, this assumption is not always valid for real-world tabular datasets with complex dependencies between feature sets, resulting in localized information that is harder to learn. To overcome this limitation, we propose a data-driven approach that learns feature set dependencies by representing feature sets as graph nodes and their relationships as learnable edges.

We propose to perturb the observed sample via Markov transition kernels, with respect to which the target distribution is invariant. This allows us to then employ the KSD test on the perturbed sample.

Although most existing pretraining methods focus on merely the single modality, recent research has shown that maximizing the mutual information (MI) between such two modalities enhances the molecule representation ability. Meanwhile, existing molecule multi-modal pretraining approaches approximate MI based on the representation space encoded from the topology and geometry, thus resulting in the loss of critical structural information of molecules. To address this issue, we propose MoleculeSDE.

To handle larger games, order-1 Knowledge-Limited Subgame Solving (1-KLSS) only considers the states in a knowledge-limited closure, which results in a much smaller subgame. However, 1-KLSS is unsafe. In this paper, we first extend 1-KLSS to Safe-1-KLSS and prove its safeness.

This work provides a generic study targeting the attention-based patch attack. First, we experimentally observe that adversarial patches only activate in a few layers and become lazy during attention updating. According to experiments, we study the theory of how a small adversarial patch perturbates the whole model. Based on understanding adversarial patch attacks, we propose a simple but efficient defense that correctly detects more than 95\% of adversarial patches.},

To address this, we introduce the Non-Uniform Neural Operator (NUNO), a comprehensive framework designed for efficient operator learning with non-uniform data. Leveraging a K-D tree-based domain decomposition, we transform non-uniform data into uniform grids while effectively controlling interpolation error, thereby paralleling the speed and accuracy of learning from non-uniform data. We conduct extensive experiments on 2D elasticity, (2+1)D channel flow, and a 3D multi-physics heatsink, which, to our knowledge, marks a novel exploration into 3D PDE problems with complex geometries. Our framework has reduced error rates by up to 60% and enhanced training speeds by 2x to 30x. The code is now available at https://github.com/thu-ml/NUNO.},

How to valuate fragmented data sources of which each only contains partial features and samples remains an open question. We start by presenting a method to calculate the counterfactual of removing a fragment from the aggregated data matrix. Based on the counterfactual calculation, we further propose 2D-Shapley, a theoretical framework for fragmented data valuation that uniquely satisfies some appealing axioms in the fragmented data context. 2D-Shapley empowers a range of new use cases, such as selecting useful data fragments, providing interpretation for sample-wise data values, and fine-grained data issue diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian Inference offers principled tools to tackle many critical problems with modern neural networks such as poor calibration and generalization, and data inefficiency. However, scaling Bayesian inference to large architectures is challenging and requires restrictive approximations. Monte Carlo Dropout has been widely used as a relatively cheap way for approximate Inference and to estimate uncertainty with deep neural networks. Traditionally, the dropout mask is sampled independently from a fixed distribution. Recent works show that the dropout mask can be viewed as a latent variable, which can be inferred with variational inference. These methods face two important challenges: (a) the posterior distribution over masks can be highly multi-modal which can be difficult to approximate with standard variational inference and (b) it is not trivial to fully utilize sample-dependent information and correlation among dropout masks to improve posterior estimation. In this work, we propose GFlowOut to address these issues. GFlowOut leverages the recently proposed probabilistic framework of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to learn the posterior distribution over dropout masks. We empirically demonstrate that GFlowOut results in predictive distributions that generalize better to out-of-distribution data, and provide uncertainty estimates which lead to better performance in downstream tasks.},

Towards enabling such reasoning capabilities in complex real-world tasks, Liu et al. (2022) propose to distill knowledge (through latent variable assignments) from less tractable but more expressive deep generative models. However, it is still unclear what factors make this distillation work well. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically discover that the performance of a PC can exceed that of its teacher model. Therefore, instead of performing distillation from the most expressive deep generative model, we study what properties the teacher model and the PC should have in order to achieve good distillation performance. This leads to a generic algorithmic improvement as well as other data-type-specific ones over the existing latent variable distillation pipeline. Empirically, we outperform SoTA TPMs by a large margin on challenging image modeling benchmarks. In particular, on ImageNet32, PCs achieve 4.06 bits-per-dimension, which is only 0.34 behind variational diffusion models (Kingma et al., 2021).},

  abstract     = {Weight oscillation is an undesirable side effect of quantization-aware training, in which quantized weights frequently jump between two quantized levels, resulting in training instability and a sub-optimal final model. We discover that the learnable scaling factor, a widely-used de facto setting in quantization aggravates weight oscillation. In this study, we investigate the connection between the learnable scaling factor and quantized weight oscillation and use ViT as a case driver to illustrate the findings and remedies. In addition, we also found that the interdependence between quantized weights in query and key of a self-attention layer makes ViT vulnerable to oscillation. We, therefore, propose three techniques accordingly: 1. Statistical weight quantization (StatsQ) to improve quantization robustness 2. Confidence-guided annealing (CGA) that freezes weights with high confidence and calms oscillating weights 3. Query-key reparameterization (QKR) to resolve query-key intertwined oscillation and mitigate gradient misestimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that these proposed techniques successfully abate weight oscillation and consistently achieve substantial accuracy improvement on ImageNet. Specifically, our 2-bit DeiT-T/DeiT-S algorithms outperform the previous state-of-the-art by 9.8% and 7.7%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In many real-world applications, graph-structured data used for training and testing have differences in distribution, such as in high energy physics (HEP) where simulation data used for training may not match real experiments. Graph domain adaptation (GDA) is a method used to address these differences. However, current GDA primarily works by aligning the distributions of node representations output by a single graph neural network encoder shared across the training and testing domains, which may often yield sub-optimal solutions. This work examines different impacts of distribution shifts caused by either graph structure or node attributes and identifies a new type of shift, named conditional structure shift (CSS), which current GDA approaches are provably sub-optimal to deal with. A novel approach, called structural reweighting (StruRW), is proposed to address this issue and is tested on synthetic graphs, four benchmark datasets, and a new application in HEP. StruRW has shown significant performance improvement over the baselines in the settings with large graph structure shifts, and reasonable performance improvement when node attribute shift dominates.},

  abstract     = {Gradient methods have become mainstream techniques for Bi-Level Optimization (BLO) in learning fields. The validity of existing works heavily rely on either a restrictive Lower-Level Strong Convexity (LLSC) condition or on solving a series of approximation subproblems with high accuracy or both. In this work, by averaging the upper and lower level objectives, we propose a single loop Bi-level Averaged Method of Multipliers (sl-BAMM) for BLO that is simple yet efficient for large-scale BLO and gets rid of the limited LLSC restriction. We further provide non-asymptotic convergence analysis of sl-BAMM towards KKT stationary points, and the comparative advantage of our analysis lies in the absence of strong gradient boundedness assumption, which is always required by others. Thus our theory safely captures a wider variety of applications in deep learning, especially where the upper-level objective is quadratic w.r.t. the lower-level variable. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method.},

  abstract     = {Dynamical systems with complex behaviours, e.g. immune system cells interacting with a pathogen, are commonly modelled by splitting the behaviour in different regimes, or modes, each with simpler dynamics, and then learn the switching behaviour from one mode to another. To achieve this, Switching Dynamical Systems (SDS) are a powerful tool that automatically discovers these modes and mode-switching behaviour from time series data. While effective, these methods focus on independent objects, where the modes of one object are independent of the modes of the other objects. In this paper, we focus on the more general interacting object setting for switching dynamical systems, where the per-object dynamics also depend on an unknown and dynamically changing subset of other objects and their modes. To this end, we propose GRAph Switching dynamical Systems (GRASS), in which we use a dynamic graph to characterize interactions between objects and learn both intra-object and inter-object mode-switching behaviour. We validate our approach on several synthetic datasets and demonstrate its efficacy on real-world datasets.},

This work reveals an overlooked dimension -- model schedule -- for optimizing the trade-off between generation quality and speed. We find that small models, though having worse generation quality when used alone, could outperform large models in certain generation steps. Based on this insight, we introduce OMS-DPM, a predictor-based search algorithm to find the optimal model schedule that maximizes generation quality under a given computational budget. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet, and LSUN demonstrate that OMS-DPM significantly improves both generation quality and speed compared to prior methods. When applied to Stable Diffusion, OMS-DPM achieves 2× acceleration while maintaining generation quality.},

Instead, we show high probability convergence with bounds depending on the initial distance to the optimal solution. The algorithms use step sizes analogous to the standard settings and are universal to Lipschitz functions, smooth functions, and their linear combinations. The method can be applied to the non-convex case. We demonstrate improved convergence rates: an O((1+σ²log(1/δ))/T+σ/√T) rate when T is known and an O((1+σ²log(T/δ))/√T) rate when T is unknown for SGD, where 1-δ is the desired success probability.},

We examine the causes and types of lazy agents using causal graph analysis of the interaction between agents and their environment. We mathematically define fully lazy agents and teams by calculating the causal effect of their actions on external states using the do-calculus process. Based on our definitions, we provide two intrinsic rewards to motivate agents: individual diligence intrinsic motivation (IDI) and collaborative diligence intrinsic motivation (CDI). IDI and CDI employ counterfactual reasoning based on the external states transition model (ESTM). Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging sparse reward benchmarks including SMAC and Google Research Football, helping both value-based and policy-based baselines avoid lazy agents for improved learning efficiency.},

We ask whether embodied reinforcement learning agents can indirectly learn language from non-language tasks. Learning to associate language with its meaning requires a dynamic environment with varied language. We investigate this in a multi-task environment with language that varies across different tasks. Specifically, we design an office navigation environment where the agent's goal is to find a particular office, and office locations differ in different buildings (i.e., tasks). Each building includes a floor plan with a simple language description of the goal office's location, which can be visually read as an RGB image when visited. We show that meta-reinforcement learning agents can learn to ground language and use it to guide their behavior in this environment.},

To address this limitation, we propose using genetic algorithms to generate private synthetic data. This approach allows us to optimize non-differentiable objectives, leading to more flexible and useful synthetic data generation. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets and tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality synthetic data under differential privacy constraints.},

We propose FusionRetro, a novel framework that utilizes context information for improved retrosynthetic planning by viewing synthetic routes as reaction graphs and incorporating context through three principled steps: encode molecules into embeddings, aggregate information over routes, and readout to predict reactants. This is the first attempt to utilize in-context learning for retrosynthesis prediction. The entire framework can be efficiently optimized end-to-end and produces more practical and accurate predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that by fusing in context information over routes, our model significantly improves retrosynthetic planning performance over baselines that are not context-aware, especially for long synthetic routes.},

TR0N learns a lightweight stochastic mapping which translates between the space of conditions and the latent space of the generative model, such that the generated latent corresponds to a data sample satisfying the desired condition. The translated latent samples are then further improved through Langevin dynamics, enabling higher-quality data samples. TR0N requires no training data nor fine-tuning, yet achieves a zero-shot FID of 10.9 on MS-COCO, outperforming competing alternatives not only on this metric but also in sampling speed while retaining much higher generality.},

However, they are computationally expensive at inference time. Sparsity is a natural approach to reduce this cost, but existing methods either require costly retraining, have to forgo {LLM}'s in-context learning ability, or do not yield wall-clock time speedup on modern hardware. We hypothesize that contextual sparsity, which are small, input-dependent sets of attention heads and {MLP} parameters that yield approximately the same output as the dense model for a given input, can address these issues. We show that contextual sparsity exists, that it can be accurately predicted, and that we can exploit it to speed up {LLM} inference in wall-clock time without compromising {LLM}'s quality or in-context learning ability. Based on these insights, we propose {DejaVu}, a system that uses a low-cost algorithm to predict contextual sparsity on the fly given inputs to each layer, along with an asynchronous and hardware-aware implementation that speeds up {LLM} inference. We validate that {DejaVu} can reduce the inference latency of {OPT}-175{B} by over 2× compared to the state-of-the-art {FasterTransformer}, and over 6× compared to the widely used {Hugging Face} implementation, without compromising model quality.

We argue and empirically validate that relevant methods are vulnerable to ambiguity attacks, where the forged watermarks can cast ambiguity over the ownership verification. The primary trait that distinguishes this work from previous ones, is its design of a bidirectional connection between watermarks and deep models. Thereby, {TdN} enables an irreversible ownership verification scheme that is difficult for the adversary to compromise. In this way, the proposed {TdN} can effectively defeat ambiguity attacks.

  abstract     = {Retrosynthesis, which aims to find a route to synthesize a target molecule from commercially available starting materials, is a critical task in drug discovery and materials design. Recently, the combination of {ML}-based single-step reaction predictors with multi-step planners has led to promising results. However, the single-step predictors are mostly trained offline to optimize the single-step accuracy, without considering complete routes. Here, we leverage reinforcement learning ({RL}) to improve the single-step predictor, by using a tree-shaped {MDP} to optimize complete routes. Specifically, we propose a novel online training algorithm, called Planning with Dual Value Networks ({PDVN}), which alternates between the planning phase and updating phase. In {PDVN}, we construct two separate value networks to predict the synthesizability and cost of molecules, respectively. To maintain the single-step accuracy, we design a two-branch network structure for the single-step predictor. On the widely-used {USPTO} dataset, our {PDVN} algorithm improves the search success rate of existing multi-step planners (e.g., increasing the success rate from 85.79\% to 98.95\% for Retro*, and reducing the number of model calls by half while solving 99.47\% molecules for {RetroGraph}). Additionally, {PDVN} helps find shorter synthesis routes (e.g., reducing the average route length from 5.76 to 4.83 for Retro*, and from 5.63 to 4.78 for {RetroGraph}).},

  abstract     = {Language modeling on large-scale datasets improves performance of various downstream tasks. The validation pre-training loss is often used as the evaluation metric for language models since the pre-training loss tends to be well-correlated with downstream performance (which is itself hard to evaluate comprehensively). Contrary to the conventional wisdom, this paper shows that 1) pre-training loss cannot fully explain downstream performance and 2) flatness of the model is well-correlated with downstream performance where pre-training loss is not. We identify three ways to produce models with the same pre-training loss but different downstream performance: continue pre-training after convergence, increasing the model size, and changing the pre-training algorithms. These experiments demonstrate the existence of implicit bias of pre-training algorithms---among models with the same minimal pre-training loss, they implicitly prefer more transferable ones. Toward understanding this implicit bias, we prove that {SGD} with standard mini-batch noise implicitly prefers flatter minima of pre-training loss in language models, and empirically observe a strong correlation between flatness (measured by the trace of Hessian) and downstream performance among models with the same pre-training loss. We also prove in a synthetic language setting that among models with the minimal pre-training loss, the flattest model transfers to downstream tasks.},

Exhaustive enumeration or traditional {Monte Carlo} methods for the entire input space can exhibit impractical sampling time, especially for high-dimensional inputs. To make such difficult sampling computationally feasible, in this paper, we propose a novel Gradient-based {Wang-Landau} ({GWL}) sampler. We first draw the connection between the output distribution of a {NN} and the density of states ({DOS}) of a physical system. Then, we renovate the classic sampler for the {DOS} problem, {Wang-Landau} algorithm, by replacing its random proposals with gradient-based {Monte Carlo} proposals. This way, our {GWL} sampler investigates the under-explored subsets of the input space much more efficiently. Extensive experiments have verified the accuracy of the output distribution generated by {GWL} and also showcased several interesting findings---for example, in a binary image classification task, both {CNN} and {ResNet} mapped the majority of human unrecognizable images to very negative logit values.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning ({RL}) has made significant strides in various complex domains. However, identifying an effective policy via {RL} often necessitates extensive exploration. Imitation learning aims to mitigate this issue by using expert demonstrations to guide exploration. In real-world scenarios, one often has access to multiple suboptimal black-box experts, rather than a single optimal oracle. These experts do not universally outperform each other across all states, presenting a challenge in actively deciding which oracle to use and in which state. We introduce {MAPS} and {MAPS-SE}, a class of policy improvement algorithms that perform imitation learning from multiple suboptimal oracles. In particular, {MAPS} actively selects which of the oracles to imitate and improve their value function estimates, and {MAPS-SE} additionally leverages an active state exploration criterion to determine which states one should explore.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving systems require High-Definition ({HD}) semantic maps to navigate around urban roads. Existing solutions approach the semantic mapping problem by offline manual annotation, which suffers from serious scalability issues. Recent learning-based methods produce dense rasterized segmentation predictions to construct maps. However, these predictions do not include instance information of individual map elements and require heuristic post-processing to obtain vectorized maps. To tackle these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end vectorized {HD} map learning pipeline, termed {VectorMapNet}. {VectorMapNet} takes onboard sensor observations and predicts a sparse set of polylines in the bird's-eye view. This pipeline can explicitly model the spatial relation between map elements and generate vectorized maps that are friendly to downstream autonomous driving tasks. Extensive experiments show that {VectorMapNet} achieve strong map learning performance on both {nuScenes} and {Argoverse2} dataset, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by 14.2 {mAP} and 14.6{mAP}. Qualitatively, {VectorMapNet} is capable of generating comprehensive maps and capturing fine-grained details of road geometry. To the best of our knowledge, {VectorMapNet} is the first work designed towards end-to-end vectorized map learning from onboard observations.},

This subroutine also achieves the state-of-the-art regret and constraint violation bounds for constrained online convex optimization problems, which is of independent interest. Our experiments demonstrate the proposed control algorithms are adaptive to adversarial constraints and achieve smaller cumulative costs and violations. Moreover, our algorithms are less conservative and achieve significantly smaller cumulative costs than the state-of-the-art algorithm.},

Despite significant interest, existing attacks remain relatively ineffective against modern machine learning architectures. In this work, we introduce the notion of model poisoning reachability as a technical tool to explore the intrinsic limits of data poisoning attacks towards target parameters (i.e., model-targeted attacks). We derive an easily computable threshold to establish and quantify a surprising phase transition phenomenon among popular {ML} models: data poisoning attacks can achieve certain target parameters only when the poisoning ratio exceeds our threshold. Building on existing parameter corruption attacks and refining the Gradient Canceling attack, we perform extensive experiments to confirm our theoretical findings, test the predictability of our transition threshold, and significantly improve existing indiscriminate data poisoning baselines over a range of datasets and models. Our work highlights the critical role played by the poisoning ratio, and sheds new insights on existing empirical results, attacks and mitigation strategies in data poisoning.},

  abstract     = {Recent innovations on hardware (e.g., {Nvidia} {A100}) have motivated learning {N:M} structured sparsity masks from scratch for fast model inference. However, state-of-the-art learning recipes in this regime (e.g., {SR-STE}) are proposed for non-adaptive optimizers like momentum {SGD}, while incurring non-trivial accuracy drop for Adam-trained models like attention-based {LLMs}. In this paper, we first demonstrate such gap origins from poorly estimated second moment (i.e., variance) in Adam states given by the masked weights. We conjecture that learning {N:M} masks with Adam should take the critical regime of variance estimation into account. In light of this, we propose {STEP}, an Adam-aware recipe that learns {N:M} masks with two phases: first, {STEP} calculates a reliable variance estimate (precondition phase) and subsequently, the variance remains fixed and is used as a precondition to learn {N:M} masks (mask-learning phase). {STEP} automatically identifies the switching point of two phases by dynamically sampling variance changes over the training trajectory and testing the sample concentration. Empirically, we evaluate {STEP} and other baselines such as {ASP} and {SR-STE} on multiple tasks including {CIFAR} classification, machine translation and {LLM} fine-tuning ({BERT-Base}, {GPT-2}). We show {STEP} mitigates the accuracy drop of baseline recipes and is robust to aggressive structured sparsity ratios.},

  abstract     = {Automatic quantum architecture search has been widely studied across disciplines with different implications. In this paper, beyond a particular domain, we formulate the quantum architecture search problem into two basic (and relatively even ideal) tasks: i) arbitrary quantum circuit regeneration given a target quantum circuit; ii) approximating an arbitrary unitary (oracle). The latter can be connected to the setting of various quantum machine learning tasks and other quantum architecture search applications. Based on these two tasks, we generate a public quantum architecture search benchmark including 900 random quantum circuits and 400 random unitary matrices which is still missing in the literature. We evaluate six baseline algorithms including brute force search, simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, reinforcement learning, hybrid algorithm, and differentiable algorithm as part of our benchmark. One characteristic of our proposed evaluation protocol on the basic tasks is that it deprives the domain-specific designs and techniques as used in existing quantum architecture search literature, making a unified evaluation possible and focusing on the vanilla search methods themselves without coupling with domain prior. In fact, the unitary approximation task could be algorithmically more difficult than the specific problems as it needs to explore the whole matrix space to fit the unitary. While specific tasks often only need to fit a partial observation of the unitary as the objective for search.},

Moreover, human sketch understanding goes beyond categorization---critically, it also entails understanding how individual elements within a sketch correspond to parts of the physical world it represents. What are the computational ingredients needed to support this ability? Towards answering this question, we make two contributions: first, we introduce a new sketch-photo correspondence benchmark, {PSC6k}, containing 150K annotations of 6250 sketch-photo pairs across 125 object categories, augmenting the existing Sketchy dataset with fine-grained correspondence metadata. Second, we propose a self-supervised method for learning dense correspondences between sketch-photo pairs, building upon recent advances in correspondence learning for pairs of photos. Our model uses a spatial transformer network to estimate the warp flow between latent representations of a sketch and photo extracted by a contrastive learning-based {ConvNet} backbone. We found that this approach outperformed several strong baselines and produced predictions that were quantitatively consistent with other warp-based methods. However, our benchmark also revealed systematic differences between predictions of the suite of models we tested and those of humans. Taken together, our work suggests a promising path towards developing artificial systems that achieve more human-like understanding of visual images at different levels of abstraction.},

We propose a weaker notion of partial exchangeability, better suited to the federated learning setting, and use it to develop the Federated Conformal Prediction framework. We show {FCP} enjoys rigorous theoretical guarantees and excellent empirical performance on several computer vision and medical imaging datasets.

We provide a definition of mechanistic similarity as shared invariances to input transformations and demonstrate that lack of linear connectivity between two models implies they use dissimilar mechanisms for making their predictions. Relevant to practice, this result helps us demonstrate that naive fine-tuning on a downstream dataset can fail to alter a model's mechanisms, e.g., fine-tuning can fail to eliminate a model's reliance on spurious attributes.},

Explaining such models would improve transparency and trust in {AI}-powered decision making and is necessary for understanding other practical needs such as robustness and fairness. A popular means of enhancing model transparency is to quantify how individual inputs contribute to model outputs (called attributions) and the magnitude of interactions between groups of inputs. A growing number of these methods import concepts and results from game theory to produce attributions and interactions. This work presents a unifying framework for game-theory-inspired attribution and $k$th-order interaction methods. We show that, given modest assumptions, a unique full account of interactions between features, called synergies, is possible in the continuous input setting. We identify how various methods are characterized by their policy of distributing synergies. We establish that gradient-based methods are characterized by their actions on monomials, a type of synergy function, and introduce unique gradient-based methods. We show that the combination of various criteria uniquely defines the attribution/interaction methods. Thus, the community needs to identify goals and contexts when developing and employing attribution and interaction methods.},

The pre-trained model can capture enriched visual concepts for images by learning from a large scale of text-image data. However, transferring the learned visual knowledge to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a {CLIP}-based model named {SegCLIP} for the topic of open-vocabulary segmentation in an annotation-free manner. The {SegCLIP} achieves segmentation based on {ViT} and the main idea is to gather patches with learnable centers to semantic regions through training on text-image pairs. The gathering operation can dynamically capture the semantic groups, which can be used to generate the final segmentation results. We further propose a reconstruction loss on masked patches and a superpixel-based {KL} loss with pseudo-labels to enhance the visual representation. Experimental results show that our model achieves comparable or superior segmentation accuracy on the {PASCAL} {VOC} 2012 (+0.3\% {mIoU}), {PASCAL} Context (+2.3\% {mIoU}), and {COCO} (+2.2\% {mIoU}) compared with baselines.},

  abstract     = {Leading graph ordinary differential equation ({ODE}) models have offered generalized strategies to model interacting multi-agent dynamical systems in a data-driven approach. They typically consist of a temporal graph encoder to get the initial states and a neural {ODE}-based generative model to model the evolution of dynamical systems. However, existing methods have severe deficiencies in capacity and efficiency due to the failure to model high-order correlations in long-term temporal trends. To tackle this, in this paper, we propose a novel model named High-order graph {ODE} ({HOPE}) for learning from dynamic interaction data, which can be naturally represented as a graph. It first adopts a twin graph encoder to initialize the latent state representations of nodes and edges, which consists of two branches to capture spatio-temporal correlations in complementary manners. More importantly, our {HOPE} utilizes a second-order graph {ODE} function which models the dynamics for both nodes and edges in the latent space respectively, which enables efficient learning of long-term dependencies from complex dynamical systems. Experiment results on a variety of datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.},

The {B}rownian motion controller offers {GAN}s global exponential stability by modeling the dynamics in the function space and providing effective methods to stabilize {GAN}s' training. We first analyze the training dynamic of a prototypical {D}irac {GAN} and adopt closed-loop control to improve its stability, then extend this approach to stabilize the training dynamic of normal {GAN}s.

This mapping between an input sample and network weights is approximated by a denoising diffusion model. The diffusion model we employ focuses on modifying a single layer of the base model and is conditioned on the input, activations, and output of this layer. Since the diffusion model is stochastic in nature, multiple initializations generate different networks, forming an ensemble, which leads to further improvements.

Deep neural networks are known to lose plasticity over the course of training even in relatively simple learning problems, but the mechanisms driving this phenomenon are still poorly understood. This paper conducts a systematic empirical analysis into plasticity loss, with the goal of understanding the phenomenon mechanistically in order to guide the future development of targeted solutions. We find that loss of plasticity is deeply connected to changes in the curvature of the loss landscape, but that it often occurs in the absence of saturated units. Based on this insight, we identify a number of parameterization and optimization design choices which enable networks to better preserve plasticity over the course of training. We validate the utility of these findings on larger-scale RL benchmarks in the Arcade Learning Environment.},

Instead of studying settings with limited non-stationarity, we investigate how online predictions on the total demand volume Q allows us to improve our performance guarantees. We show that, without any prediction, any online algorithm incurs a linear-in-T regret. In contrast, with online predictions on Q, we propose an online algorithm that judiciously incorporates the predictions, and achieve regret bounds that depends on the accuracy of the predictions. These bounds are shown to be tight in settings when prediction accuracy improves across time. Our theoretical results are corroborated by our numerical findings.},

In this work, we bring back the welfare objectives of ad auctions into CTR predictions and propose a novel weighted rankloss to train the CTR model. Compared to existing literature, our approach provides a provable guarantee on welfare but without assumptions on the eCPMs' distribution while also avoiding the intractability of naively applying existing learning-to-rank methods. Further, we propose a theoretically justifiable technique for calibrating the losses using labels generated from a teacher network, only assuming that the teacher network has bounded $\ell_2$ generalization error.},

In this paper, we thoroughly analyze these methods in a unified setup. In particular, we address the following questions. Is direct optimization of a smoothed ranking loss preferable over optimizing a convex surrogate? How to properly construct and smooth surrogate ranking losses? To address these questions, we compare LambdaMART with YetiRank and StochasticRank methods and their modifications. We also propose a simple improvement of the YetiRank approach that allows for optimizing specific ranking loss functions. As a result, we gain insights into learning-to-rank techniques and obtain a new state-of-the-art algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Transformers for graph data are increasingly widely studied and successful in numerous learning tasks. Graph inductive biases are crucial for Graph Transformers, and previous works incorporate them using message-passing modules and/or positional encodings. However, Graph Transformers that use message-passing inherit known issues of message-passing, and differ significantly from Transformers used in other domains, thus making transfer of research advances more difficult. On the other hand, Graph Transformers without message-passing often perform poorly on smaller datasets, where inductive biases are more crucial. To bridge this gap, we propose the Graph Inductive bias Transformer (GRIT) -- a new Graph Transformer that incorporates graph inductive biases without using message passing. GRIT is based on several architectural changes that are each theoretically and empirically justified, including: learned relative positional encodings initialized with random walk probabilities, a flexible attention mechanism that updates node and node-pair representations, and injection of degree information in each layer. We prove that GRIT is expressive -- it can express shortest path distances and various graph propagation matrices. GRIT achieves state-of-the-art empirical performance across a variety of graph datasets, thus showing the power that Graph Transformers without message-passing can deliver.},

Exploiting a novel connection between dual reinforcement learning and mutual information contrastive learning, the LIV objective trains a multi-modal representation that implicitly encodes a universal value function for tasks specified as language or image goals. We use LIV to pre-train the first control-centric vision-language representation from large human video datasets such as EpicKitchen. Given only a language or image goal, the pre-trained LIV model can assign dense rewards to each frame in videos of unseen robots or humans attempting that task in unseen environments. Further, when some target domain-specific data is available, the same objective can be used to fine-tune and improve LIV and even other pre-trained representations for robotic control and reward specification in that domain. In our experiments on several simulated and real-world robot environments, LIV models consistently outperform the best prior input state representations for imitation learning, as well as reward specification methods for policy synthesis. Our results validate the advantages of joint vision-language representation and reward learning within the unified, compact LIV framework.},

To overcome this challenge, we propose to learn SDFs via a noise to noise mapping, which does not require any clean point cloud or ground truth supervision for training. Our novelty lies in the noise to noise mapping which can infer a highly accurate SDF of a single object or scene from its multiple or even single noisy point cloud observations. Our novel learning manner is supported by modern Lidar systems which capture multiple noisy observations per second. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables statistical reasoning on point clouds and maintains geometric consistency although point clouds are irregular, unordered and have no point correspondence. Our evaluation under the widely used benchmarks demonstrates our superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in surface reconstruction, point cloud denoising and upsampling.},

This contrasts with the existing over-parametrization technique where the search rank is limited by the dimension of the matrix and it does not allow a rich over-parametrization of an arbitrary degree. We show that although the spurious solutions of the problem remain stationary points through the hierarchy, they will be transformed into strict saddle points (under some technical conditions) and can be escaped via local search methods.

Specifically, we find that the confidence estimated by current models could even increase when some modalities are corrupted. To address the issue, we introduce an intuitive principle for multimodal learning, i.e., the confidence should not increase when one modality is removed. Accordingly, we propose a novel regularization technique, i.e., Calibrating Multimodal Learning (CML) regularization, to calibrate the predictive confidence of previous methods.},

  abstract     = {Generative flow networks (GFlowNets) are a family of algorithms for training a sequential sampler of discrete objects under an unnormalized target density and have been successfully used for various probabilistic modeling tasks. Existing training objectives for GFlowNets are either local to states or transitions, or propagate a reward signal over an entire sampling trajectory. We argue that these alternatives represent opposite ends of a gradient bias-variance tradeoff and propose a way to exploit this tradeoff to mitigate its harmful effects. We introduce subtrajectory balance or SubTB(λ), a GFlowNet training objective that can learn from partial action subsequences of varying lengths. We show that SubTB(λ) accelerates sampler convergence in previously studied and new environments and enables training GFlowNets in environments with longer action sequences and sparser reward landscapes than what was possible before.},

We demonstrate how to more effectively utilize historical datasets and application domain knowledge by intentionally using predictors of different quantities.

  abstract     = {Geo-tagged images are publicly available in large quantities, whereas labels such as object classes are rather scarce and expensive to collect. Meanwhile, contrastive learning has achieved tremendous success in various natural image and language tasks with limited labeled data. However, existing methods fail to fully leverage geospatial information, which can be paramount to distinguishing objects that are visually similar. To directly leverage the abundant geospatial information associated with images in pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference stages, we present Contrastive Spatial Pre-Training (CSP), a self-supervised learning framework for geo-tagged images. We use a dual-encoder to separately encode the images and their corresponding geo-locations, and use contrastive objectives to learn effective location representations from images, which can be transferred to downstream supervised tasks such as image classification. Experiments show that CSP can improve model performance on both iNat2018 and fMoW datasets. Especially, on iNat2018, CSP significantly boosts the model performance with 10-34\% relative improvement with various labeled training data sampling ratios.},

We depart from previous literature by assuming no knowledge of the causal graph except that latent confounders between the outcome and its ancestors are not present. We first show that the unknown graph problem can be exponentially hard in the parents of the outcome. We adopt an additive assumption to address this challenge and propose a novel action-elimination algorithm for this setting. We show how to apply this algorithm to the causal bandit problem, provide sample complexity bounds, and empirically validate our findings on a suite of randomly generated causal models.},

Motivated by this, a significant line of work has formalized settings where an action's loss is a function of the number of times that action was recently played in the prior $m$ timesteps, where $m$ corresponds to a bound on human memory capacity. To more faithfully capture decay of human memory with time, we introduce the Weighted Tallying Bandit (WTB), which generalizes this setting by requiring that an action's loss is a function of a weighted summation of the number of times that arm was played in the last $m$ timesteps. This WTB setting is intractable without further assumption. So we study it under Repeated Exposure Optimality (REO), a condition motivated by the literature on human physiology, which requires the existence of an action that when repetitively played will eventually yield smaller loss than any other action sequence.},

We investigate whether the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) - which originated as a model to study the gradient descent dynamics of infinitely wide networks with suitable random initialization - describes fine-tuning of pre-trained LMs. This study was inspired by the decent performance of NTK for computer vision tasks. We extend the NTK formalism to Adam and use Tensor Programs to characterize conditions under which the NTK lens may describe fine-tuning updates to pre-trained language models.},

We then consider a regularized version of the reinforcement learning problem and show that repeatedly optimizing this objective converges to a performatively stable policy under reasonable assumptions on the transition dynamics. Our proof utilizes the dual perspective of the reinforcement learning problem and may be of independent interest in analyzing the convergence of other algorithms with decision-dependent environments. We then extend our results for the setting where the learner just performs gradient ascent steps instead of fully optimizing the objective, and for the setting where the learner has access to a finite number of trajectories from the changed environment. For both the settings, we leverage the dual formulation of performative reinforcement learning, and establish convergence to a stable solution. Finally, through extensive experiments on a grid-world environment, we demonstrate the dependence of convergence on various parameters e.g. regularization, smoothness, and the number of samples.},

For surrogate losses of these abstention loss functions, we give a series of H-consistency bounds for both the family of linear functions and that of neural networks with one hidden-layer.

Our theoretical results show the importance of having dense constraints at inference time.

We propose and examine eight alternative measures of data spread, all but one of which improve over these current metrics when applied to seven synthetic data distributions. Of our proposed measures, we recommend one principal component-based measure and one entropy-based measure that provide reliable, relative measures of spread and can be used to compare models of different sizes and dimensionalities.},

  abstract     = {We consider a cross-silo federated learning (FL) setting where a machine learning model with a fully connected first layer is trained between different clients and a central server using FedAvg, and where the aggregation step can be performed with secure aggregation (SA). We present SRATTA an attack relying only on aggregated models which, under realistic assumptions, (i) recovers data samples from the different clients, and (ii) groups data samples coming from the same client together. While sample recovery has already been explored in an FL setting, the ability to group samples per client, despite the use of SA, is novel. This poses a significant unforeseen security threat to FL and effectively breaks SA. We show that SRATTA is both theoretically grounded and can be used in practice on realistic models and datasets. We also propose counter-measures, and claim that clients should play an active role to guarantee their privacy during training.},

Our key observation is that neuro-symbolic tasks, although different, often share concepts whose semantics remains stable over time. Traditional approaches fall short: existing continual strategies ignore knowledge altogether, while stock neuro-symbolic architectures suffer from catastrophic forgetting. We show that leveraging prior knowledge by combining neuro-symbolic architectures with continual strategies does help avoid catastrophic forgetting, but also that doing so can yield models affected by reasoning shortcuts. These undermine the semantics of the acquired concepts, even when detailed prior knowledge is provided upfront and inference is exact, and in turn continual performance. To overcome these issues, we introduce cool, a COncept-level cOntinual Learning strategy tailored for neuro-symbolic continual problems that acquires high-quality concepts and remembers them over time.},

Unsupervised deep-learning methods have demonstrated impressive performance on benchmarks based on synthetic noise. However, no metrics exist to evaluate these methods in an unsupervised fashion. This is highly problematic for the many practical applications where ground-truth clean images are not available. In this work, we propose two novel metrics: the unsupervised mean squared error (MSE) and the unsupervised peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), which are computed using only noisy data. We provide a theoretical analysis of these metrics, showing that they are asymptotically consistent estimators of the supervised MSE and PSNR.},

Through a power analysis, we identify the region of reliability of a scoring rule - the set of practical conditions where it can be relied on to identify forecasting errors.

By identifying a correspondence between diffusion models and a well-known paradigm in cognitive science known as serial reproduction, whereby human agents iteratively observe and reproduce stimuli from memory, we show how the aforementioned properties of diffusion models can be explained as a natural consequence of this correspondence.},

The recent emergence of large language models such as GPT has created the need for new approaches to exploit data-parallelism. Among these, fully-sharded data parallel (FSDP) training is highly popular, yet it still encounters scalability bottlenecks. One reason is that applying compression techniques to FSDP is challenging: as the vast majority of the communication involves the model's weights, direct compression alters convergence and leads to accuracy loss. We present QSDP, a variant of FSDP which supports both gradient and weight quantization with theoretical guarantees, is simple to implement and has essentially no overheads. Experiments show that QSDP preserves model accuracy, while completely removing the communication bottlenecks of FSDP, providing end-to-end speedups of up to 2.2x.},

To build systems which can interact robustly in the real world, it is thus important to be able to infer the precise interactions governing such systems. Existing approaches typically discover such interactions by explicitly modeling the feed-forward dynamics of the trajectories. In this work, we propose Neural Interaction Inference with Potentials ({NIIP}) as an alternative approach to discover such interactions that enables greater flexibility in trajectory modeling: it discovers a set of relational potentials, represented as energy functions, which when minimized reconstruct the original trajectory. {NIIP} assigns low energy to the subset of trajectories which respect the relational constraints observed. We illustrate that with these representations {NIIP} displays unique capabilities in test-time. First, it allows trajectory manipulation, such as interchanging interaction types across separately trained models, as well as trajectory forecasting. Additionally, it allows adding external hand-crafted potentials at test-time. Finally, {NIIP} enables the detection of out-of-distribution samples and anomalies without explicit training.},

In this work, we are concerned with understanding how models behave as the type of modalities differ between training and deployment, a situation that naturally arises in many applications of multimodal learning to hardware platforms. We present a multimodal robustness framework to provide a systematic analysis of common multimodal representation learning methods. Further, we identify robustness short-comings of these approaches and propose two intervention techniques leading to $1.5\times$--$4\times$ robustness improvements on three datasets, AudioSet, Kinetics-400 and ImageNet-Captions.},

In experiments on image classification and machine translation tasks, we investigate how much we can simplify the network function towards linearity before performance collapses. First, we observe a significant performance gap when reducing nonlinearity in the network function early on as opposed to late in training, in-line with recent observations on the time-evolution of the data-dependent {NTK}. Second, we find that after training, we are able to linearize a significant number of nonlinear units while maintaining a high performance, indicating that much of a network's expressivity remains unused but helps gradient descent in early stages of training.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the effect of a feature vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^d$ on the response value (label) $y\in \mathbb{R}$ is the cornerstone of many statistical learning problems. Ideally, it is desired to understand how a set of collected features combine together and influence the response value, but this problem is notoriously difficult, due to the high-dimensionality of data and limited number of labeled data points, among many others. In this work, we take a new perspective on this problem, and we study the question of assessing the difference of influence that the two given features have on the response value. We first propose a notion of closeness for the influence of features, and show that our definition recovers the familiar notion of the magnitude of coefficients in the parametric model. We then propose a novel method to test for the closeness of influence in general model-free supervised learning problems. Our proposed test can be used with finite number of samples with control on type I error rate, no matter the ground truth conditional law $\mathcal{L}(Y|X)$. We analyze the power of our test for two general learning problems i) linear regression, and ii) binary classification under mixture of Gaussian models, and show that under the proper choice of score function, an internal component of our test, with sufficient number of samples will achieve full statistical power. We evaluate our findings through extensive numerical simulations, specifically we adopt the datamodel framework for {CIFAR}-10 dataset to identify pairs of training samples with different influence on the trained model via optional black box training mechanisms.},

Remarkably, global convergence of the stochastic gradient bandit algorithm has not been previously established, even though it is an old algorithm known to be applicable to bandits. The new result is achieved by establishing two novel technical findings: first, the noise of the stochastic updates in the gradient bandit algorithm satisfies a strong ``growth condition'' property, where the variance diminishes whenever progress becomes small, implying that additional noise control via diminishing step sizes is unnecessary; second, a form of ``weak exploration'' is automatically achieved through the stochastic gradient updates, since they prevent the action probabilities from decaying faster than $O(1/t)$, thus ensuring that every action is sampled infinitely often with probability 1.},

Although the stochastic subgradient method (SGM) is a natural choice for minimizing the CVaR objective, we show that our stochastic prox-linear (SPL+) algorithm can better exploit the structure of the objective, while still providing a convenient closed form update. Our SPL+ method also adapts to the scaling of the loss function, which allows for easier tuning. We then specialize a general convergence theorem for SPL+ to our setting, and show that it allows for a wider selection of step sizes compared to SGM. We support this theoretical finding experimentally.},

Despite their promising performance, most existing few-shot approaches that only learn from the small training set still underperform fully supervised training by nontrivial margins. In this work, we study few-shot learning with PLMs from a different perspective: We first tune an autoregressive PLM on the few-shot samples and then use it as a generator to synthesize a large amount of novel training samples which augment the original training set. To encourage the generator to produce label discriminative samples, we train it via weighted maximum likelihood where the weight of each token is automatically adjusted based on a discriminative meta-learning objective. A classification PLM can then be fine-tuned on both the few-shot and the synthetic samples with regularization for better generalization and stability. Our approach FewGen achieves an overall better result across seven classification tasks of the GLUE benchmark than existing few-shot learning methods, improving no-augmentation methods by 5+ average points, and outperforming augmentation methods by 3+ average points.},

In both cases, we design algorithms that achieve sublinear excess cost, compared to the performance with known types, and prove lower bounds for the non-preemptive case. Notably, we demonstrate, both theoretically and through simulations, how preemptive algorithms can greatly outperform non-preemptive ones when the durations of different job types are far from one another, a phenomenon that does not occur when the type durations are known.},

In this paper, we make a step towards closing the theory gap of IRL in the case of finite-horizon problems with a generative model.

In general, scientists and engineers solve PDEs numerically by the use of computationally demanding solvers. Recently, deep learning algorithms have emerged as a viable alternative for obtaining fast solutions for PDEs. Models are usually trained on synthetic data generated by solvers, stored on disk and read back for training. This paper advocates that relying on a traditional static dataset to train these models does not allow the full benefit of the solver to be used as a data generator. It proposes an open source online training framework for deep surrogate models. The framework implements several levels of parallelism focused on simultaneously generating numerical simulations and training deep neural networks. This approach suppresses the I/O and storage bottleneck associated with disk-loaded datasets, and opens the way to training on significantly larger datasets. Results indicate that exposing deep surrogate models to more dataset diversity, up to hundreds of GB, can increase model generalization capabilities. Fully connected neural networks, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and Message Passing PDE Solver prediction accuracy is improved by 68%, 16% and 7%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), independent learning (IL) often shows remarkable performance and easily scales with the number of agents. Yet, using IL can be inefficient and runs the risk of failing to successfully train, particularly in scenarios that require agents to coordinate their actions. Using centralised learning (CL) enables MARL agents to quickly learn how to coordinate their behaviour but employing CL everywhere is often prohibitively expensive in real-world applications. Besides, using CL in value-based methods often needs strong representational constraints (e.g. individual-global-max condition) that can lead to poor performance if violated. In this paper, we introduce a novel plug & play IL framework named Multi-Agent Network Selection Algorithm (MANSA) which selectively employs CL only at states that require coordination. At its core, MANSA has an additional agent that uses switching controls to quickly learn the best states to activate CL during training, using CL only where necessary and vastly reducing the computational burden of CL. Our theory proves MANSA preserves cooperative MARL convergence properties, boosts IL performance and can optimally make use of a fixed budget on the number CL calls. We show empirically in Level-based Foraging (LBF) and StarCraft Multi-agent Challenge (SMAC) that MANSA achieves fast, superior and more reliable performance while making 40% fewer CL calls in SMAC and using CL at only 1% CL calls in LBF.},

  abstract     = {We study the design of sample-efficient algorithms for reinforcement learning in the presence of rich, high-dimensional observations, formalized via the Block MDP problem. Existing algorithms suffer from either 1) computational intractability, 2) strong statistical assumptions that are not necessarily satisfied in practice, or 3) suboptimal sample complexity. We address these issues by providing the first computationally efficient algorithm that attains rate-optimal sample complexity with respect to the desired accuracy level, with minimal statistical assumptions. Our algorithm, MusIK, combines systematic exploration with representation learning based on multi-step inverse kinematics, a learning objective in which the aim is to predict the learner's own action from the current observation and observations in the (potentially distant) future. MusIK is simple and flexible, and can efficiently take advantage of general-purpose function approximation. Our analysis leverages several new techniques tailored to non-optimistic exploration algorithms, which we anticipate will find broader use.},

  abstract     = {Zero-order (ZO) optimization is a powerful tool for dealing with realistic constraints. On the other hand, the gradient-tracking (GT) technique proved to be an efficient method for distributed optimization aiming to achieve consensus. However, it is a first-order (FO) method that requires knowledge of the gradient, which is not always possible in practice. In this work, we introduce a zero-order distributed optimization method based on a one-point estimate of the gradient tracking technique. We prove that this new technique converges with a single noisy function query at a time in the non-convex setting. We then establish a convergence rate of O(1/K^{1/3}) after a number of iterations K, which competes with that of O(1/K^{1/4}) of its centralized counterparts. Finally, a numerical example validates our theoretical results.},

Previous methods for learning augmentations have typically assumed independence between the original input and the transformation applied to that input. This can be highly restrictive, as the invariances we hope our augmentation will capture are themselves often highly input dependent. InstaAug instead introduces a learnable invariance module that maps from inputs to tailored transformation parameters, allowing local invariances to be captured. This can be simultaneously trained alongside the downstream model in a fully end-to-end manner, or separately learned for a pre-trained model. We empirically demonstrate that InstaAug learns meaningful input-dependent augmentations for a wide range of transformation classes, which in turn provides better performance on both supervised and self-supervised tasks.},

Prior work has shed light into their potential, but also their limitations. Unfortunately, it was shown that standard GNNs are limited in their expressive power. These models are no more powerful than the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) algorithm in terms of distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs. In this paper, we propose Path Neural Networks (PathNNs), a model that updates node representations by aggregating paths emanating from nodes. We derive three different variants of the PathNN model that aggregate single shortest paths, all shortest paths and all simple paths of length up to K. We prove that two of these variants are strictly more powerful than the 1-WL algorithm, and we experimentally validate our theoretical results. We find that PathNNs can distinguish pairs of non-isomorphic graphs that are indistinguishable by 1-WL, while our most expressive PathNN variant can even distinguish between 3-WL indistinguishable graphs. The different PathNN variants are also evaluated on graph classification and graph regression datasets, where in most cases, they outperform the baseline methods.},

While many meta-learning algorithms can design agents that autonomously learn new tasks, cognitive tasks adds another level of learning and memory to typical "learning-to-learn" problems. Here we evolve neural networks, endowed with plastic connections and neuromodulation, over a sizable set of simple cognitive tasks adapted from a computational neuroscience framework. The resulting evolved networks can automatically modify their own connectivity to acquire a novel simple cognitive task, never seen during evolution, from stimuli and rewards alone, through the spontaneous operation of their evolved neural organization and plasticity system. Our results emphasize the importance of carefully considering the multiple learning loops involved in the emergence of intelligent behavior.},

Current architectures are bottlenecked because they fail to effectively capture the hierarchical processing of visual stimuli that takes place in the human brain. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel neural network architecture for neural decoding that uses Hierarchical Variational Autoencoders (HVAEs) to learn meaningful representations of natural images and leverages their latent space hierarchy to learn voxel-to-image mappings. By mapping the early stages of the visual pathway to the first set of latent variables and the higher visual cortex areas to the deeper layers in the latent hierarchy, we construct a latent variable neural decoding model that replicates hierarchical visual information processing. The proposed framework provides a new way of bridging the domain gap between fMRI signals and visual images, addressing the challenges of limited fMRI data instances that suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio and extremely high dimensionality.},

Neural stochastic differential equations ({Neural} {SDEs}), treated as infinite-dimensional {GANs}, have demonstrated successful performance mainly in generating unimodal time series data. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel time series generator, named directed chain {GANs} ({DC-GANs}), which inserts a time series dataset (called a neighborhood process of the directed chain or input) into the drift and diffusion coefficients of the directed chain {SDEs} with distributional constraints. {DC-GANs} can generate new time series of the same distribution as the neighborhood process, and the neighborhood process provides the key step in learning and generating multimodal distributed time series. We examine {DC-GANs} on four datasets, including two stochastic models from social sciences and computational neuroscience, and two real-world datasets on stock prices and energy consumption. To our knowledge, {DC-GANs} are the first work that can generate multimodal time series data and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks with respect to measures of distribution, data similarity, and predictive ability.},

The convergence rate depends on two trajectory-specific quantities controlled by weight initialization: the imbalance matrices (which measure the difference between the weights of adjacent layers) and the least singular value of the weight product $W=W_1W_2\cdots W_L$. Our analysis exploits the fact that the gradient of the overparameterized loss can be written as the composition of the non-overparameterized gradient with a time-varying (weight-dependent) linear operator whose smallest eigenvalue controls the convergence rate.},

Our analysis provides several practical contributions: an optimal pruning algorithm that can be used to compute minimal models -- the smallest-width neural networks which are optimal for a given dataset and regularization parameter.

We develop Pruning via Sparsity-indexed {ODE} ({PSO}), a pruning algorithm that enables effective pruning by traveling along the {SpODE} path.},

Based on this finding, we propose text-to-concept, where features from a fixed pretrained model are aligned linearly to the {CLIP} space, so that text embeddings from {CLIP}'s text encoder become directly comparable to the aligned features. With text-to-concept, we convert fixed off-the-shelf vision encoders to surprisingly strong zero-shot classifiers for free, with accuracy at times even surpassing that of {CLIP}, despite being much smaller models and trained on a small fraction of the data compared to {CLIP}. We demonstrate other immediate use-cases of text-to-concept, like building concept bottleneck models with no concept supervision, diagnosing distribution shifts in terms of human concepts, and retrieving images satisfying a set of text-based constraints.},

  abstract     = {Empirical neural tangent kernels (eNTKs) can provide a good understanding of a given network's representation: they are often far less expensive to compute and applicable more broadly than infinite width NTKs. For networks with O output units (e.g. an O-class classifier), however, the eNTK on N inputs is of size NO × NO, taking O((NO)²) memory and up to O((NO)³) computation. Most existing applications have therefore used one of a handful of approximations yielding N × N kernel matrices, saving orders of magnitude of computation, but with limited to no justification. We prove that one such approximation, which we call "sum of logits", converges to the true eNTK at initialization for any network with a wide final "readout" layer. Our experiments demonstrate the quality of this approximation for various uses across a range of settings.},

  abstract     = {When training neural networks, it has been widely observed that a large step size is essential in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for obtaining superior models. However, the effect of large step sizes on the success of SGD is not well understood theoretically. Several previous works have attributed this success to the stochastic noise present in SGD. However, we show through a novel set of experiments that the stochastic noise is not sufficient to explain good non-convex training, and that instead the effect of a large learning rate itself is essential for obtaining best performance. We demonstrate the same effects also in the noise-less case, i.e. for full-batch GD. We formally prove that GD with large step size —on certain non-convex function classes — follows a different trajectory than GD with a small step size, which can lead to convergence to a global minimum instead of a local one.},

This can limit the generalizability of acquired deductive reasoning ability. We rethink this and adopt a well-grounded set of deduction rules based on formal logic theory, which can derive any other deduction rules when combined in a multistep way. We empirically verify that LMs trained on the proposed corpora, which we name FLD (Formal Logic Deduction), acquire more generalizable deductive reasoning ability. Furthermore, we identify the aspects of deductive reasoning ability on which deduction corpora can enhance LMs and those on which they cannot. Finally, on the basis of these results, we discuss the future directions for applying deduction corpora or other approaches for each aspect. We release the code, data, and models.},

Such applications often require to put constraints on the agent's behavior. Existing algorithms for constrained RL (CRL) rely on gradient descent-ascent, but this approach comes with a caveat. While these algorithms are guaranteed to converge on average, they do not guarantee last-iterate convergence, i.e., the current policy of the agent may never converge to the optimal solution. In practice, it is often observed that the policy alternates between satisfying the constraints and maximizing the reward, rarely accomplishing both objectives simultaneously. Here, we address this problem by introducing Reinforcement Learning with Optimistic Ascent-Descent (ReLOAD), a principled CRL method with guaranteed last-iterate convergence. We demonstrate its empirical effectiveness on a wide variety of CRL problems including discrete MDPs and continuous control.},

Previous work has leveraged adversarial discriminators to improve statistical fidelity. Yet these binary discriminators adopted from generative modeling tasks may not be ideal for image compression.

GibbsDDRM constructs a joint distribution of the data, measurements, and linear operator by using a pre-trained diffusion model for the data prior, and it solves the problem by posterior sampling with an efficient variant of a Gibbs sampler. The proposed method is problem-agnostic, meaning that a pre-trained diffusion model can be applied to various inverse problems without fine-tuning.

This is typically cast as information retrieval: an unknown spectrum is matched against spectra predicted computationally from a large database of chemical structures. However, current approaches to spectrum prediction model the output space in ways that force a tradeoff between capturing high resolution mass information and tractable learning. We resolve this tradeoff by casting spectrum prediction as a mapping from an input molecular graph to a probability distribution over chemical formulas. We further discover that a large corpus of mass spectra can be closely approximated using a fixed vocabulary constituting only 2\% of all observed formulas. This enables efficient spectrum prediction using an architecture similar to graph classification - {G}r{AFF}-{MS} - achieving significantly lower prediction error and orders-of-magnitude faster runtime than state-of-the-art methods.},

For instance, in online advertising, investing in a platform produces an instantaneous increase of awareness, but the actual reward, i.e., a conversion, might occur far in the future. Furthermore, whether a conversion takes place depends on: how fast the awareness grows, its vanishing effects, and the synergy or interference with other advertising platforms. Previous work has investigated the Multi-Armed Bandit framework with the possibility of delayed and aggregated feedback, without a particular structure on how an action propagates in the future, disregarding possible dynamical effects.

  abstract     = {This work introduces DADAO: the first decentralized, accelerated, asynchronous, primal, first-order algorithm to minimize a sum of L-smooth and μ-strongly convex functions distributed over a given network of size n. Our key insight is based on modeling the local gradient updates and gossip communication procedures with separate independent Poisson Point Processes. This allows us to decouple the computation and communication steps, which can be run in parallel, while making the whole approach completely asynchronous. This leads to communication acceleration compared to synchronous approaches. Our new method employs primal gradients and does not use a multi-consensus inner loop nor other ad-hoc mechanisms such as Error Feedback, Gradient Tracking, or a Proximal operator.},

Under the assumption that the reward matrix of the N users has a low-rank structure -- a standard and practically successful assumption in the collaborative filtering setting -- we design algorithms with significantly lower sample complexity compared to the ones that learn the MDP individually for each user. Our main contribution is an algorithm which explores rewards collaboratively with N user-specific MDPs and can learn rewards efficiently in two key settings: tabular MDPs and linear MDPs. When N is large and the rank is constant, the sample complexity per MDP depends logarithmically over the size of the state-space, which represents an exponential reduction (in the state-space size) when compared to the standard non-collaborative approach.},

Instead of training the network to an observed training set, a fixed model is pre-trained offline on small, simulated training sets from a variety of tasks. The pre-trained model is then used to infer class probabilities in-context on fresh training sets with arbitrary size and distribution. Empirically, PFNs achieve state-of-the-art performance on tasks with similar size to the ones used in pre-training. Surprisingly, their accuracy further improves when passed larger data sets during inference. This article establishes a theoretical foundation for PFNs and illuminates the statistical mechanisms governing their behavior. While PFNs are motivated by Bayesian ideas, a purely frequentistic interpretation of PFNs as pre-tuned, but untrained predictors explains their behavior.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning models can make critical errors that are easily hidden within vast amounts of data. Such errors often run counter to rules based on human intuition. However, rules based on human knowledge are challenging to scale or to even formalize. We thereby seek to infer statistical rules from the data and quantify the extent to which a model has learned them. We propose a framework SQRL that integrates logic-based methods with statistical inference to derive these rules from a model's training data without supervision. We further show how to adapt models at test time to reduce rule violations and produce more coherent predictions. SQRL generates up to 300K rules over datasets from vision, tabular, and language settings. We uncover up to 158K violations of those rules by state-of-the-art models for classification, object detection, and data imputation. Test-time adaptation reduces these violations by up to 68.7\% with relative performance improvement up to 32\%.},

Recently, self-supervised techniques achieved impressive results in the sequential setting, where data is time-dependent. However, the latter methods employ modality-based data augmentations and random sampling or solve auxiliary tasks. In this work, we propose to avoid that by generating, sampling, and comparing empirical distributions from the underlying variational model. Unlike existing work, we introduce a self-supervised sequential disentanglement framework based on contrastive estimation with no external signals, while using common batch sizes and samples from the latent space itself. In practice, we propose a unified, efficient, and easy-to-code sampling strategy for semantically similar and dissimilar views of the data.

We compare our approach with state-of-the-art techniques alongside other ablations and show competitive performance in both stationary and non-stationary settings. Finally, we also investigate the discovered general value functions and through qualitative analysis show that the learn representations are not only interpretable but also, centered around objects that are invariant to changes across tasks facilitating fast adaptation.},

MBMA addresses issues associated with existing implementations of many-actions SPG and yields lower bias and comparable variance to SPG estimated from states in model-simulated rollouts. We find that MBMA bias and variance structure matches that predicted by theory. As a result, MBMA achieves improved sample efficiency and higher returns on a range of continuous action environments as compared to model-free, many-actions, and model-based on-policy SPG baselines.},

Unfortunately, the unique symmetry structure of deep weight spaces makes this design very challenging. If successful, such architectures would be capable of performing a wide range of intriguing tasks, from adapting a pre-trained network to a new domain to editing objects represented as functions (INRs or NeRFs). As a first step towards this goal, we present here a novel network architecture for learning in deep weight spaces. It takes as input a concatenation of weights and biases of a pre-trained MLP and processes it using a composition of layers that are equivariant to the natural permutation symmetry of the MLP's weights: Changing the order of neurons in intermediate layers of the MLP does not affect the function it represents. We provide a full characterization of all affine equivariant and invariant layers for these symmetries and show how these layers can be implemented using three basic operations: pooling, broadcasting, and fully connected layers applied to the input in an appropriate manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our architecture and its advantages over natural baselines in a variety of learning tasks.},

In order to better understand the systems under observation, we would like to learn a model of the underlying process that allows us to propagate samples in time and thereby simulate entire individual trajectories. In this work, we propose Action Matching, a method for learning a rich family of dynamics using only independent samples from its time evolution. We derive a tractable training objective, which does not rely on explicit assumptions about the underlying dynamics and does not require back-propagation through differential equations or optimal transport solvers. Inspired by connections with optimal transport, we derive extensions of Action Matching to learn stochastic differential equations and dynamics involving creation and destruction of probability mass.},

The key idea of the proposed method is to partition the non-exchangeable Markovian data from the HMM into exchangeable blocks by exploiting the de Finetti's Theorem for Markov Chains discovered by Diaconis and Freedman (1980). The permutations of the exchangeable blocks are viewed as randomizations of the observed Markovian data from the HMM. The proposed method provably retains all desirable theoretical guarantees offered by the classical conformal prediction framework in both exchangeable and Markovian settings.},

These approaches aim to model the non-linear dynamics and complex interactions between multiple variables, which are challenging to approximate. Additionally, many such numerical models are computationally intensive, especially when modeling the atmospheric phenomenon at a fine-grained spatial and temporal resolution. Recent data-driven approaches based on machine learning instead aim to directly solve a downstream forecasting or projection task by learning a data-driven functional mapping using deep neural networks. However, these networks are trained using curated and homogeneous climate datasets for specific spatiotemporal tasks, and thus lack the generality of numerical models. We develop and demonstrate ClimaX, a flexible and generalizable deep learning model for weather and climate science that can be trained using heterogeneous datasets spanning different variables, spatiotemporal coverage, and physical groundings. ClimaX extends the Transformer architecture with novel encoding and aggregation blocks that allow effective use of available compute and data while maintaining general utility. ClimaX is pre-trained with a self-supervised learning objective on climate datasets derived from CMIP6. The pre-trained ClimaX can then be fine-tuned to address a breadth of climate and weather tasks, including those that involve atmospheric variables and spatio-temporal scales unseen during pretraining. Compared to existing data-driven baselines, we show that this generality in ClimaX results in superior performance on benchmarks for weather forecasting and climate projections, even when pretrained at lower resolutions and compute budgets.},

One key challenge is that typical RL algorithms heavily rely on a reset mechanism to sample proper initial states; these reset mechanisms, in practice, are expensive to implement due to the need for human intervention or heavily engineered environments. To make learning more practical, we propose a generic no-regret reduction to systematically design reset-free RL algorithms. Our reduction turns the reset-free RL problem into a two-player game. We show that achieving sublinear regret in this two-player game would imply learning a policy that has both sublinear performance regret and sublinear total number of resets in the original RL problem. This means that the agent eventually learns to perform optimally and avoid resets. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this reduction, we design an instantiation for linear Markov decision processes, which is the first provably correct reset-free RL algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) had been demonstrated to be inherently susceptible to the problems of over-smoothing and over-squashing. These issues prohibit the ability of GNNs to model complex graph interactions by limiting their effectiveness in taking into account distant information. Our study reveals the key connection between the local graph geometry and the occurrence of both of these issues, thereby providing a unified framework for studying them at a local scale using the Ollivier-Ricci curvature. Specifically, we demonstrate that over-smoothing is linked to positive graph curvature while over-squashing is linked to negative graph curvature. Based on our theory, we propose the Batch Ollivier-Ricci Flow, a novel rewiring algorithm capable of simultaneously addressing both over-smoothing and over-squashing.},

  abstract     = {The recent integration of deep learning and pairwise similarity annotation-based constrained clustering -- i.e., deep constrained clustering (DCC) -- has proven effective for incorporating weak supervision into massive data clustering: Less than 1\% of pair similarity annotations can often substantially enhance the clustering accuracy. However, beyond empirical successes, there is a lack of understanding of DCC. In addition, many DCC paradigms are sensitive to annotation noise, but performance-guaranteed noisy DCC methods have been largely elusive. This work first takes a deep look into a recently emerged logistic loss function of DCC, and characterizes its theoretical properties. Our result shows that the logistic DCC loss ensures the identifiability of data membership under reasonable conditions, which may shed light on its effectiveness in practice. Building upon this understanding, a new loss function based on geometric factor analysis is proposed to fend against noisy annotations. It is shown that even under unknown annotation confusions, the data membership can still be provably identified under our proposed learning criterion. The proposed approach is tested over multiple datasets to validate our claims.},

  abstract     = {Max sliced Wasserstein (Max-SW) distance has been widely known as a solution for less discriminative projections of sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance. In applications that have various independent pairs of probability measures, amortized projection optimization is utilized to predict the ``max'' projecting directions given two input measures instead of using projected gradient ascent multiple times. Despite being efficient, Max-SW and its amortized version cannot guarantee metricity property due to the sub-optimality of the projected gradient ascent and the amortization gap. Therefore, we propose to replace Max-SW with distributional sliced Wasserstein distance with von Mises-Fisher (vMF) projecting distribution (v-DSW). Since v-DSW is a metric with any non-degenerate vMF distribution, its amortized version can guarantee the metricity when performing amortization. Furthermore, current amortized models are not permutation invariant and symmetric. To address the issue, we design amortized models based on self-attention architecture. In particular, we adopt efficient self-attention architectures to make the computation linear in the number of supports. With the two improvements, we derive self-attention amortized distributional projection optimization and show its appealing performance in point-cloud reconstruction and its downstream applications.},

Recently, by applying the theory of gyrogroups and gyrovector spaces that is a powerful framework for studying hyperbolic geometry, some works have attempted to build principled generalizations of Euclidean neural networks on matrix manifolds. However, due to the lack of many concepts in gyrovector spaces for the considered manifolds, e.g., the inner product and gyroangles, techniques and mathematical tools provided by these works are still limited compared to those developed for studying hyperbolic geometry. In this paper, we generalize some notions in gyrovector spaces for SPD and Grassmann manifolds, and propose new models and layers for building neural networks on these manifolds. We show the effectiveness of our approach in two applications, i.e., human action recognition and knowledge graph completion.},

In this work, we propose a simple post-processing framework to disentangle content and style in learned representations from pre-trained vision models. We model the pre-trained features probabilistically as linearly entangled combinations of the latent content and style factors and develop a simple disentanglement algorithm based on the probabilistic model. We show that the method provably disentangles content and style features and verify its efficacy empirically. Our post-processed features yield significant domain generalization performance improvements when the distribution shift occurs due to style changes or style-related spurious correlations.},

State-of-the-art approaches in this area combine LLM decoding with sample pruning and reranking using test cases or heuristics based on the execution results. However, it is challenging to obtain test cases for many real-world language-to-code applications, and heuristics cannot well capture the semantic features of the execution results, such as data type and value range, which often indicates the correctness of the program. In this work, we propose LEVER, a simple approach to improve language-to-code generation by learning to verify the generated programs with their execution results. Specifically, we train verifiers to determine whether a program sampled from the LLMs is correct or not based on the natural language input, the program itself and its execution results. The sampled programs are reranked by combining the verification score with the LLM generation probability, and marginalizing over programs with the same execution results. On four datasets across the domains of table QA, math QA and basic Python programming, LEVER consistently improves over the base code LLMs (4.6\% to 10.9\% with code-davinci-002) and achieves new state-of-the-art results on all of them.},

However, these works mostly lack the generalization ability across tasks with reward or dynamics change. To tackle this challenge, in this paper we propose a task-oriented conditioned diffusion planner for offline meta-RL (MetaDiffuser), which considers the generalization problem as conditional trajectory generation task with contextual representation. The key is to learn a context conditioned diffusion model which can generate task-oriented trajectories for planning across diverse tasks. To enhance the dynamics consistency of the generated trajectories while encouraging trajectories to achieve high returns, we further design a dual-guided module in the sampling process of the diffusion model. The experiment results on MuJoCo benchmarks show that MetaDiffuser outperforms other strong offline meta-RL baselines, demonstrating the outstanding conditional generation ability of diffusion architecture.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale multi-modal contrastive learning frameworks like CLIP typically require a large amount of image-text samples for training. However, these samples are always collected continuously in real scenarios. This paper discusses the feasibility of continual CLIP training using streaming data. Unlike continual learning based on self-supervised learning methods for pure images, which is empirically robust against catastrophic forgetting, CLIP's performance degeneration in the continual setting is significant and non-neglectable. By analyzing the changes in the model's representation space during continual CLIP training from a spatial geometry perspective, we explore and summarize these spatial variations as Spatial Disorder (SD), which can be divided into Intra-modal Rotation and Inter-modal Deviation. Moreover, we empirically and theoretically demonstrate how SD leads to a performance decline for CLIP on cross-modal retrieval tasks. To alleviate SD, we propose a new continual vision-language representation learning framework Mod-X: Maintain off-diagonal information-matriX. By selectively aligning the off-diagonal information distribution of contrastive matrices, the Mod-X improves the capability of the multi-modal model by maintaining the multi-modal representation space alignment on the old data domain during continuously fitting the new training data domain. Experiments on commonly used datasets with different scales and scopes have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.},

This paper investigates the use of latent semantic dimensions as fingerprints, from where we can analyze the effects of design variables, including the choice of fingerprinting dimensions, strength, and capacity, on the accuracy-quality tradeoff. Compared with previous SOTA, our method requires minimum computation and is more applicable to large-scale models.},

It can solve a wide array of image/video-specific manipulation tasks. In particular, our model can learn from few frames the motion and dynamics of a single input video.

To alleviate this problem, we propose a very simple but effective training regularization, consisting in perturbing the ground truth samples to simulate the inference time prediction errors.

We propose using few-shot large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize an AWM, that will be verified through world experience, to improve sample efficiency of RL agents. Our DECKARD agent applies LLM-guided exploration to item crafting in Minecraft in two phases: (1) the Dream phase where the agent uses an LLM to decompose a task into a sequence of subgoals, the hypothesized AWM; and (2) the Wake phase where the agent learns a modular policy for each subgoal and verifies or corrects the hypothesized AWM. In both phases, the agent's policy can condition on language instructions and historical context.},

  abstract     = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved great success in solving difficult tasks across many domains, but such success comes with a high computation cost, and inference latency. As developers and third parties customize these models, the need to provide efficient inference has increased. Many efforts have attempted to reduce inference cost through model compression techniques such as pruning and distillation. However, these techniques either require labeled data, or are time-consuming as they require the compressed model to be retrained to regain accuracy. In this paper, we propose a gradient-free structured pruning framework that uses only unlabeled data. An evaluation on the GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks using BERT_{BASE} and DistilBERT illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Prior work has focused on improving the accuracy of these models through prompt engineering or by incorporating a small amount of labeled downstream data (via finetuning). However, there has been little focus on improving the richness of the class names themselves, which can pose issues when class labels are coarsely-defined and are uninformative. We propose Classification with Hierarchical Label Sets (or CHiLS), an alternative strategy for zero-shot classification specifically designed for datasets with implicit semantic hierarchies. CHiLS proceeds in three steps: (i) for each class, produce a set of subclasses, using either existing label hierarchies or by querying GPT-3; (ii) perform the standard zero-shot CLIP procedure as though these subclasses were the labels of interest; (iii) map the predicted subclass back to its parent to produce the final prediction. Across numerous datasets with underlying hierarchical structure, CHiLS leads to improved accuracy in situations both with and without ground-truth hierarchical information. CHiLS is simple to implement within existing zero-shot pipelines and requires no additional training cost.},

In this paper we reveal additional fundamental advantages of stochastic methods over deterministic ones, which further motivate their use. First, we prove that any restoration algorithm that attains perfect perceptual quality and whose outputs are consistent with the input must be a posterior sampler, and is thus required to be stochastic. Second, we illustrate that while deterministic restoration algorithms may attain high perceptual quality, this can be achieved only by filling up the space of all possible source images using an extremely sensitive mapping, which makes them highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Indeed, we show that enforcing deterministic models to be robust to such attacks profoundly hinders their perceptual quality, while robustifying stochastic models hardly influences their perceptual quality, and improves their output variability. These findings provide a motivation to foster progress in stochastic restoration methods, paving the way to better recovery algorithms.},

In this context, it has been recently shown that if a classifier is calibrated, one can identify the smallest set of candidates which contains, in expectation, a desired number of qualified candidates using a threshold decision rule. This lends support to focusing on calibration as the only requirement for screening classifiers. In this paper, we argue that screening policies that use calibrated classifiers may suffer from an understudied type of within-group unfairness—they may unfairly treat qualified members within demographic groups of interest. Further, we argue that this type of unfairness can be avoided if classifiers satisfy within-group monotonicity, a natural monotonicity property within each group.},

While essential, this metric does not capture all aspects of robustness and in particular leaves out the question of how many perturbations can be found for each point. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach, adversarial sparsity, which quantifies how difficult it is to find a successful perturbation given both an input point and a constraint on the direction of the perturbation. We show that sparsity provides valuable insight into neural networks in multiple ways: for instance, it illustrates important differences between current state-of-the-art robust models that accuracy analysis does not, and suggests approaches for improving their robustness. When applying broken defenses effective against weak attacks but not strong ones, sparsity can discriminate between the totally ineffective and the partially effective defenses. Finally, with sparsity we can measure increases in robustness that do not affect accuracy: we show for example that data augmentation can by itself increase adversarial robustness, without using adversarial training.},

We propose a meta-learner called the B-Learner, which can efficiently learn sharp bounds on the CATE function under limits on the level of hidden confounding. The B-Learner can use any function estimator such as random forests and deep neural networks, and we prove its estimates are valid, sharp, efficient, and have a quasi-oracle property with respect to the constituent estimators under more general conditions than existing methods.

In this paper, we suggest that training Transformers on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to gradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a simple weight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations induced by 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on a regression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when training self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks either the models learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or, remarkably, the weights found by optimization match the construction. This allows us, at least in the domain of regression problems, to mechanistically understand the inner workings of in-context learning in optimized Transformers. Building on this insight, we furthermore identify how Transformers surpass the performance of plain gradient descent by learning an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models on deep data representations to solve non-linear regression tasks.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic data generation has become an emerging tool to help improve the adversarial robustness in classification tasks, since robust learning requires a significantly larger amount of training samples compared with standard classification. Among various deep generative models, the diffusion model has been shown to produce high-quality synthetic images and has achieved good performance in improving the adversarial robustness. However, diffusion-type methods are generally slower in data generation as compared with other generative models. Although different acceleration techniques have been proposed recently, it is also of great importance to study how to improve the sample efficiency of synthetic data for the downstream task. In this paper, we first analyze the optimality condition of synthetic distribution for achieving improved robust accuracy. We show that enhancing the distinguishability among the generated data is critical for improving adversarial robustness. Thus, we propose the Contrastive-Guided Diffusion Process (Contrastive-DP), which incorporates the contrastive loss to guide the diffusion model in data generation. We validate our theoretical results using simulations and demonstrate the good performance of Contrastive-DP on image datasets.},

  abstract     = {Prompt-tuning is an emerging strategy to adapt large language models (LLM) to downstream tasks by learning a (soft-)prompt parameter from data. Despite its success in LLMs, there is limited theoretical understanding of the power of prompt-tuning and the role of the attention mechanism in prompting. In this work, we explore prompt-tuning for one-layer attention architectures and study contextual mixture-models where each input token belongs to a context-relevant or -irrelevant set. We isolate the role of prompt-tuning through a self-contained prompt-attention model. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We show that softmax-prompt-attention is provably more expressive than softmax-self-attention and linear-prompt-attention under our contextual data model.},

  abstract     = {Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find an optimal policy for sequential decision-making using a pre-collected dataset, without further interaction with the environment. Recent theoretical progress has focused on developing sample-efficient offline RL algorithms with various relaxed assumptions on data coverage and function approximators, especially to handle the case with excessively large state-action spaces. Among them, the framework based on the linear-programming (LP) reformulation of Markov decision processes has shown promise: it enables sample-efficient offline RL with function approximation, under only partial data coverage and realizability assumptions on the function classes, with favorable computational tractability. In this work, we revisit the LP framework for offline RL, and provide a new reformulation that advances the existing results in several aspects, relaxing certain assumptions and achieving optimal statistical rates in terms of sample size. Our key enabler is to introduce proper constraints in the reformulation, instead of using any regularization as in the literature, also with careful choices of the function classes and initial state distributions. We hope our insights bring into light the use of LP formulations and the induced primal-dual minimax optimization, in offline RL.},

By definition, the target sequences and their attribute values are out of the training distribution, posing challenges to existing methods that aim to directly generate the target sequence. Instead, we propose Iterative Controlled Extrapolation (ICE) which iteratively makes local edits to a sequence to enable extrapolation. We train the model on synthetically generated sequence pairs that demonstrate small improvement in the attribute value. Results on one natural language task (sentiment analysis) and two protein engineering tasks (ACE2 stability and AAV fitness) show that ICE considerably outperforms state-of-the-art approaches despite its simplicity.},

Training a neural differential equation is effectively a search over a space of plausible dynamical systems.

Most prior works have used higher-order methods to reduce prediction timings while greatly increasing training time or reducing both training and prediction timings by relying on specific training algorithms, which are harder to use as a drop-in replacement. In this manuscript, we use internal cost heuristics of adaptive differential equation solvers at stochastic time-points to guide the training towards learning a dynamical system that is easier to integrate.},

But NCDEs do not scale well to longer sequences. Existing strategies adapt rough path theory, and instead model the dynamics over summaries known as log signatures. While rigorous and elegant, invertibility of these summaries is difficult, and limits the scope of problems where these ideas can offer strong benefits (reconstruction, generative modeling). For tasks where it is sensible to assume that the (long) sequences in the training data are a fixed length of temporal measurements -- this assumption holds in most experiments tackled in the literature -- we describe an efficient simplification. First, we recast the regression/classification task as an integral transform. We then show how restricting the class of operators (permissible in the integral transform), allows the use of a known algorithm that leverages non-standard Wavelets to decompose the operator. Thereby, our task (learning the operator) radically simplifies. A neural variant of this idea yields consistent improvements across a wide gamut of use cases tackled in existing works. We also describe a novel application on modeling tasks involving coupled differential equations.},

Hence, clustering on real-world graph with various levels of homophily poses a new challenge to the graph research community. To fill this gap, we propose a novel graph clustering method, which contains three key components: graph reconstruction, a mixed filter, and dual graph clustering network.

Towards answering these questions, we introduce {MACHIAVELLI}, a benchmark of 134 {Choose-Your-Own-Adventure} games containing over half a million rich, diverse scenarios that center on social decision-making. Scenario labeling is automated with {LMs}, which are more performant than human annotators. We mathematize dozens of harmful behaviors and use our annotations to evaluate agents' tendencies to be power-seeking, cause disutility, and commit ethical violations. We observe some tension between maximizing reward and behaving ethically. To improve this trade-off, we investigate {LM}-based methods to steer agents' towards less harmful behaviors. Our results show that agents can both act competently and morally, so concrete progress can currently be made in machine ethics---designing agents that are {Pareto} improvements in both safety and capabilities.},

They are trained to generate an object $x$ through a sequence of steps with probability proportional to some reward function $R(x)$ (or $\exp(-\mathcal{E}(x))$ with $\mathcal{E}(x)$ denoting the energy function), given at the end of the generative trajectory. Like for other {RL} settings where the reward is only given at the end, the efficiency of training and credit assignment may suffer when those trajectories are longer. With previous {GFlowNet} work, no learning was possible from incomplete trajectories (lacking a terminal state and the computation of the associated reward). In this paper, we consider the case where the energy function can be applied not just to terminal states but also to intermediate states. This is for example achieved when the energy function is additive, with terms available along the trajectory. We show how to reparameterize the {GFlowNet} state flow function to take advantage of the partial reward already accrued at each state. This enables a training objective that can be applied to update parameters even with incomplete trajectories. Even when complete trajectories are available, being able to obtain more localized credit and gradients is found to speed up training convergence, as demonstrated across many simulations.},

The fundamental insight is that a concept drift can be detected based on the magnitude of parameter updates that are required to fit the global model to each participating client's local data distribution. Flash uses a two-pronged approach that synergizes client-side early-stopping training to facilitate detection of concept drifts and the server-side drift-aware adaptive optimization to effectively adjust effective learning rate. The authors theoretically prove that Flash matches the convergence rate of state-of-the-art adaptive optimizers and further empirically evaluate the efficacy of Flash on a variety of {FL} benchmarks using different concept drift settings.},

This paper introduces the term skill localization for this problem and proposes a solution. Given the downstream task and a model fine-tuned on that task, a simple optimization is used to identify a very small subset of parameters (~0.01\% of model parameters) responsible for (>95\%) of the model's performance, in the sense that grafting the fine-tuned values for just this tiny subset onto the pre-trained model gives performance almost as well as the fine-tuned model. While reminiscent of recent works on parameter-efficient fine-tuning, the novel aspects here are that: (i) No further re-training is needed on the subset (unlike, say, with lottery tickets). (ii) Notable improvements are seen over vanilla fine-tuning with respect to calibration of predictions in-distribution (40-90\% error reduction) as well as the quality of predictions out-of-distribution ({OOD}).},

In this work, we demonstrate that the properties of hyperbolic geometry serve as a valuable alternative to learning hierarchical affinity for spatial propagation tasks. We propose a Hyperbolic Affinity learning Module ({HAM}) to learn spatial affinity by considering geodesic distance on the hyperbolic space. By simply incorporating our {HAM} into conventional spatial propagation tasks, we validate its effectiveness, capturing the pixel hierarchy of affinity maps in hyperbolic space. The proposed methodology can lead to performance improvements in explicit propagation processes such as depth completion and semantic segmentation.},

  abstract     = {The goal of data attribution is to trace model predictions back to training data. Despite a long line of work towards this goal, existing approaches to data attribution tend to force users to choose between computational tractability and efficacy. That is, computationally tractable methods can struggle with accurately attributing model predictions in non-convex settings (e.g., in the context of deep neural networks), while methods that are effective in such regimes require training thousands of models, which makes them impractical for large models or datasets. In this work, we introduce {TRAK} (Tracing with the Randomly-projected After Kernel), a data attribution method that is both effective and computationally tractable for large-scale, differentiable models. In particular, by leveraging only a handful of trained models, {TRAK} can match the performance of attribution methods that require training thousands of models. We demonstrate the utility of {TRAK} across various modalities and scales: image classifiers trained on {ImageNet}, vision-language models ({CLIP}), and language models ({BERT} and m{T}5).},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning ({FL}) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm for data privacy preservation. Recently, a knowledge distillation ({KD}) based information sharing approach in {FL}, which conducts ensemble distillation on an unlabeled public dataset, has been proposed. However, despite its experimental success and usefulness, the theoretical analysis of the {KD} based approach has not been satisfactorily conducted. In this work, we build a theoretical foundation of the ensemble distillation framework in federated learning from the perspective of kernel ridge regression ({KRR}). In this end, we propose a {KD} based {FL} algorithm for {KRR} models which is related with some existing {KD} based {FL} algorithms, and analyze our algorithm theoretically. We show that our algorithm makes local prediction models as much powerful as the centralized {KRR} model (which is a {KRR} model trained by all of local datasets) in terms of the convergence rate of the generalization error if the unlabeled public dataset is sufficiently large. We also provide experimental results to verify our theoretical results on ensemble distillation in federated learning.},

  abstract     = {In domain generalization ({DG}), the target domain is unknown when the model is being trained, and the trained model should successfully work on an arbitrary (and possibly unseen) target domain during inference. This is a difficult problem, and despite active studies in recent years, it remains a great challenge. In this paper, we take a simple yet effective approach to tackle this issue. We propose test-time style shifting, which shifts the style of the test sample (that has a large style gap with the source domains) to the nearest source domain that the model is already familiar with, before making the prediction. This strategy enables the model to handle any target domains with arbitrary style statistics, without additional model update at test-time. Additionally, we propose style balancing, which provides a great platform for maximizing the advantage of test-time style shifting by handling the {DG}-specific imbalance issues. The proposed ideas are easy to implement and successfully work in conjunction with various other {DG} schemes. Experimental results on different datasets show the effectiveness of our methods.},

On the other hand, super-resolution on real-world images demands the capability to handle complex downscaling mechanism which produces different artifacts (e.g., noise, blur, color distortion) upon downscaling factors. To account for complex downscaling mechanism in real-world {LR} images, there have been a few efforts in constructing datasets consisting of {LR} images with real-world downsampling degradation. However, making such datasets entails a tremendous amount of time and effort, thereby resorting to very few number of downscaling factors (e.g., $\times2, \times3, \times4$). To remedy the issue, we propose to generate realistic {SR} datasets for unseen degradation levels by exploring the latent space of real {LR} images and thereby producing more diverse yet realistic {LR} images with complex real-world artifacts. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the generated {LR} images, and we show that the various conventional {SR} networks trained with our newly generated {SR} datasets can produce much better {HR} images.},

Errors in this predictive model can degrade the performance of model-based controllers, and complex {M}arkov decision processes ({MDP}s) can present exceptionally difficult prediction problems. To mitigate this issue, we propose predictable {MDP} abstraction ({PMA}): instead of training a predictive model on the original {MDP}, we train a model on a transformed {MDP} with a learned action space that only permits predictable, easy-to-model actions, while covering the original state-action space as much as possible. As a result, model learning becomes easier and more accurate, which allows robust, stable model-based planning or model-based {RL}. This transformation is learned in an unsupervised manner, before any task is specified by the user. Downstream tasks can then be solved with model-based control in a zero-shot fashion, without additional environment interactions. We theoretically analyze {PMA} and empirically demonstrate that {PMA} leads to significant improvements over prior unsupervised model-based {RL} approaches in a range of benchmark environments.},

However, the current unsupervised skill discovery methods are often limited to acquiring simple, easy-to-learn skills due to the lack of incentives to discover more complex, challenging behaviors. We introduce a novel unsupervised skill discovery method, Controllability-aware Skill Discovery ({CSD}), which actively seeks complex, hard-to-control skills without supervision. The key component of {CSD} is a controllability-aware distance function, which assigns larger values to state transitions that are harder to achieve with the current skills. Combined with distance-maximizing skill discovery, {CSD} progressively learns more challenging skills over the course of training as our jointly trained distance function reduces rewards for easy-to-achieve skills. Our experimental results in six robotic manipulation and locomotion environments demonstrate that {CSD} can discover diverse complex skills including object manipulation and locomotion skills with no supervision, significantly outperforming prior unsupervised skill discovery methods.},

In this work, we characterize the optimal accelerated rate of infeasibility detection. We show that the standard fixed-point iteration achieves a $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ rates, respectively, on the normalized iterates and the fixed-point residual converging to the infimal displacement vector, while the accelerated fixed-point iteration achieves $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/k^2)$ rates. We then provide a matching complexity lower bound to establish that $\Theta(1/k^2)$ is indeed the optimal accelerated rate.},

However, {IVW}-based composite estimators have not yet been applied in modern {RL} tasks, as it is unclear if they can be implemented scalably. We propose a scalable method, Total Propagation X ({TPX}) that improves over {TP} by changing the node used for {IVW}, and employing coordinate wise weighting. We demonstrate the scalability of {TPX} by applying it to the state of the art visual {MBRL} algorithm Dreamer.

These are representations of the covariates such that the best model on top of the representation is invariant across training environments. In the context of linear Structural Equation Models ({SEM}s), invariant representations might allow us to learn models with out-of-distribution guarantees, i.e., models that are robust to interventions in the {SEM}. To address the invariant representation problem in a finite sample setting, we consider the notion of $\epsilon$-approximate invariance. We study the following question: If a representation is approximately invariant with respect to a given number of training interventions, will it continue to be approximately invariant on a larger collection of unseen {SEM}s? This larger collection of {SEM}s is generated through a parameterized family of interventions. Inspired by {PAC} learning, we obtain finite-sample out-of-distribution generalization guarantees for approximate invariance that holds probabilistically over a family of linear {SEM}s without faithfulness assumptions. Our results show bounds that do not scale in ambient dimension when intervention sites are restricted to lie in a constant size subset of in-degree bounded nodes. We also show how to extend our results to a linear indirect observation model that incorporates latent variables.},

Despite being observed in the brain and in artificial networks, the mechanisms of drift and its implications are not fully understood. Motivated by recent experimental findings of stimulus-dependent drift in the piriform cortex, we use theory and simulations to study this phenomenon in a two-layer linear feedforward network. Specifically, in a continual online learning scenario, we study the drift induced by the noise inherent in the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). By decomposing the learning dynamics into the normal and tangent spaces of the minimum-loss manifold, we show the former corresponds to a finite variance fluctuation, while the latter could be considered as an effective diffusion process on the manifold. We analytically compute the fluctuation and the diffusion coefficients for the stimuli representations in the hidden layer as functions of network parameters and input distribution. Further, consistent with experiments, we show that the drift rate is slower for a more frequently presented stimulus. Overall, our analysis yields a theoretical framework for better understanding of the drift phenomenon in biological and artificial neural networks.},

Unfortunately equivariant convolutions, which are a fundamental operation for equivariant networks, increase significantly in computational complexity as higher-order tensors are used. In this paper, we address this issue by reducing the SO(3) convolutions or tensor products to mathematically equivalent convolutions in SO(2). This is accomplished by aligning the node embeddings' primary axis with the edge vectors, which sparsifies the tensor product and reduces the computational complexity from O(L^6) to O(L^3), where L is the degree of the representation. We demonstrate the potential implications of this improvement by proposing the Equivariant Spherical Channel Network (eSCN), a graph neural network utilizing our novel approach to equivariant convolutions, which achieves state-of-the-art results on the large-scale OC-20 and OC-22 datasets.},

We aim to minimize the average regret on M machines working in parallel over T rounds with R intermittent communications. Assuming the underlying cost functions are convex and can be generated adaptively, our results show that collaboration is not beneficial when the machines have access to the first-order gradient information at the queried points. This is in contrast to the case for stochastic functions, where each machine samples the cost functions from a fixed distribution. Furthermore, we delve into the more challenging setting of federated online optimization with bandit (zeroth-order) feedback, where the machines can only access values of the cost functions at the queried points. The key finding here is identifying the high-dimensional regime where collaboration is beneficial and may even lead to a linear speedup in the number of machines. We further illustrate our findings through federated adversarial linear bandits by developing novel distributed single and two-point feedback algorithms. Our work is the first attempt towards a systematic understanding of federated online optimization with limited feedback, and it attains tight regret bounds in the intermittent communication setting for both first and zeroth-order feedback. Our results thus bridge the gap between stochastic and adaptive settings in federated online optimization.},

Existing tools for identifying program invariants rely on dynamic analysis, requiring traces collected from multiple executions in order to produce reliable invariants. We study the application of large language models to invariant prediction, finding that models trained on source code and fine-tuned for invariant generation can perform invariant prediction as static rather than dynamic analysis. Using a scratchpad approach where invariants are predicted sequentially through a program gives the best performance, finding invariants statically of quality comparable to those obtained by a dynamic analysis tool with access to five program traces.},

Our method converts weight-based neural structure to its dynamics-based form that consists of finite sub-models, whose mutual relations measured by computing path integrals amongst their dynamical states are equivalent to the typical neural weights. Based on the entropy reduction process derived from the Euler-Lagrange equations, the feedback signals interpreted as stress forces amongst sub-models push them to move based on the entropy-reduction process. The method first trains dynamics-based neural models from scratch and shows they outperform traditional feedforward networks on MNIST. Then it converts several pre-trained neural structures (e.g., DenseNet, ResNet, Transformers, etc.) into dynamics-based forms, followed by fine-tuning via entropy-reduction to obtain the stabilized dynamic states. We observe consistent improvements of these transformed models on the ImageNet dataset in terms of computational complexity, the number of trainable units, testing accuracy, and robustness.},

Most of them first generate atoms and then add chemical bonds based on the generated atoms in a post-processing manner. However, there might be no corresponding bond solution for the temporally generated atoms as their locations are generated without considering potential bonds. We define this problem as the atom-bond inconsistency problem and claim it is the main reason for current approaches to generating unrealistic 3D molecules. To overcome this problem, we propose a new diffusion model called MolDiff which can generate atoms and bonds simultaneously while still maintaining their consistency by explicitly modeling the dependence between their relationships. We evaluated the generation ability of our proposed model and the quality of the generated molecules using criteria related to both geometry and chemical properties. The empirical studies showed that our model outperforms previous approaches, achieving a three-fold improvement in success rate and generating molecules with significantly better quality.},

A key challenge in this setting is that the learner may "forget" how to solve a previous task when learning a new task, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, many practical methods have been proposed, including memory-based, regularization-based and expansion-based methods. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of these methods remains elusive. This paper aims to bridge this gap between theory and practice by proposing a new continual learning framework called "Ideal Continual Learner" (ICL), which is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic forgetting by construction. We show that ICL unifies multiple well-established continual learning methods and gives new theoretical insights into the strengths and weaknesses of these methods.},

Data augmentation can help models be more robust to such shifts by varying specific concepts in the state, e.g. object color, that are "task-irrelevant" and should not impact desired actions. However, designers training the agent don't often know which concepts are irrelevant "a priori". The authors propose a human-in-the-loop framework to leverage feedback from the end user to quickly identify and augment task-irrelevant visual state concepts. Their framework generates "counterfactual demonstrations" that allow users to quickly isolate shifted state concepts and identify if they should not impact the desired task, and can therefore be augmented using existing actions. They present experiments validating their full pipeline on discrete and continuous control tasks with real human users. Their method better enables users to (1) understand agent failure, (2) improve sample efficiency of demonstrations required for finetuning, and (3) adapt the agent to their desired reward.},

  abstract     = {The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is one of the most widely used statistical models for sequential data analysis. One of the key reasons for this versatility is the ability of HMM to deal with missing data. However, standard HMM learning algorithms rely crucially on the assumption that the positions of the missing observations within the observation sequence are known. In the natural sciences, where this assumption is often violated, special variants of HMM, commonly known as Silent-state HMMs (SHMMs), are used. Despite their widespread use, these algorithms strongly rely on specific structural assumptions of the underlying chain, such as acyclicity, thus limiting the applicability of these methods. Moreover, even in the acyclic case, it has been shown that these methods can lead to poor reconstruction. In this paper we consider the general problem of learning an HMM from data with unknown missing observation locations. We provide reconstruction algorithms that do not require any assumptions about the structure of the underlying chain, and can also be used with limited prior knowledge, unlike SHMM. We evaluate and compare the algorithms in a variety of scenarios, measuring their reconstruction precision, and robustness under model miss-specification. Notably, we show that under proper specifications one can reconstruct the process dynamics as well as if the missing observations positions were known.},

These scores need to be transformed into actual predictions by thresholding, so that the proportion of examples marked as anomalies equals the expected proportion of anomalies, called contamination factor. Unfortunately, there are no good methods for estimating the contamination factor itself. We address this need from a Bayesian perspective, introducing a method for estimating the posterior distribution of the contamination factor of a given unlabeled dataset. We leverage on outputs of several anomaly detectors as a representation that already captures the basic notion of anomalousness and estimate the contamination using a specific mixture formulation. Empirically on 22 datasets, we show that the estimated distribution is well-calibrated and that setting the threshold using the posterior mean improves the anomaly detectors' performance over several alternative methods.

Our first result is a sharp asymptotic expression for the test and training errors in the high-dimensional regime. Motivated by the recent stream of results on the Gaussian universality of the test and training errors in generalized linear estimation, we ask ourselves the question: 'when is a single Gaussian enough to characterize the error?'. Our formula allow us to give sharp answers to this question, both in the positive and negative directions. More precisely, we show that the sufficient conditions for Gaussian universality (or lack of thereof) crucially depend on the alignment between the target weights and the means and covariances of the mixture clusters, which we precisely quantify. In the particular case of least-squares interpolation, we prove a strong universality property of the training error, and show it follows a simple, closed-form expression. Finally, we apply our results to real datasets, clarifying some recent discussion in the literature about Gaussian universality of the errors in this context.},

In this paper, we propose Attention-based Embeddings of Recurrence In multi-Agent Learning (AERIAL) to approximate value functions under stochastic partial observability. AERIAL replaces the true state with a learned representation of multi-agent recurrence, considering more accurate information about decentralized agent decisions than state-based CTDE. We then introduce MessySMAC, a modified version of SMAC with stochastic observations and higher variance in initial states, to provide a more general and configurable benchmark regarding stochastic partial observability. We evaluate AERIAL in Dec-Tiger as well as in a variety of SMAC and MessySMAC maps, and compare the results with state-based CTDE. Furthermore, we evaluate the robustness of AERIAL and state-based CTDE against various stochasticity configurations in MessySMAC.},

In natural language processing, this is often addressed using reinforcement learning techniques that align models with a task reward. We adopt this approach and show its surprising effectiveness to improve generic models pretrained to imitate example outputs across multiple computer vision tasks, such as object detection, panoptic segmentation, colorization and image captioning. We believe this approach has the potential to be widely useful for better aligning models with a diverse range of computer vision tasks.},

Among UQ methods, conformal prediction (CP) approaches provides distribution-free guarantees under minimal assumptions. We develop a new federated conformal prediction method based on quantile regression and take into account privacy constraints.

This small data regime in machine learning can be made tractable by providing our algorithms with prior information about the underlying dynamics. Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been very successful in this regime (reconstructing entire ODE solutions using only a single point or entire PDE solutions with very few measurements of the initial condition). The Universal PINN approach (UPINN) adds a neural network that learns a representation of unknown hidden terms in the differential equation. The algorithm yields both a surrogate solution to the differential equation and a black-box representation of the hidden terms. These hidden term neural networks can then be converted into symbolic equations using symbolic regression techniques like AI Feynman. In order to achieve convergence of the neural networks, we provide our algorithms with (noisy) measurements of both the initial condition as well as (synthetic) experimental data obtained at later times. We demonstrate strong performance of UPINNs even when provided with very few measurements of noisy data in both the ODE and PDE regime.},

However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers at scale, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In challenging reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-space models, transfer functions, and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets WikiText103 and The Pile, reaching Transformer quality with a 20\% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2k. Hyena operators are 2x faster than highly optimized attention at sequence length 8k, with speedups of 100x at 64k.},

We propose Multisample Flow Matching, a more general framework that uses non-trivial couplings between data and noise samples while satisfying the correct marginal constraints.

All existing statistical analyses of this problem require the assumption that the transport map is Lipschitz, a strong requirement that, in particular, excludes any examples where the transport map is discontinuous. As a first step towards developing estimation procedures for discontinuous maps, we consider the important special case where the data distribution $Q$ is a discrete measure supported on a finite number of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We study a computationally efficient estimator initially proposed by (Pooladian \& Niles-Weed, 2021), based on entropic optimal transport, and show in the semi-discrete setting that it converges at the minimax-optimal rate $n^{-1/2}$, independent of dimension. Other standard map estimation techniques both lack finite-sample guarantees in this setting and provably suffer from the curse of dimensionality. We confirm these results in numerical experiments, and provide experiments for other settings, not covered by our theory, which indicate that the entropic estimator is a promising methodology for other discontinuous transport map estimation problems.},

  abstract     = {Graph Neural Networks ({GNN}) are inherently limited in their expressive power. Recent seminal works introduced the Weisfeiler-Lehman ({WL}) hierarchy as a measure of expressive power. Although this hierarchy has propelled significant advances in {GNN} analysis and architecture developments, it suffers from several significant limitations. These include a complex definition that lacks direct guidance for model improvement and a {WL} hierarchy that is too coarse to study current {GNN}s. This paper introduces an alternative expressive power hierarchy based on the ability of {GNN}s to calculate equivariant polynomials of a certain degree. As a first step, we provide a full characterization of all equivariant graph polynomials by introducing a concrete basis, significantly generalizing previous results. Each basis element corresponds to a specific multi-graph, and its computation over some graph data input corresponds to a tensor contraction problem. Second, we propose algorithmic tools for evaluating the expressiveness of {GNN}s using tensor contraction sequences, and calculate the expressive power of popular {GNN}s. Finally, we enhance the expressivity of common {GNN} architectures by adding polynomial features or additional operations / aggregations inspired by our theory. These enhanced {GNN}s demonstrate state-of-the-art results in experiments across multiple graph learning benchmarks.},

This motivates us to learn {3D} representations by sharing the merits of both paradigms, which is non-trivial due to the pattern difference between the two paradigms. In this paper, we propose Contrast with Reconstruct ({ReCon}) that unifies these two paradigms. {ReCon} is trained to learn from both generative modeling teachers and single/cross-modal contrastive teachers through ensemble distillation, where the generative student guides the contrastive student. An encoder-decoder style {ReCon}-block is proposed that transfers knowledge through cross attention with stop-gradient, which avoids pretraining over-fitting and pattern difference issues.},

Despite the considerable progress we have achieved, existing methods usually generate molecules in atom resolution and ignore intrinsic local structures such as rings, which leads to poor quality in generated structures, especially when generating large molecules. Fragment-based molecule generation is a promising strategy, however, it is nontrivial to be adapted for {3D} non-autoregressive generations because of the combinational optimization problems. In this paper, we utilize a coarse-to-fine strategy to tackle this problem, in which a Hierarchical Diffusion-based model (i.e., {HierDiff}) is proposed to preserve the validity of local segments without relying on autoregressive modeling. Specifically, {HierDiff} first generates coarse-grained molecule geometries via an equivariant diffusion process, where each coarse-grained node reflects a fragment in a molecule. Then, the coarse-grained nodes are decoded into fine-grained fragments by a message-passing process and a newly designed iterative refined sampling module. Finally, the fine-grained fragments are assembled to derive a complete atomic molecular structure.},

However, this assumption is impractical as no one could guarantee the existence of the correct label in the candidate label set under real-world scenarios. Therefore, Unreliable Partial Label Learning ({UPLL}) is investigated where the correct label of each example may not exist in the candidate label set. In this paper, we propose a fusion framework of refinement and disambiguation named {FREDIS} to handle the {UPLL} problem. Specifically, with theoretical guarantees, not only does disambiguation move incorrect labels from candidate labels to non-candidate labels but also refinement, an opposite procedure, moves correct labels from non-candidate labels to candidate labels. Besides, we prove that the classifier trained by our framework could eventually approximate the Bayes optimal classifier.},

These nuggets are learned through tasks like autoencoding and machine translation, and intuitively segment language into meaningful units. Nugget dynamically chooses which tokens are aggregated into the encoded representation, representing a departure from traditional fixed-size embeddings and providing a more adaptive approach to text representation.},

  abstract     = {Network binarization emerges as one of the most promising compression approaches offering extraordinary computation and memory savings by minimizing the bit-width. However, recent research has shown that applying existing binarization algorithms to diverse tasks, architectures, and hardware in realistic scenarios is still not straightforward. Common challenges of binarization, such as accuracy degradation and efficiency limitation, suggest that its attributes are not fully understood. To close this gap, we present {BiBench}, a rigorously designed benchmark with in-depth analysis for network binarization. We first carefully scrutinize the requirements of binarization in the actual production and define evaluation tracks and metrics for a comprehensive and fair investigation. Then, we evaluate and analyze a series of milestone binarization algorithms that function at the operator level and with extensive influence. Our benchmark reveals that 1) the binarized operator has a crucial impact on the performance and deployability of binarized networks; 2) the accuracy of binarization varies significantly across different learning tasks and neural architectures; 3) binarization has demonstrated promising efficiency potential on edge devices despite the limited hardware support.},

The common practice of using a global temperature parameter ignores the fact that ``not all semantics are created equal'', meaning that different anchor data may have different numbers of samples with similar semantics, especially when data exhibits long-tails. First, we propose a new robust contrastive loss inspired by distributionally robust optimization ({DRO}), providing us an intuition about the effect of temperature and a mechanism for automatic temperature individualization. Then, we propose an efficient stochastic algorithm for optimizing the robust contrastive loss with a provable convergence guarantee without using large mini-batch sizes. Theoretical and experimental results show that our algorithm automatically learns a suitable temperature for each sample. Specifically, samples with frequent semantics use large temperatures to keep local semantic structures, while samples with rare semantics use small temperatures to induce more separable features.},

It performs well in practice even though it is not theoretically well understood. In particular, whereas traditional population-based search methods such as evolutionary algorithms ({EA}s) draw much power from crossover operations, it is difficult to take advantage of them in {NAS}. The main obstacle is believed to be the permutation problem: The mapping between genotype and phenotype in traditional graph representations is many-to-one, leading to a disruptive effect of standard crossover. This paper presents the first theoretical analysis of the behaviors of mutation, crossover and {RL} in black-box {NAS}, and proposes a new crossover operator based on the shortest edit path ({SEP}) in graph space. The {SEP} crossover is shown theoretically to overcome the permutation problem, and as a result, have a better expected improvement compared to mutation.},

Standard methods for reducing the reliance on spurious features typically assume that we know what the spurious feature is, which is rarely true in the real world. Methods that attempt to alleviate this limitation are complex, hard to tune, and lead to a significant computational overhead compared to standard training. In this paper, we propose Automatic Feature Reweighting (AFR), an extremely simple and fast method for updating the model to reduce the reliance on spurious features. AFR retrains the last layer of a standard ERM-trained base model with a weighted loss that emphasizes the examples where the ERM model predicts poorly, automatically upweighting the minority group without group labels. With this simple procedure, we improve upon the best reported results among competing methods trained without spurious attributes on several vision and natural language classification benchmarks, using only a fraction of their compute.},

We propose Sequential Multi-Dimensional SSL, where an SSL loss is applied both at the level of the entire sequence and at the level of the individual high-dimensional data points in the sequence to better capture information at both scales. Our method is agnostic to the specific form of loss function used at each level. We evaluate our approach on two real-world clinical datasets where the time series contains sequences of high-frequency electrocardiograms and structured data from lab values and vitals signs. Our experimental results indicate that pre-training with our method and then fine-tuning on downstream tasks improves performance over baselines on both datasets.},

Experimental evidence suggests a strong interplay between the heaviness of the tails and generalization behavior of SGD. Very recently, new generalization bounds have been proven, indicating a non-monotonic relationship between the generalization error and heavy tails. While these bounds do not require additional topological assumptions, they can only apply to simple quadratic problems. In this paper, we build on this line of research and develop generalization bounds for a more general class of objective functions, which includes non-convex functions as well. Our approach is based on developing Wasserstein stability bounds for heavy-tailed SDEs and their discretizations, which we then convert to generalization bounds. Our results do not require any nontrivial assumptions; yet, they shed more light on the empirical observations thanks to the generality of the loss functions.},

Yet, as we show in this paper, whether current methods succeed at this goal is unclear, due to the limited coverage of the evaluation. We study the URLB and propose a new method to solve it, using unsupervised model-based RL, for pre-training the agent, and a task-aware fine-tuning strategy combined with a new proposed hybrid planner, Dyna-MPC, to adapt the agent for downstream tasks. On URLB, our method obtains 93.59\% overall normalized performance, surpassing previous baselines by a staggering margin. We also show robust performance on the Real-World RL benchmark, hinting at resiliency to environment perturbations during adaptation.},

We propose SpotEM, an approach to achieve efficiency for a given EM method while maintaining good accuracy. SpotEM is a clip-selection approach that spots clips relevant to the query cheaply and selectively processes these clips to serve as inputs to the EM model. SpotEM consists of three key ideas: 1) a novel clip selector that learns to identify promising video regions to search conditioned on the language query; 2) a set of low-cost semantic indexing features that capture the context of rooms, objects, and interactions that suggest where to look; and 3) distillation losses that address the optimization issues arising from end-to-end joint training of the clip selector and EM model. Experiments on 200+ hours of video from the Ego4D EM Natural Language Queries benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: computing only 10\%--25\% of the clip features, SpotEM preserves 84\%--97\% of the original EM model's accuracy.},

A growing body of recent literature shows that the bias of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and architecture choice implicitly leads to better generalization. In this paper, we show on the contrary that, independently of architecture, SGD can itself be the cause of poor generalization if one does not ensure good initialization. We prove a theoretical result called the "weak spectral bias law": any differentiably parameterized model, trained under gradient flow, obeys a weak spectral bias law which states that sufficiently high frequencies train arbitrarily slowly, which implies that very high frequencies present at initialization will remain after training, and hamper generalization. Through a Fourier lens, we derive a general result for the spectral bias of neural networks and show that the generalization of neural networks is heavily tied to their initialization. Finally, we contrast our framework with that supplied by the flat-minima conjecture and show that Fourier analysis grants a more reliable framework for understanding the generalization of neural networks.},

  abstract     = {Foundation models are redefining how AI systems are built. Practitioners now follow a standard procedure to build their machine learning solutions: from a pre-trained foundation model, they fine-tune the weights on the target task of interest. So, the Internet is swarmed by a handful of foundation models fine-tuned on many diverse tasks: these individual fine-tunings exist in isolation without benefiting from each other. In our opinion, this is a missed opportunity, as these specialized models contain rich and diverse features. In this paper, we thus propose model ratatouille, a new strategy to recycle the multiple fine-tunings of the same foundation model on diverse auxiliary tasks. Specifically, we repurpose these auxiliary weights as initializations for multiple parallel fine-tunings on the target task; then, we average all fine-tuned weights to obtain the final model. This recycling strategy aims at maximizing the diversity in weights by leveraging the diversity in auxiliary tasks. Empirically, it improves the state of the art on the reference DomainBed benchmark for out-of-distribution generalization. Looking forward, this work contributes to the emerging paradigm of updatable machine learning where, akin to open-source software development, the community collaborates to reliably update machine learning models.},

  abstract     = {Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is a promising technology to protect clients' data privacy for Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) on public clouds. However, HE operations can be orders of magnitude slower than their counterparts for plaintexts and thus result in prohibitively high inference latency, seriously hindering the practicality of HE. In this paper, we propose a HE-based fast neural network (NN) inference framework--SpENCNN built upon the co-design of HE operation-aware model sparsity and the single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD)-friendly data packing, to improve NN inference latency. In particular, we first develop an encryption-aware HE-group convolution technique that can partition channels among different groups based on the data size and ciphertext size, and then encode them into the same ciphertext by novel group-interleaved encoding, so as to dramatically reduce the number of costly HE operations. Moreover, we propose a HE-friendly sub-block weight pruning to reduce costly HE-based convolution operations while maintaining good model accuracy. Experimental results show that SpENCNN can achieve overall speedups of 8.37×, 12.11×, 19.26×, and 1.87× for LeNet, VGG-5, HEFNet, and ResNet-20 respectively, with negligible accuracy loss.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of learning the best possible policy from a fixed dataset, known as offline Reinforcement Learning (RL). A common taxonomy of existing offline RL works is policy regularization, which typically constrains the learned policy by distribution or support of the behavior policy. However, distribution and support constraints are overly conservative since they both force the policy to choose similar actions as the behavior policy when considering particular states. It will limit the learned policy's performance, especially when the behavior policy is sub-optimal. In this paper, we find that regularizing the policy towards the nearest state-action pair can be more effective and thus propose Policy Regularization with Dataset Constraint (PRDC). When updating the policy in a given state, PRDC searches the entire dataset for the nearest state-action sample and then restricts the policy with the action of this sample. Unlike previous works, PRDC can guide the policy with proper behaviors from the dataset, allowing it to choose actions that do not appear in the dataset along with the given state. It is a softer constraint but still keeps enough conservatism from out-of-distribution actions. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis show that PRDC can alleviate offline RL's fundamentally challenging value overestimation issue with a bounded performance gap. Moreover, on a set of locomotion and navigation tasks, PRDC achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing methods.},

Recent research has identified a training phenomenon called Neural Collapse (NC), in which the top-layer feature embeddings of samples from the same class tend to concentrate around their means, and the top layer's weights align with those features. Our study aims to investigate if these properties extend to intermediate layers. We empirically study the evolution of the covariance and mean of representations across different layers and show that as we move deeper into a trained neural network, the within-class covariance decreases relative to the between-class covariance. Additionally, we find that in the top layers, where the between-class covariance is dominant, the subspace spanned by the class means aligns with the subspace spanned by the most significant singular vector components of the weight matrix in the corresponding layer.},

  abstract     = {Discount regularization, using a shorter planning horizon when calculating the optimal policy, is a popular choice to restrict planning to a less complex set of policies when estimating an MDP from sparse or noisy data. It is commonly understood that discount regularization functions by de-emphasizing or ignoring delayed effects. In this paper, we reveal an alternate view of discount regularization that exposes unintended consequences. We demonstrate that planning under a lower discount factor produces an identical optimal policy to planning using any prior on the transition matrix that has the same distribution for all states and actions. This prior view explains the success of discount regularization in many settings, but also exposes problematic assumptions implicit in discount regularization. In particular, this view reveals that discount regularization imposes a stronger penalty on state-action pairs with more transition data, causing systematic bias toward the prior and poor performance when the data is uneven across state-action pairs. Based on our analysis, we propose an improved regularization method and demonstrate its performance across a range of synthetic and real domains.},

However, the discovery of such formulas has historically remained scarce, often perceived as an act of mathematical genius by great mathematicians such as Ramanujan, Euler, and Gauss. Recent efforts to automate the discovery of formulas for mathematical constants, such as the Ramanujan Machine project, relied on exhaustive search. Despite several successful discoveries, exhaustive search remains limited by the space of options that can be covered and by the need for vast amounts of computational resources. In this paper, we present a fundamentally different approach for finding conjectures on mathematical constants. Instead of searching for continued fractions, we search for patterns in integer sequences. This approach is motivated by the fact that many mathematical constants can be represented as the limits of infinite series whose partial sums are integer sequences. We then use machine learning to identify these integer sequences and to automatically find the underlying mathematical structures.},

We show that, by leveraging the fast learning nature of few-shot learners, one can train language models efficiently in a stagewise manner. Our main insight is that stacking a good few-shot learner on a good small language model provides a good initializer for a larger language model. Using this insight and building upon progressive stacking approaches, we develop novel approaches for training such networks in a stagewise manner. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of both computational efficiency and performance.},

  abstract     = {The uncanny ability of over-parameterised neural networks to generalise well has been explained using various "simplicity biases". These theories postulate that neural networks avoid overfitting by first fitting simple, linear classifiers before learning more complex, non-linear functions. Meanwhile, data structure is also recognised as a key ingredient for good generalisation, yet its role in simplicity biases is not yet understood. Here, we show that neural networks trained using stochastic gradient descent initially classify their inputs using lower-order input statistics, like mean and covariance, and exploit higher-order statistics only later during training. We first demonstrate this distributional simplicity bias (DSB) in a solvable model of a single neuron trained on synthetic data. We then demonstrate DSB empirically in a range of deep convolutional networks and visual transformers trained on CIFAR10, and show that it even holds in networks pre-trained on ImageNet. We discuss the relation of DSB to other simplicity biases and consider its implications for the principle of universality in learning.},

Based on this, our study proves that compared to standard deep neural networks (DNNs), it is less likely for BNNs to encode complex concepts. Experiments verify our theoretical proofs.

While existing works have shown that zeroth-order methods utilizing Ω(d) function valuations per iteration (with d denoting the problem dimension) can escape saddle points efficiently, it remains an open question if zeroth-order methods based on two-point estimators can escape saddle points. In this paper, we show that by adding an appropriate isotropic perturbation at each iteration, a zeroth-order algorithm based on 2m (for any 1 ≤ m ≤ d) function evaluations per iteration can not only find ε-second order stationary points polynomially fast, but do so using only Õ(d/mε²ψ̄) function evaluations, where ψ̄ ≥ Ω̃(√ε) is a parameter capturing the extent to which the function of interest exhibits the strict saddle property.},

We start with the observation that those methods crucially rely on the presence of a predictor network (and stop-gradient). With simple linear algebra, we show that when using a linear predictor, the optimal predictor is close to an orthogonal projection, and propose a general framework based on orthonormalization that enables to interpret and give intuition on why BYOL works. In addition, this framework demonstrates the crucial role of the exponential moving average and stop-gradient operator in BYOL as an efficient orthonormalization mechanism. We use these insights to propose four new closed-form predictor variants of BYOL to support our analysis. Our closed-form predictors outperform standard linear trainable predictor BYOL at 100 and 300 epochs (top-1 linear accuracy on ImageNet).},

  abstract     = {$k$-nearest neighbor classification is a popular non-parametric method because of desirable properties like automatic adaption to distributional scale changes. Unfortunately, it has thus far proved difficult to design active learning strategies for the training of local voting-based classifiers that naturally retain these desirable properties, and hence active learning strategies for $k$-nearest neighbor classification have been conspicuously missing from the literature. In this work, we introduce a simple and intuitive active learning algorithm for the training of $k$-nearest neighbor classifiers, the first in the literature which retains the concept of the $k$-nearest neighbor vote at prediction time. We provide consistency guarantees for a modified $k$-nearest neighbors classifier trained on samples acquired via our scheme, and show that when the conditional probability function $\mathbb{P}(Y=y|X=x)$ is sufficiently smooth and the Tsybakov noise condition holds, our actively trained classifiers converge to the Bayes optimal classifier at a faster asymptotic rate than passively trained $k$-nearest neighbor classifiers.},

  abstract     = {Training data and model sizes are increasing exponentially. One way to reduce training time and resources is to train with a carefully selected subset of the full dataset. Prior work uses the gradient signals obtained during a warm-up or "pre-training" phase over the full dataset, for determining the core subset; if the pre-training phase is too small, the gradients obtained are chaotic and unreliable. As a result, the pre-training phase itself incurs significant time/resource overhead, and prior work has not gone beyond hyperparameter search to reduce pre-training time. We aim to reduce the "pre-training tax" in gradient-based subset training by developing a principled, scalable approach for pre-training in a distributed setup. Our approach is lightweight and minimizes communication between distributed worker nodes, being the first to utilize model-soup based distributed training at initialization.},

  abstract     = {Model fairness is an essential element for Trustworthy AI. While many techniques for model fairness have been proposed, most of them assume that the training and deployment data distributions are identical, which is often not true in practice. In particular, when the bias between labels and sensitive groups changes, the fairness of the trained model is directly influenced and can worsen. We make two contributions for solving this problem. First, we analytically show that existing in-processing fair algorithms have fundamental limits in accuracy and group fairness. We introduce the notion of correlation shifts, which can explicitly capture the change of the above bias. Second, we propose a novel pre-processing step that samples the input data to reduce correlation shifts and thus enables the in-processing approaches to overcome their limitations. We formulate an optimization problem for adjusting the data ratio among labels and sensitive groups to reflect the shifted correlation. A key benefit of our approach lies in decoupling the roles of pre- and in-processing approaches: correlation adjustment via pre-processing and unfairness mitigation on the processed data via in-processing. Experiments show that our framework effectively improves existing in-processing fair algorithms w.r.t. accuracy and fairness, both on synthetic and real datasets.},

We assume a discrete-time, stationary structural vector autoregressive process, with both temporal and contemporaneous causal relations. The presented algorithm gradually refines a causal graph by learning long-term temporal relations before short-term ones, where contemporaneous relations are learned last. This ordering of causal relations to be learnt leads to a reduction in the required number of statistical tests. We validate this reduction empirically and demonstrate that it leads to higher accuracy for synthetic data and more plausible causal graphs for real-world data compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Detecting such singularities is therefore crucial as a precursor to interpolation and inference tasks. We address this issue by developing a topological framework that (i) quantifies the local intrinsic dimension, and (ii) yields a Euclidicity score for assessing the 'manifoldness' of a point along multiple scales. Our approach identifies singularities of complex spaces, while also capturing singular structures and local geometric complexity in image data.},

While robust MDPs can provide reliable policies with limited data, their worst-case performances are often overly conservative, and so they do not offer practical insights into the actual performance of these reliable policies. This paper proposes robust satisficing MDPs (RSMDPs), where the expected returns of feasible policies are softly-constrained to achieve a user-specified target under ambiguity. We derive a tractable reformulation for RSMDPs and develop a first-order method for solving large instances. Experimental results demonstrate that RSMDPs can prescribe policies to achieve their targets, which are much higher than the optimal worst-case returns computed by robust MDPs.},

We describe an online algorithm with an equivalent smoothed regret guarantee, but which generates well-defined importance weights: in exchange, the online computational cost increases, but only to order smoothness (i.e., still independent of the action set). This removes a key obstacle to adoption of smoothed regret in production scenarios.},

We approach regularization in neural networks from a probabilistic perspective and show that by viewing parameter-space regularization as specifying an empirical prior distribution over the model parameters, we can derive a probabilistically well-motivated regularization technique that allows explicitly encoding information about desired predictive functions into neural network training. This method—which we refer to as function-space empirical Bayes (FS-EB)—includes both parameter- and function-space regularization, is mathematically simple, easy to implement, and incurs only minimal computational overhead compared to standard regularization techniques. We evaluate the utility of this regularization technique empirically and demonstrate that the proposed method leads to near-perfect semantic shift detection, highly-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates, successful task adaption from pre-trained models, and improved generalization under covariate shift.},

We further present a series of experiments on two common NLP tasks and evaluate multilingual compression and training data influence sparsity under different privacy guarantees, exploring these trade-offs in more detail.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new approach to automatically discovering accurate models of complex time series data. Working within a Bayesian nonparametric prior over a symbolic space of Gaussian process time series models, we present a novel structure learning algorithm that integrates sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and involutive MCMC for highly effective posterior inference. Our method can be used both in "online" settings, where new data is incorporated sequentially in time, and in "offline" settings, by using nested subsets of historical data to anneal the posterior. Empirical measurements on real-world time series show that our method can deliver 10x--100x runtime speedups over previous MCMC and greedy-search structure learning algorithms targeting the same model family. We used our method to perform the first large-scale evaluation of Gaussian process time series structure learning on a prominent benchmark of 1,428 econometric datasets.},

We make a monotonicity assumption stating that for each pair of experts, one outperforms the other on all tasks. We consider the sequential setting where in each round the learner has access to noisy evaluations of actively chosen pair of expert-task, given the information available up to the actual round. Given a confidence parameter $\delta \in (0, 1)$, we provide strategies allowing to recover the correct ranking of experts and develop a bound on the total number of queries made by our algorithm that hold with probability at least $1-\delta$. We show that our strategy is adaptive to the complexity of the problem (our bounds are instance dependent), and develop matching lower bounds up to a ploy-logarithmic factor. Finally, we adapt our strategy to the relaxed problem of best expert identification and provide numerical simulation consistent with our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose sample complexity bounds for learning a simplex from noisy samples. A dataset of size $n$ is given which includes i.i.d. samples drawn from a uniform distribution over an unknown arbitrary simplex in $\mathbb{R}^K$, where samples are assumed to be corrupted by a multi-variate additive Gaussian noise of an arbitrary magnitude. We prove the existence of an algorithm that with high probability outputs a simplex having a $\ell_2$ distance of at most $\varepsilon$ from the true simplex (for any $\varepsilon>0$). Also, we theoretically show that in order to achieve this bound, it is sufficient to have $n\ge\tilde{\Omega}\left(K^2/\varepsilon^2\right)e^{\Omega\left(K/\mathrm{SNR}^2\right)}$ samples, where $\mathrm{SNR}$ stands for the signal-to-noise ratio and is defined as the ratio of the maximum component-wise standard deviation of the simplex (signal) to that of the noise vector. This result solves an important open problem in this area of research, and shows as long as $\mathrm{SNR}\ge\Omega\left(\sqrt{K}\right)$ the sample complexity of the noisy regime has the same order to that of the noiseless case. Our proofs are a combination of the so-called sample compression technique in (Ashtiani et al., 2018), mathematical tools from high-dimensional geometry, and Fourier analysis. In particular, we have proposed a general Fourier-based technique for recovery of a more general class of distribution families from additive Gaussian noise, which can be further used in a variety of other related problems.},

  abstract     = {Contrastive Learning has recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of unimodal and multimodal tasks. Many contrastive learning approaches use mined hard negatives to make batches more informative during training but these approaches are inefficient as they increase epoch length proportional to the number of mined negatives and require frequent updates of nearest neighbor indices or mining from recent batches. In this work, we provide an alternative to hard negative mining, Global Contrastive Batch Sampling (GCBS), an efficient approximation to the batch assignment problem that upper bounds the gap between the global and training losses, $\mathcal{L}^{Global} - \mathcal{L}^{Train}$, in contrastive learning settings. Through experimentation we find GCBS improves state-of-the-art performance in sentence embedding and code-search tasks. Additionally, GCBS is easy to implement as it requires only a few additional lines of code, does not maintain external data structures such as nearest neighbor indices, is more computationally efficient than the most minimal hard negative mining approaches, and makes no changes to the model being trained. Code is available at https://github.com/vinayak1/GCBS.},

  abstract     = {During the recent years the interest of optimization and machine learning communities in high-probability convergence of stochastic optimization methods has been growing. One of the main reasons for this is that high-probability complexity bounds are more accurate and less studied than in-expectation ones. However, SOTA high-probability non-asymptotic convergence results are derived under strong assumptions such as boundedness of the gradient noise variance or of the objective's gradient itself. In this paper, we propose several algorithms with high-probability convergence results under less restrictive assumptions. In particular, we derive new high-probability convergence results under the assumption that the gradient/operator noise has bounded central $\alpha$-th moment for $\alpha \in (1,2\]$ in the following setups: (i) smooth non-convex / Polyak-Lojasiewicz / convex / strongly convex / quasi-strongly convex minimization problems, (ii) Lipschitz / star-cocoercive and monotone / quasi-strongly monotone variational inequalities. These results justify the usage of the considered methods for solving problems that do not fit standard functional classes studied in stochastic optimization.},

We uncover a novel connection between the AM dynamics and the inherent discrete assignment necessary in clustering to propose a novel unconstrained continuous relaxation of the discrete clustering problem, enabling end-to-end differentiable clustering with AM, dubbed ClAM. Leveraging the pattern completion ability of AMs, we further develop a novel self-supervised clustering loss. Our evaluations on varied datasets demonstrate that ClAM benefits from the self-supervision, and significantly improves upon both the traditional Lloyd's k-means algorithm, and more recent continuous clustering relaxations (by upto 60% in terms of the Silhouette Coefficient).},

To promote digital well-being, most platforms now offer a service that periodically prompts users to take breaks. These, however, must be set up manually, and so may be suboptimal for both users and the system. In this paper, we study the role of breaks in recommendation, and propose a framework for learning optimal breaking policies that promote and sustain long-term engagement. Based on the notion that recommendation dynamics are susceptible to both positive and negative feedback, we cast recommendation as a Lotka-Volterra dynamical system, where breaking reduces to a problem of optimal control. We then give an efficient learning algorithm, provide theoretical guarantees, and empirically demonstrate the utility of our approach on semi-synthetic data.},

Spectral methods based on the graph Laplacian and its generalization to the graph $p$-Laplacian have been a backbone of non-euclidean clustering techniques. The advantage of the $p$-Laplacian is that the parameter $p$ induces a controllable bias on cluster structure. The drawback of $p$-Laplacian eigenvector based methods is that the third and higher eigenvectors are difficult to compute. Thus, instead, we are motivated to use the $p$-resistance induced by the $p$-Laplacian for clustering. For $p$-resistance, small $p$ biases towards clusters with high internal connectivity while large $p$ biases towards clusters of small ``extent,'' that is a preference for smaller shortest-path distances between vertices in the cluster. However, the $p$-resistance is expensive to compute. We overcome this by developing an approximation to the $p$-resistance. We prove upper and lower bounds on this approximation and observe that it is exact when the graph is a tree. We also provide theoretical justification for the use of $p$-resistance for clustering. Finally, we provide experiments comparing our approximated $p$-resistance clustering to other $p$-Laplacian based methods.},

To circumvent this variance issue, we propose a new estimator, called OffCEM, that is based on the conjunct effect model (CEM), a novel decomposition of the causal effect into a cluster effect and a residual effect. OffCEM applies importance weighting only to action clusters and addresses the residual causal effect through model-based reward estimation. We show that the proposed estimator is unbiased under a new assumption, called local correctness, which only requires that the residual-effect model preserves the relative expected reward differences of the actions within each cluster. To best leverage the CEM and local correctness, we also propose a new two-step procedure for performing model-based estimation that minimizes bias in the first step and variance in the second step. We find that the resulting OffCEM estimator substantially improves bias and variance compared to a range of conventional estimators. Experiments demonstrate that OffCEM provides substantial improvements in OPE especially in the presence of many actions.},

  abstract     = {An emerging line of work has shown that machine-learned predictions are useful to warm-start algorithms for discrete optimization problems, such as bipartite matching. Previous studies have shown time complexity bounds proportional to some distance between a prediction and an optimal solution, which we can approximately minimize by learning predictions from past optimal solutions. However, such guarantees may not be meaningful when multiple optimal solutions exist. Indeed, the dual problem of bipartite matching and, more generally, L-/L$^{\natural}$-convex function minimization have arbitrarily many optimal solutions, making such prediction-dependent bounds arbitrarily large. To resolve this theoretically critical issue, we present a new warm-start-with-prediction framework for L-/L$^{\natural}$-convex function minimization. Our framework offers time complexity bounds proportional to the distance between a prediction and the set of all optimal solutions. The main technical difficulty lies in learning predictions that are provably close to sets of all optimal solutions, for which we present an online-gradient-descent-based method. We thus give the first polynomial-time learnability of predictions that can provably warm-start algorithms regardless of multiple optimal solutions.},

  abstract     = {Differentially Private methods for training Deep Neural Networks ({DNNs}) have progressed recently, in particular with the use of massive batches and aggregated data augmentations for a large number of training steps. These techniques require much more computing resources than their non-private counterparts, shifting the traditional privacy-accuracy trade-off to a privacy-accuracy-compute trade-off and making hyper-parameter search virtually impossible for realistic scenarios. In this work, we decouple privacy analysis and experimental behavior of noisy training to explore the trade-off with minimal computational requirements. We first use the tools of {Renyi} Differential Privacy ({RDP}) to highlight that the privacy budget, when not overcharged, only depends on the total amount of noise ({TAN}) injected throughout training. We then derive scaling laws for training models with {DP-SGD} to optimize hyper-parameters with more than a $100\times$ reduction in computational budget. We apply the proposed method on {CIFAR-10} and {ImageNet} and, in particular, strongly improve the state-of-the-art on {ImageNet} with a $+9$ points gain in top-1 accuracy for a privacy budget $\varepsilon=8$.},

In contrast to prior work, we do not assume any generative model for the data. We convert our training problem to a joint parameter estimation cum a subset selection problem, subject to a matroid span constraint. This allows us to reduce our problem into a constrained set function minimization problem, where the underlying objective is monotone and approximately submodular. We then propose a new joint discrete-continuous optimization algorithm that achieves a bounded approximation guarantee for our problem. We show that {PRESTO} outperforms several alternative methods. Finally, we study {PRESTO} in the context of resource-efficient deep learning, where we train smaller resource-constrained models on each partition and show that it outperforms existing data partitioning and model pruning/knowledge distillation approaches, which in contrast to {PRESTO}, require large initial (teacher) models.},

Using this framework, we create {OpinionQA}, a dataset for evaluating the alignment of {LM} opinions with those of 60 {US} demographic groups over topics ranging from abortion to automation. Across topics, we find substantial misalignment between the views reflected by current {LMs} and those of {US} demographic groups: on par with the Democrat-Republican divide on climate change. Notably, this misalignment persists even after explicitly steering the {LMs} towards particular groups. Our analysis not only confirms prior observations about the left-leaning tendencies of some human feedback-tuned {LMs}, but also surfaces groups whose opinions are poorly reflected by current {LMs} (e.g., 65+ and widowed individuals).},

In our analysis, we consider graph generation processes that are controlled by hidden (or latent) node features, which contain all information about the graph structure. A typical example of this framework is {kNN} graphs constructed from the hidden features. In our main results, we show that {GNNs} can recover the hidden node features from the input graph alone, even when all node features, including the hidden features themselves and any indirect hints, are unavailable.},

This paper studies the relationship between batch size and the number of steps needed for training {GANs} with {TTURs} based on constant learning rates. We theoretically show that, for a {TTUR} with constant learning rates, the number of steps needed to find stationary points of the loss functions of both the discriminator and generator decreases as the batch size increases and that there exists a critical batch size minimizing the stochastic first-order oracle ({SFO}) complexity. Then, we use the {Fr{\'e}chet} inception distance ({FID}) as the performance measure for training and provide numerical results indicating that the number of steps needed to achieve a low {FID} score decreases as the batch size increases and that the {SFO} complexity increases once the batch size exceeds the measured critical batch size. Moreover, we show that measured critical batch sizes are close to the sizes estimated from our theoretical results.},

They are thus much faster, but they currently remain far behind the state-of-the-art in large-scale text-to-image synthesis. This paper aims to identify the necessary steps to regain competitiveness. Our proposed model, StyleGAN-T, addresses the specific requirements of large-scale text-to-image synthesis, such as large capacity, stable training on diverse datasets, strong text alignment, and controllable variation vs. text alignment tradeoff. StyleGAN-T significantly improves over previous GANs and outperforms distilled diffusion models - the previous state-of-the-art in fast text-to-image synthesis - in terms of sample quality and speed.},

In particular, we show that identifiability up to potential shaping (Cao et al., 2021) is a consequence of entropy regularization and may generally no longer hold for other regularizations or in the presence of safety constraints. We also show that to ensure generalizability to new transition laws and constraints, the true reward must be identified up to a constant. Additionally, we derive a finite sample guarantee for the suboptimality of the learned rewards, and validate our results in a gridworld environment.},

Establishing this result requires proving a deterministic equivalent for traces of the deep random features sample covariance matrices which can be of independent interest. We conjecture the asymptotic Gaussian universality of the test error in the more general setting of arbitrary convex losses and generic learner/target architectures. We provide extensive numerical evidence for this conjecture, which requires the derivation of closed-form expressions for the layer-wise post-activation population covariances. In light of our results, we investigate the interplay between architecture design and implicit regularization.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a modality-agnostic neural compression algorithm based on a functional view of data and parameterised as an Implicit Neural Representation (INR). Bridging the gap between latent coding and sparsity, we obtain compact latent representations non-linearly mapped to a soft gating mechanism. This allows the specialisation of a shared INR network to each data item through subnetwork selection. After obtaining a dataset of such latent representations, we directly optimise the rate/distortion trade-off in a modality-agnostic space using neural compression. Variational Compression of Implicit Neural Representations (VC-INR) shows improved performance given the same representational capacity pre quantisation while also outperforming previous quantisation schemes used for other INR techniques. Our experiments demonstrate strong results over a large set of diverse modalities using the same algorithm without any modality-specific inductive biases.},

Here we study how the magnitude of this noise $T$ affects performance as the size of the training set $P$ and the scale of initialization $\alpha$ are varied. For gradient descent, $\alpha$ is a key parameter that controls if the network is `lazy' ($\alpha\gg1$) or instead learns features ($\alpha\ll1$). For classification of MNIST and CIFAR10 images, our central results are: (i) obtaining phase diagrams for performance in the $(\alpha,T)$ plane. They show that SGD noise can be detrimental or instead useful depending on the training regime. Moreover, although increasing $T$ or decreasing $\alpha$ both allow the net to escape the lazy regime, these changes can have opposite effects on performance.},

Moreover, we provide a convergence guarantee for the sequence of iterates to a solution of the variational inequality. These are the best theoretical convergence results for numerical methods for (only) monotone variational inequalities reported in the literature. To empirically validate our algorithm we investigate a two-player matrix game with mixed strategies of the two players.

Existing approaches address such covariate shift by either using the ratio p_te(x)/p_tr(x) to weight training samples (reweighted methods) or using the ratio p_tr(x)/p_te(x) to weight testing samples (robust methods). However, the performance of such approaches can be poor under support mismatch or when the above ratios take large values. We propose a minimax risk classification (MRC) approach for covariate shift adaptation that avoids such limitations by weighting both training and testing samples. In addition, we develop effective techniques that obtain both sets of weights and generalize the conventional kernel mean matching method.},

However, their predictive quality at activity prediction is lacking. In this work, we envision a novel type of activity prediction model that is able to adapt to new prediction tasks at inference time, via understanding textual information describing the task. To this end, we propose a new architecture with separate modules for chemical and natural language inputs, and a contrastive pretraining objective on data from large biochemical databases.

A natural way of modeling functional data is by learning operators between infinite dimensional spaces, leading to discretization invariant representations that scale independently of the sample grid resolution. In this work, we present Variational Autoencoding Neural Operators (VANO), a general strategy for making a large class of operator learning architectures act as variational autoencoders. For this purpose, we provide a novel rigorous mathematical formulation of the variational objective in function spaces for training. VANO first maps an input function to a distribution over a latent space using a parametric encoder and then decodes a sample from the latent distribution to reconstruct the input, as in classic variational autoencoders. We test VANO with different model setups and architecture choices for a variety of benchmarks, starting from a simple Gaussian random field where we can analytically track what the model learns, progressively transitioning to more challenging benchmarks including modeling phase separation in Cahn-Hilliard systems and real world satellite data for measuring Earth surface deformation.},

Here, we introduce an alternative, variational inference algorithm for Markov jump processes which relies on neural ordinary differential equations, and is trainable via back-propagation. Our methodology learns neural, continuous-time representations of the observed data, that are used to approximate the initial distribution and time-dependent transition probability rates of the posterior Markov jump process. We test our approach on synthetic data sampled from ground-truth Markov jump processes, experimental switching ion channel data and molecular dynamics simulations.},

The Student-t process generalizes the concept of a GP and hence yields a more flexible alternative. Unlike a GP, the predictive variance explicitly depends on the training observations, while the use of an entangled Student-t noise model preserves analytical tractability. Our approach also uses a Hilbert space reduced-rank representation of the TP kernel, derived from an eigenfunction expansion of the Laplace operator (Solin \& S\"{a}rkk\"{a}, 2020), to alleviate its computational complexity. Improvements in prediction and training time are demonstrated with real-world data sets.},

The model parameters can be learned via maximum likelihood, and the method can be adapted to any predictor network architecture and any type of prediction problem. Our method is a case of amortized interpretability models, where a neural network is used as a selector to allow for fast interpretation at inference time. Several popular interpretability methods are shown to be particular cases of regularised maximum likelihood for our general model.

  abstract     = {Gradient-based methods for value estimation in reinforcement learning have favorable stability properties, but they are typically much slower than Temporal Difference (TD) learning methods. We study the root causes of this slowness and show that Mean Square Bellman Error (MSBE) is an ill-conditioned loss function in the sense that its Hessian has large condition-number. To resolve the adverse effect of poor conditioning of MSBE on gradient based methods, we propose a low complexity batch-free proximal method that approximately follows the Gauss-Newton direction and is asymptotically robust to parameterization. Our main algorithm, called RANS, is efficient in the sense that it is significantly faster than the residual gradient methods while having almost the same computational complexity, and is competitive with TD on the classic problems that we tested.},

In this paper, we introduce a suite of new particle-based methods for scalable Bayesian inference based on coin betting, which are entirely learning-rate free. We illustrate the performance of our approach on a range of numerical examples, including several high-dimensional models and datasets, demonstrating comparable performance to other ParVI algorithms with no need to tune a learning rate.},

In short, suppose we are interested in detecting changepoints in some parameter or functional θ of the underlying distribution. We demonstrate that if we can construct a confidence sequence (CS) for θ, then we can also successfully perform SCD for θ. This is accomplished by checking if two CSs — one forwards and the other backwards — ever fail to intersect. Since the literature on CSs has been rapidly evolving recently, the reduction provided in this paper immediately solves several old and new change detection problems. Further, our backward CS, constructed by reversing time, is new and potentially of independent interest. We provide strong nonasymptotic guarantees on the frequency of false alarms and detection delay, and demonstrate numerical effectiveness on several problems.},

The state-of-the art in this family, the Gumbel-Rao estimator uses an extra internal sampling to reduce the variance, which may be costly. We analyze this estimator and show that it possesses a zero temperature limit with a surprisingly simple closed form. The limit estimator, called ZGR, has favorable bias and variance properties, it is easy to implement and computationally inexpensive. It decomposes as the average of the straight through (ST) estimator and DARN estimator — two basic but not very well performing on their own estimators.},

Instead, we aim to analyze the fundamental limits of MSFDA.

In this paper, we propose TimeDiff, a non-autoregressive diffusion model that achieves high-quality time series prediction with the introduction of two novel conditioning mechanisms: future mixup and autoregressive initialization. Similar to teacher forcing, future mixup allows parts of the ground-truth future predictions for conditioning, while autoregressive initialization helps better initialize the model with basic time series patterns such as short-term trends. Extensive experiments are performed on nine real-world datasets. Results show that TimeDiff consistently outperforms existing time series diffusion models, and also achieves the best overall performance across a variety of the existing strong baselines (including transformers and FiLM).},

  abstract     = {We consider solving sequential decision-making problems in the scenario where the agent has access to two supervision sources: reward signal and a teacher that can be queried to obtain a good action for any state encountered by the agent. Learning solely from rewards, or reinforcement learning, is data inefficient and may not learn high-reward policies in challenging scenarios involving sparse rewards or partial observability. On the other hand, learning from a teacher may sometimes be infeasible. For instance, the actions provided by a teacher with privileged information may be unlearnable by an agent with limited information (i.e., partial observability). In other scenarios, the teacher might be sub-optimal, and imitating their actions can limit the agent's performance. To overcome these challenges, prior work proposed to jointly optimize imitation and reinforcement learning objectives but relied on heuristics and problem-specific hyper-parameter tuning to balance the two objectives. We introduce Teacher Guided Reinforcement Learning (TGRL), a principled approach to dynamically balance following the teacher's guidance and leveraging RL. The main idea is to adjust the importance of teacher supervision by comparing the agent's performance to the counterfactual scenario of the agent learning without teacher supervision and only from rewards. If using teacher supervision improves performance, the importance of teacher supervision is increased and otherwise it is decreased. TGRL outperforms strong baselines across diverse domains without hyperparameter tuning.},

However, their fundamental limits, the performance of gradient methods and the features learnt during optimization remain poorly understood, even in the two-layer setting. In fact, earlier work has considered either linear autoencoders or specific training regimes (leading to vanishing or diverging compression rates). Our paper addresses this gap by focusing on non-linear two-layer autoencoders trained in the challenging proportional regime in which the input dimension scales linearly with the size of the representation. Our results characterize the minimizers of the population risk, and show that such minimizers are achieved by gradient methods; their structure is also unveiled, thus leading to a concise description of the features obtained via training. For the special case of a sign activation function, our analysis establishes the fundamental limits for the lossy compression of Gaussian sources via (shallow) autoencoders. Finally, while the results are proved for Gaussian data, numerical simulations on standard datasets display the universality of the theoretical predictions.},

In particular, we introduce Grade-School Math with Irrelevant Context (GSM-IC), an arithmetic reasoning dataset with irrelevant information in the problem description. We use this benchmark to measure the distractibility of different prompting techniques for large language models, and find that the model is easily distracted by irrelevant information. We also identify several approaches for mitigating this deficiency, such as decoding with self-consistency and adding to the prompt an instruction that tells the language model to ignore the irrelevant information.},

  abstract     = {User embeddings (vectorized representations of a user) are essential in recommendation systems. Numerous approaches have been proposed to construct a representation for the user in order to find similar items for retrieval tasks, and they have been proven effective in industrial recommendation systems. Recently people have discovered the power of using multiple embeddings to represent a user, with the hope that each embedding represents the user's interest in a certain topic. With multi-interest representation, it's important to model the user's preference over the different topics and how the preference changes with time. However, existing approaches either fail to estimate the user's affinity to each interest or unreasonably assume every interest of every user fades at an equal rate with time, thus hurting the performance of candidate retrieval. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Interest Preference (MIP) model, an approach that not only produces multi-interest for users by using the user's sequential engagement more effectively but also automatically learns a set of weights to represent the preference over each embedding so that the candidates can be retrieved from each interest proportionally. Extensive experiments have been done on various industrial-scale datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

Thus, such algorithms could violate instantaneous hard constraints and traverse unsafe states (and actions) in practice. Hence, in this paper, we develop the first near-optimal safe RL algorithm for episodic Markov Decision Processes with unsafe states and actions under instantaneous hard constraints and the linear mixture model.},

Moreover, increasingly heavier models, e.g., Transformers, have attracted the attention of researchers to model compression. However, how to compress multimodal models, especially vison-language Transformers, is still under-explored. This paper proposes the Unified and Progressive Pruning (UPop) as a universal vison-language Transformer compression framework, which incorporates 1) unifiedly searching multimodal subnets in a continuous optimization space from the original model, which enables automatic assignment of pruning ratios among compressible modalities and structures; 2) progressively searching and retraining the subnet, which maintains convergence between the search and retrain to attain higher compression ratios. Experiments on various tasks, datasets, and model architectures demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed UPop framework.},

Specifically, by adjusting the relaxation degree of constraints in the inner minimization, we obtain three contrastive losses and show that the dominant contrastive loss in literature InfoNCE falls into one of these losses.},

To address this, we propose Long Horizon Temperature Scaling (LHTS), a novel approach for sampling from temperature-scaled joint distributions.

This allows neural network training to be analyzed from the perspective of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), which is informative in the over-parametrized regime, but a poor approximation for narrower networks as the weights change more during training. Our goal is to extend beyond the limits of NTK toward a more general theory. We construct an exact power-series representation of the neural network in a finite neighborhood of the initial weights as an inner product of two feature maps, respectively from data and weight-step space, to feature space, allowing neural network training to be analyzed from the perspective of reproducing kernel Banach space (RKBS).},

Contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) models have shown impressive zero-shot ability, but the further adaptation of CLIP on downstream tasks undesirably degrades OOD performances. This paper aims at generalizing CLIP to out-of-distribution test data on downstream tasks. We propose CLIPood, a fine-tuning method that can adapt CLIP models to OOD situations where both domain shifts and open classes may occur on the unseen test data. To exploit the semantic relations between classes from the text modality, CLIPood introduces a new training objective, margin metric softmax (MMS), with class adaptive margins for fine-tuning. To incorporate both pre-trained zero-shot model and fine-tuned task-adaptive model, CLIPood leverages a new optimization strategy, Beta moving average (BMA), to maintain a temporal ensemble weighted by Beta distribution. Experiments on diverse datasets with different OOD scenarios show that CLIPood consistently outperforms existing generalization techniques.},

The energy objective is determinant-free and supports flexible model architectures that are not easily compatible with maximum likelihood training, including semi-autoregressive energy flows, a novel model family that interpolates between fully autoregressive and non-autoregressive models. Energy flows feature competitive sample quality, posterior inference, and generation speed relative to likelihood-based flows; this performance is decorrelated from the quality of log-likelihood estimates, which are generally very poor. Our findings question the use of maximum likelihood as an objective or a metric, and contribute to a scientific study of its role in generative modeling.},

Solving this problem requires prior knowledge, which is commonly incorporated by imposing regularity conditions on the source signals, or implicitly learned through supervised or unsupervised methods from existing data. While data-driven methods have shown great promise in source separation, they often require large amounts of data, which rarely exists in planetary space missions. To address this challenge, we propose an unsupervised source separation scheme for domains with limited data access that involves solving an optimization problem in the wavelet scattering covariance representation space---an interpretable, low-dimensional representation of stationary processes. We present a real-data example in which we remove transient, thermally-induced microtilts---known as glitches---from data recorded by a seismometer during {NASA}'s {InSight} mission on {Mars}. Thanks to the wavelet scattering covariances' ability to capture non-{Gaussian} properties of stochastic processes, we are able to separate glitches using only a few glitch-free data snippets.},

Furthermore, we establish sharp quantitative bounds on the approximation error in terms of the number of hidden units. In particular, our results imply that the approximation error decreases exponentially fast (i.e., at a rate $2^{-cn}$ for some constant $c > 0$) in the number of hidden units in each layer for the class of H\"{o}lder continuous densities. Our proof technique relies on a careful analysis of the Barron space of functions, which allows us to exploit the specific structure of deep belief networks.},

We show that the generalization error under distribution shift can be a non-monotonic function of the number of OOD training samples. In other words, there is value in training on small amounts of OOD data. This paper builds the first theoretical foundation for understanding this counter-intuitive phenomenon by analyzing the multi-environment setting through the lens of bias-variance tradeoffs. We show that the bias and variance terms have competing effects that can lead to a non-monotonic generalization error as a function of the amount of OOD data used in training. We demonstrate this non-monotonic behavior empirically using Fisher's Linear Discriminant on synthetic datasets and deep networks on computer vision benchmarks such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, CINIC-10, PACS and DomainNet. Finally, we present practical guidelines for when to include OOD data in training.},

When designing pricing experiments, there are three fundamental objectives: estimating the causal effect of price (i.e., price elasticity), maximizing the expected revenue through the experiment, and controlling the tail risk of suffering from a very huge loss. In this paper, we reveal the relationship among such three objectives. Under a linear structural model, we investigate the trade-offs between causal inference and expected revenue maximization, as well as between expected revenue maximization and tail risk control. Furthermore, we propose an optimal pricing experimental design, which can flexibly adapt to different desired levels of trade-offs. Through the optimal design, we also explore the relationship between causal inference and tail risk control.},

We model heterogeneous environments by letting the marginal distributions of $(x,y)$ vary across environments while keeping the structural functions $f^*, g^*$ invariant. We establish a finite-sample excess risk bound for the natural two-step estimator that first estimates $f^*$ and $g^*$ separately, then combines them. Our bound captures how the complexity of the function classes and the heterogeneity across environments affect the excess risk. In particular, we show that when the marginal distributions vary significantly across environments, we can achieve a better excess risk compared to the naive approach of treating $(x,y)$ as a single covariate. We complement this result with a minimax lower bound and provide empirical validation on synthetic and real data.},

We study a linearized model of Barlow Twins applicable to infinitely wide networks, and solve the training dynamics exactly from small initialization.

The HL algorithms achieve data efficiency by leveraging a key insight: having samples of the exogenous variables, past decisions can be revisited in hindsight to infer counterfactual consequences that can accelerate policy improvements. We guide policy search with informative improvement signals computed by hindsight planning algorithms developed in the operations research literature, which can efficiently solve for the optimal sequence of actions for a given sequence of exogenous inputs. The HL algorithms can quickly learn policies that are ``optimal for most exogenous inputs'', which reduces the sample and computational costs of policy search.},

  abstract     = {Decision-based adversarial attacks construct inputs that fool a machine-learning model into making targeted mispredictions by making only hard-label queries. For the most part, these attacks have been applied directly to isolated neural network models. However, in practice, machine learning models are just a component of a much larger system. We find that by adding just a single preprocessor in front of a classifier, state-of-the-art query-based attacks are as much as seven times less effective at attacking a prediction pipeline than attacking the machine learning model alone. Most preprocessors introduce some notion of invariance to the input space. Hence, attacks that are unaware of this invariance inevitably waste a large number of queries to re-discover or overcome it. We develop techniques to first reverse-engineer the preprocessor and then use this extracted information to attack the end-to-end system. Our extraction method requires only a few hundred queries to learn the preprocessors used by most publicly available model pipelines, and our preprocessor-aware attacks recover the same efficacy as just attacking the model alone.},

  abstract     = {It is often very challenging to manually design reward functions for complex, real-world tasks. To solve this, one can instead use reward learning to infer a reward function from data. However, there are often multiple reward functions that fit the data equally well, even in the infinite-data limit, meaning the reward function is only partially identifiable. We formally characterise the partial identifiability of the reward function given several popular reward learning data sources, including expert demonstrations and trajectory comparisons. We also analyse the impact of this partial identifiability for several downstream tasks, such as policy optimisation. We unify our results in a framework for comparing data sources and downstream tasks by their invariances, with implications for the design and selection of data sources for reward learning.},

The scale meta-learner ({SML}) transforms the context embedding for subsequent adaptation of {SAGE} based on scale information. {SAGE} adjusts the model parameters dedicated to the context embedding for a specific instance, introducing locality bias which encourages selecting nearby locations to determine the next location, with the locality bias gradually decaying as the model is adapted to the target instance. Results show that {Meta-SAGE} outperforms previous adaptation methods and significantly improves scalability in representative {CO} tasks.},

At its core, {IsEM-Pro} is a latent generative model, augmented by combinatorial structure features from a separately learned {Markov} random fields ({MRFs}). We develop a {Monte Carlo} Expectation-Maximization method ({MCEM}) to learn the model. During inference, sampling from its latent space enhances diversity while its {MRFs} features guide the exploration in high fitness regions. Experiments on eight protein sequence design tasks show that our {IsEM-Pro} outperforms the previous best methods by at least 55\% on average fitness score and generates more diverse and novel protein sequences.},

They support fast one-step generation by design, while still allowing multistep sampling to trade compute for sample quality. They also support zero-shot data editing, such as image inpainting, colorization, and super-resolution, without requiring explicit training on these tasks. Consistency models can be trained either by distilling pre-trained diffusion models, or as standalone generative models altogether. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that consistency models outperform existing distillation techniques for diffusion models in one- and few-step sampling.},

However, {RL}-trained policies often suffer from the action fluctuation problem, where the consecutive actions significantly differ despite only slight state variations. This problem results in mechanical components' wear and tear and poses safety hazards. The action fluctuation is caused by the high {Lipschitz} constant of actor networks. To address this problem, we propose a neural network named {LipsNet}. We propose the Multi-dimensional Gradient Normalization ({MGN}) method, to constrain the {Lipschitz} constant of networks with multi-dimensional input and output. Benefiting from {MGN}, {LipsNet} achieves {Lipschitz} continuity, allowing smooth actions while preserving control performance by adjusting {Lipschitz} constant. {LipsNet} addresses the action fluctuation problem at network level rather than algorithm level, which can serve as actor networks in most {RL} algorithms, making it more flexible and user-friendly than previous works. Experiments demonstrate that {LipsNet} has good landscape smoothness and noise robustness, resulting in significantly smoother action compared to the Multilayer Perceptron.},

Specifically, we learn image perturbations to amend the data distribution of training set to improve the performance of networks. This optimization w.r.t data distribution is non-trivial. To approach this, we tactfully construct a differentiable optimization target w.r.t. image perturbations via minimizing the empirical risk.

However, in this paper, we argue that there is a strongly interacting group effect between the influences of graph elements due to their connectivity. In the same vein, we observe that edge groups connecting to the same train node exhibit significant differences in their influences, hence no matter how negative each is, removing them at once may have a rather negative effect as a group. This work scrutinizes the trend that there exists an influence estimation error of an edge group in graph influence function and this error might decrease the performance in graph rectification. Thus, we propose {RGE}, which eliminates distant edges at each iteration in graph rectification, and demonstrate the effectiveness of {RGE} on various graphs.},

Significant research efforts have been devoted to develop advanced algorithms that deal with the situation where the data at individual clients have heterogeneous distributions. In this work, we show that data heterogeneity can be dealt from a different perspective. By utilizing a certain overparameterized multi-layer neural network at each client, even the vanilla {FedAvg} (a.k.a. the Local {SGD}) algorithm can accurately optimize the training problem: When each client has a neural network with one wide layer of size N (where N is the number of total training samples), followed by layers of smaller widths, {FedAvg} converges linearly to a solution that achieves (almost) zero training loss, without requiring any assumptions on the clients' data distributions. To our knowledge, this is the first work that demonstrates such resilience to data heterogeneity for {FedAvg} when trained on multi-layer neural networks. Our experiments also confirm that, neural networks of large size can achieve better and more stable performance for {FL} problems.},

  abstract     = {In the context of structure-to-structure transformation tasks, learning sequences of discrete symbolic operations poses significant challenges due to their non-differentiability. To facilitate the learning of these symbolic sequences, we introduce a differentiable tree interpreter that compiles high-level symbolic tree operations into subsymbolic matrix operations on tensors. We present a novel Differentiable Tree Machine ({DTM}) architecture that integrates our interpreter with an external memory and an agent that learns to sequentially select tree operations to execute the target transformation in an end-to-end manner. With respect to out-of-distribution compositional generalization on synthetic semantic parsing and language generation tasks, {DTM} achieves 100\% while existing baselines such as Transformer, Tree Transformer, {LSTM}, and Tree2Tree {LSTM} achieve less than 30\%.},

  abstract     = {Causal disentanglement seeks a representation of data involving latent variables that are related via a causal model. A representation is identifiable if both the latent model and the transformation from latent to observed variables are unique. In this paper, we study observed variables that are a linear transformation of a linear latent causal model. Data from interventions are necessary for identifiability: if one latent variable is missing an intervention, we show that there exist distinct models that cannot be distinguished. Conversely, we show that a single intervention on each latent variable is sufficient for identifiability. Our proof uses a generalization of the RQ decomposition of a matrix that replaces the usual orthogonal and upper triangular conditions with analogues depending on a partial order on the rows of the matrix, with partial order determined by a latent causal model. We corroborate our theoretical results with a method for causal disentanglement. We show that the method accurately recovers a latent causal model on synthetic and semi-synthetic data and we illustrate a use case on a dataset of single-cell RNA sequencing measurements.},

  abstract     = {{AI} assistance continues to help advance applications in education, from language learning to intelligent tutoring systems, yet current methods for providing students feedback are still quite limited. Most automatic feedback systems either provide binary correctness feedback, which may not help a student understand how to improve, or require hand-coding feedback templates, which may not generalize to new domains. This can be particularly challenging for physical control tasks, where the rich diversity in student behavior and specialized domains make it challenging to leverage general-purpose assistive tools for providing feedback. We design and build {CORGI}, a model trained to generate language corrections for physical control tasks, such as learning to ride a bike. {CORGI} is designed for three diverse physical control tasks (drawing, steering, and joint movement) and takes in as input a pair of student and expert trajectories, then generates natural language corrections to help the student improve. To train {CORGI}, we collected over 2k crowdsourced corrections for pair-wise (student, expert) trajectories, and further augmented the data with large language-model assistance.},

Among all {TPP} models, {H}awkes processes have proven to be the most widely used, mainly due to their adequate modeling for various applications, particularly when considering exponential or non-parametric kernels. Although non-parametric kernels are an option, such models require large datasets. While exponential kernels are more data efficient and relevant for specific applications where events immediately trigger more events, they are ill-suited for applications where latencies need to be estimated, such as in neuroscience. This work aims to offer an efficient solution to {TPP} inference using general parametric kernels with finite support. The developed solution consists of a fast $\ell_2$ gradient-based solver leveraging a discretized version of the events, making it particularly useful for applications like neuroscience where latency estimation is important.},

However, existing systems typically require experts to understand when to cede agency to the system or when to exercise their own agency. Otherwise, the experts may be better off solving the classification tasks on their own. In this work, we develop an automated decision support system that, by design, does not require experts to understand when to trust the system to improve performance. Rather than providing (single) label predictions and letting experts decide when to trust these predictions, our system provides sets of label predictions constructed using conformal prediction---prediction sets---and forcefully asks experts to predict labels from these sets. By using conformal prediction, our system can precisely trade-off the probability that the true label is not in the prediction set, which determines how frequently our system will mislead the experts, and the size of the prediction set, which determines the difficulty of the classification task the experts need to solve using our system. We develop an efficient and near-optimal search method to find the conformal predictor under which the experts benefit the most from using our system. Simulation experiments using synthetic and real expert predictions demonstrate that our system may help experts make more accurate predictions and is robust to the accuracy of the classifier the conformal predictor relies on.},

  abstract     = {Streaming speech recognition architectures are employed for low-latency, real-time applications. Such architectures are often characterized by their causality. Causal architectures emit tokens at each frame, relying only on current and past signal, while non-causal models are exposed to a window of future frames at each step to increase predictive accuracy. This dichotomy amounts to a trade-off for real-time Automatic Speech Recognition ({ASR}) system design: profit from the low-latency benefit of strictly-causal architectures while accepting predictive performance limitations, or realize the modeling benefits of future-context models accompanied by their higher latency penalty. In this work, we relax the constraints of this choice and present the Adaptive Non-Causal Attention Transducer ({ANCAT}). The architecture is non-causal in the traditional sense, but executes in a low-latency, streaming manner by dynamically choosing when to rely on future context and to what degree within the audio stream. The resulting mechanism, when coupled with our novel regularization algorithms, delivers comparable accuracy to non-causal configurations while improving significantly upon latency, closing the gap with their causal counterparts. We showcase our design experimentally by reporting comparative {ASR} task results with measures of accuracy and latency on both publicly accessible and production-scale, voice-assistant datasets.},

  abstract     = {Image segmentation is a largely researched field where neural networks find vast applications in many facets of technology. Some of the most popular approaches to train segmentation networks employ loss functions optimizing pixel-overlap, an objective that is insufficient for many segmentation tasks. In recent years, their limitations fueled a growing interest in topology-aware methods, which aim to recover the correct topology of the segmented structures. However, so far, existing methods only consider global topological properties, ignoring the need to preserve topological features spatially, which is crucial for accurate segmentation. We introduce the concept of induced matchings from persistent homology to achieve a spatially correct matching between persistence barcodes in a segmentation setting. Based on this concept, we define the Betti matching error as an interpretable, topologically and feature-wise accurate metric for image segmentations, which resolves the limitations of previous approaches. Our Betti matching error is differentiable and efficient to use as a loss function. We demonstrate that it improves the topological performance of segmentation networks significantly across six diverse datasets while preserving the performance with respect to traditional scores.},

  abstract     = {Incremental learning is a machine learning approach that involves training a model on a sequence of tasks, rather than all tasks at once. This ability to learn incrementally from a stream of tasks is crucial for many real-world applications. However, incremental learning is a challenging problem on graph-structured data, as many graph-related problems involve prediction tasks for each individual node, known as Node-wise Graph Incremental Learning (NGIL). This introduces non-independent and non-identically distributed characteristics in the sample data generation process, making it difficult to maintain the performance of the model as new tasks are added. In this paper, we focus on the inductive NGIL problem, which accounts for the evolution of graph structure (structural shift) induced by emerging tasks. We provide a formal formulation and analysis of the problem, and propose a novel regularization-based technique called Structural-Shift-Risk-Mitigation (SSRM) to mitigate the impact of the structural shift on catastrophic forgetting of the inductive NGIL problem. We show that the structural shift can lead to a shift in the input distribution for the existing tasks, and further lead to an increased risk of catastrophic forgetting. Through comprehensive empirical studies with several benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed method, Structural-Shift-Risk-Mitigation (SSRM), is flexible and easy to adapt to improve the performance of state-of-the-art GNN incremental learning frameworks in the inductive setting.},

DUET representations maintain information about an input transformation, while remaining semantically expressive. Compared to SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020) (unstructured and invariant) and ESSL (Dangovski et al., 2022) (unstructured and equivariant), the structured and equivariant nature of DUET representations enables controlled generation with lower reconstruction error, while controllability is not possible with SimCLR or ESSL.

They can provide significant variance reduction, but usually require a large number of samples, which can be prohibitive when sampling or evaluating the integrand is computationally expensive. Furthermore, there are many scenarios where we need to compute multiple related integrals simultaneously or sequentially, which can further exacerbate computational costs. In this paper, we propose vector-valued control variates, an extension of control variates which can be used to reduce the variance of multiple Monte Carlo estimators jointly.},

To address this issue, the authors propose MetaModulation, a method for few-shot learning with fewer tasks. The key idea is to use a neural network to increase the density of the meta-training tasks by modulating batch normalization parameters during meta-training. Additionally, they modify parameters at various network levels, rather than just a single layer, to increase task diversity. To account for the uncertainty caused by the limited training tasks, they propose a variational MetaModulation where the modulation parameters are treated as latent variables.},

Recent work has favored data-driven approaches that mitigate the need for hand-craft heuristics, but these are often not usable as out-of-the-box solvers due to dependence on in-distribution training and limited scalability to large instances. In this paper, we revisit the idea of using sampling for combinatorial optimization, motivated by the significant recent advances of gradient-based discrete MCMC and new techniques for parallel neighborhood exploration on accelerators. Remarkably, we find that modern sampling strategies can leverage landscape information to provide general-purpose solvers that require no training and yet are competitive with state of the art combinatorial solvers.},

The problem is also known as predictive analytics or contextual linear programming. The existing approaches largely suffer from either optimization intractability (a non-convex objective function)/statistical inefficiency (a suboptimal generalization bound) or requiring strong condition(s) such as no constraint or loss calibration. We develop a new approach to the problem called maximum optimality margin which designs the machine learning loss function by the optimality condition of the downstream optimization. The max-margin formulation enjoys both computational efficiency and good theoretical properties for the learning procedure. More importantly, our new approach only needs the observations of the optimal solution in the training data rather than the objective function, which makes it a new and natural approach to the inverse linear programming problem under both contextual and context-free settings; we also analyze the proposed method under both offline and online settings, and demonstrate its performance using numerical experiments.},

Error feedback has been used to guarantee the convergence of signSGD under weaker assumptions at the cost of communication overhead. This paper revisits the convergence of signSGD and proves that momentum can remedy signSGD under weaker assumptions than previous techniques; in particular, our convergence theory does not require the assumption of bounded stochastic gradient or increased batch size. Our results resonate with echoes of previous empirical results where, unlike signSGD, signSGD with momentum maintains good performance even with small batch sizes. Another new result is that signSGD with momentum can achieve an improved convergence rate when the objective function is second-order smooth. We further extend our theory to signSGD with major vote and federated learning.},

While the advancements in deep learning have spurred the utilization of 3D point clouds, deep models are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Various defense solutions have been proposed to build robust models against adversarial attacks. In this work, we pinpoint a major limitation of the leading empirical defense, adversarial training, when applied to 3D point cloud models: gradient obfuscation, which significantly hampers robustness against potent attacks. To bridge the gap, we propose PointDP, a purification strategy that leverages diffusion models to defend against 3D adversarial attacks. Since PointDP does not rely on predefined adversarial examples for training, it can defend against a variety of threats. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of PointDP across six representative 3D point cloud architectures, employing sixteen strong and adaptive attacks to manifest its foundational robustness. Our evaluation shows that PointDP achieves significantly better (i.e., 12.6%-40.3%) adversarial robustness than state-of-the-art methods under strong attacks bounded by different ℓp norms.},

This work presents a new score-decomposed diffusion model (SDDM) on manifolds to explicitly optimize the tangled distributions during image generation. SDDM derives manifolds to make the distributions of adjacent time steps separable and decompose the score function or energy guidance into an image "denoising" part and a content "refinement" part. To refine the image in the same noise level, we equalize the refinement parts of the score function and energy guidance, which permits multi-objective optimization on the manifold. We also leverage the block adaptive instance normalization module to construct manifolds with lower dimensions but still concentrated with the perturbed reference image. SDDM outperforms existing SBDM-based methods with much fewer diffusion steps on several I2I benchmarks.},

However, this study shows that significant information is often lost in the low-resolution down-sampled features. To address such issues, we propose a new approach, namely Temporal Stencil Modeling (TSM), which combines the strengths of advanced time-series sequence modeling (with the HiPPO features) and state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers (with learnable stencil modeling). TSM aims to recover the lost information from the PDE trajectories and can be regarded as a temporal generalization of classic finite volume methods such as WENO.},

Recently, many methods have studied the representations of GNNs from the perspective of optimization goals and spectral graph theory. However, the feature space that dominates representation learning has not been systematically studied in graph neural networks. In this paper, we propose to fill this gap by analyzing the feature space of both spatial and spectral models. We decompose graph neural networks into determined feature spaces and trainable weights, providing the convenience of studying the feature space explicitly using matrix space analysis. In particular, we theoretically find that the feature space tends to be linearly correlated due to repeated aggregations. Motivated by these findings, we propose 1) feature subspaces flattening and 2) structural principal components to expand the feature space. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed more comprehensive feature space, with comparable inference time to the baseline, and demonstrate its efficient convergence capability.},

However, due to inevitable model errors, straightforwardly learning a policy in the model typically fails in the offline setting. Previous studies have incorporated conservatism to prevent out-of-distribution exploration. For example, MOPO penalizes rewards through uncertainty measures from predicting the next states, which are loose bounds of the ideal uncertainty, i.e., the Bellman error. In this paper, we propose MOBILE (MOdel-Bellman Inconsistency penalized offLinE Policy Optimization), a novel uncertainty-driven offline RL algorithm. MOBILE conducts uncertainty quantification through the inconsistency of Bellman estimations under an ensemble of learned dynamics models, which can be a better approximator to the true Bellman error, and penalizes the Bellman estimation based on this uncertainty. Empirically, we verify that our proposed uncertainty quantification can be significantly closer to the true Bellman error than the compared methods. Consequently, MOBILE outperforms prior offline RL approaches on most tasks of D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning is pervasive. It powers recommender systems such as Spotify, Instagram and YouTube, and health-care systems via models that predict sleep patterns, or the risk of disease. Individuals contribute data to these models and benefit from them. Are these contributions (outflows of influence) and benefits (inflows of influence) reciprocal? We propose measures of outflows, inflows and reciprocity building on previously proposed measures of training data influence. Data is pooled across entities (individuals or enterprises) to create machine learning models, and sometimes, the entities that contribute the data also benefit from the models. In this work we propose a framework to study this value exchange, i.e., we model and measure contributions (outflows), benefits (inflows) and the balance between contributions and benefits (the degree of reciprocity). Our initial theoretical and empirical results indicate that under certain distributional assumptions, some classes of models are approximately reciprocal.},

In this work, we show models that are personalized with group attributes can reduce performance at a group level -- meaning groups may receive unnecessarily inaccurate predictions by sharing their personal characteristics. We present formal conditions to ensure the ``fair use'' of group attributes in a prediction task, and describe how they can be checked by training one additional model. We call these collective preference guarantees to ensure that each group who provides personal data will receive a tailored gain in performance in return. We present sufficient conditions to ensure fair use in empirical risk minimization and characterize failure modes that lead to fair use violations due to standard practices in model development and deployment. We include a comprehensive empirical study of fair use in clinical prediction tasks, demonstrating the prevalence of fair use violations in practice and illustrating simple interventions to mitigate their harm.},

  abstract     = {Many existing reinforcement learning methods employ stochastic gradient iteration whose stability hinges upon a hypothesis that the data-generating process mixes exponentially fast with a rate parameter that appears in the step-size selection. Unfortunately, this assumption is violated for large state spaces or settings with sparse rewards, and the mixing time is unknown, making the step size inoperable. To solve this problem, we propose an RL methodology attuned to the mixing time by employing a multi-level Monte Carlo estimator for the critic, the actor, and the average reward embedded within an actor-critic algorithm. This method, called Multi-level Actor-Critic (MAC), is developed especially for infinite-horizon average-reward settings and neither relies on oracle knowledge of the mixing time in its parameter selection nor assumes its exponential decay; it, therefore, is readily applicable to applications with slower mixing times. We prove that our approach finds an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy using $\tilde{O}(T_{mix} \varepsilon^{-2})$ episodes, where $T_{mix}$ is the mixing time. This bound is minimax optimal when the mixing time is at most polynomial in the size of the state space.},

Specifically, graph embedding in hyperbolic space has experimentally succeeded in embedding graphs with hierarchical-tree structure, e.g., data in natural languages, social networks, and knowledge bases. However, recent theoretical analyses have shown a much higher upper bound on non-Euclidean graph embedding's generalization error than Euclidean one's, where a high generalization error indicates that the incompleteness and noise in the data can significantly damage learning performance. It implies that the existing bound cannot guarantee the success of graph embedding in non-Euclidean metric space in a practical training data size, which can prevent non-Euclidean graph embedding's application in real problems. This paper provides a tight and fast generalization bound for graph embedding in non-Euclidean metric space to fill this gap.},

We propose the P-learner, motivated by the R- and DR-learner, which is a tailored two-stage loss function for learning heterogeneous treatment effects in settings where exchangeability given observed covariates is an implausible assumption, and where researchers wish to rely on proxy variables for causal inference. The proposed estimator can be implemented by off-the-shelf loss-minimizing machine learning methods, which in the case of kernel regression satisfies an oracle bound on the estimated error as long as the nuisance components are estimated reasonably well.},

Unfortunately, traditional IRL methods suffer from a computational weakness: they require repeatedly solving a hard reinforcement learning (RL) problem as a subroutine. This is counter-intuitive from the viewpoint of reductions: we have reduced the easier problem of imitation learning to repeatedly solving the harder problem of RL. Another thread of work has proved that access to the side-information of the distribution of states where a strong policy spends time can dramatically reduce the sample and computational complexities of solving an RL problem. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time a more informed imitation learning reduction where we utilize the state distribution of the expert to alleviate the global exploration component of the RL subroutine, providing an exponential speedup in theory. In practice, we find that we are able to significantly speed up the prior art on continuous control tasks.},

  abstract     = {Molecules are frequently represented as graphs, but the underlying 3D molecular geometry ultimately determines most molecular properties. Most molecules are not static and at room temperature adopt a wide variety of geometries or conformations. The resulting distribution on geometries is known as the Boltzmann distribution, and many molecular properties are expectations computed under this distribution. Generating accurate samples from the Boltzmann distribution is therefore essential for computing these expectations accurately. Traditional sampling-based methods are computationally expensive, and most recent machine learning-based methods have focused on identifying modes in this distribution rather than generating true samples. Generating such samples requires capturing conformational variability, and it has been widely recognized that the majority of conformational variability in molecules arises from rotatable bonds. In this work, we present VonMisesNet, a new graph neural network that captures conformational variability via a variational approximation of rotatable bond torsion angles as a mixture of von Mises distributions. We demonstrate that VonMisesNet can generate conformations for arbitrary molecules in a way that is both physically accurate with respect to the Boltzmann distribution and orders of magnitude faster than existing sampling methods.},

Existing methods generally suffer from high computational costs when the number of nestings becomes large. Standard Monte Carlo methods typically require at least $O(\varepsilon^{-(2+D)})$ cost to achieve an $\varepsilon$-error estimate, where $D$ is the depth of nesting. In this work, we introduce $\mathsf{READ}$ (Recursive Estimator for Arbitrary Depth), a novel Monte Carlo estimator that leverages the problem's recursive structure and employs randomized multilevel Monte Carlo methods. Under suitable regularity assumptions, $\mathsf{READ}$ achieves the optimal computational cost of $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$ for every fixed depth $D$, representing a significant improvement over existing approaches. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the optimality of our method, and empirical results validate its effectiveness across various applications involving nested expectation estimation.},

We study zero-shot coordination (ZSC) in this task, where an agent collaborates with a new partner, emulating a scenario where a robot collaborates with a new human partner. Prior ZSC approaches struggle to generalize in our complex and visually rich setting, and on further analysis, we find that they fail to generate diverse coordination behaviors at training time. To counter this, we propose Behavior Diversity Play (BDP), a novel ZSC approach that encourages diversity through a discriminability objective. Our results demonstrate that BDP learns adaptive agents that can tackle visual coordination, and zero-shot generalize to new partners in unseen environments, achieving 35% higher success and 32% higher efficiency compared to baselines.},

While some work has been done on optimizing these parameters, it has mostly focused on the one-level setting or special cases such as structured-grid discretizations with regular subdomain construction. In this paper, we propose multigrid graph neural networks (MG-GNN), a novel GNN architecture for learning optimized parameters in two-level DDMs. We train MG-GNN using a new unsupervised loss function, enabling effective training on small problems that yields robust performance on unstructured grids that are orders of magnitude larger than those in the training set. We show that MG-GNN outperforms popular hierarchical graph network architectures for this optimization and that our proposed loss function is critical to achieving this improved performance.},

In addition, we show that even if the smoothness changes depending on each input, Transformers can estimate the importance of features for each input and extract important features dynamically. Then, we proved that Transformers achieve similar convergence rate as in the case of the fixed smoothness.

This work is the first to simultaneously consider the following practical situations: (1) multiple actions are chosen in a round; (2) contexts are observed; and (3) conservative constraints are imposed.

The most widely used approach for preferential BO is Gaussian approximation, which ignores the skewness of the true posterior. Alternatively, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based preferential BO is also proposed.

  abstract     = {Explanation methods are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which change the explanation but not the prediction. This raises security concerns in high-stakes domains where explanations are used for auditing black-box models. We investigate when robust explanations are necessary and what they cost. We prove that the robustness of explanations is determined by the robustness of the model to be explained, meaning we can have robust explanations for free for a robust model. We introduce and prove the existence of a robustness-faithfulness trade-off: contrary to common expectations, an explanation method may become less faithful when it becomes more robust. We are the first to introduce this trade-off and theoretically prove its existence for SmoothGrad. Our theoretical findings are verified by empirical evidence on six state-of-the-art explanation methods and four backbones.},

  abstract     = {Typical machine learning applications always assume the data follows independent and identically distributed (IID) assumptions. In contrast, this assumption is frequently violated in real-world circumstances, leading to the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization problem and a major drop in model robustness. To mitigate this issue, the invariant learning technique is leveraged to distinguish between spurious features and invariant features among all input features and to train the model purely on the basis of the invariant features. Numerous invariant learning strategies imply that the training data should contain domain information. Such information includes the environment index or auxiliary information acquired from prior knowledge. However, acquiring this information is typically impossible in practice. This paper proposes a practical invariant learning algorithm that does not require domain information to tackle the OOD generalization problem.},

We extend online double oracle to extensive-form games and determine its sample complexity. We demonstrate that the sample complexity of extensive-form double oracle can be exponential in the number of information sets, owing to the exponentially decaying stopping threshold of restricted games. To solve this problem, we propose the Periodic Double Oracle method, which has the lowest sample complexity among regret minimization-based double oracle methods, being only polynomial in the number of information sets.},

Despite recent empirical success, such algorithms have an apparent defect: trivial representations (such as constants) minimize the prediction error, yet it is obviously undesirable to converge to such solutions. Our central insight is that careful designs of the optimization dynamics are critical to learning meaningful representations. We identify that a faster paced optimization of the predictor and semi-gradient updates on the representation are crucial to preventing representation collapse. In an idealized setup, we show self-predictive learning dynamics carries out spectral decomposition on the state transition matrix, effectively capturing information of the transition dynamics.

Complementary to prior work, we provide a set of analysis that sheds further light on the representation dynamics under TD-learning. We first show that when the environments are reversible, end-to-end TD-learning strictly decreases the value approximation error over time. Under further assumptions on the environments, we can connect the representation dynamics with spectral decomposition over the transition matrix. This latter finding establishes fitting multiple value functions from randomly generated rewards as a useful auxiliary task for representation learning, as we empirically validate on both tabular and Atari game suites.},

Under this new assumption, we prove partial identifiability of the conditional average treatment effect on the treated group (CATT). Our proposed method estimates CATT through a tree-based causal approach, guided by a novel splitting rule that avoids model misspecification and unnecessary auxiliary parameter estimation. The splitting rule measures both the error of fitting observed data and the violation of conditional parallel trends simultaneously. We also develop an ensemble of multiple trees via gradient boosting to further enhance performance. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

In this study, we propose to use a coupling based on the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) and to initialize the state around a local mode of the target distribution. Because of the propensity of MH to reject proposals, the coupling tends to converge in only one step with a high probability, leading to high efficiency. We find that our method allows DBMs to be trained in an end-to-end fashion without greedy pretraining. We also propose some practical techniques to further improve the performance of DBMs. We empirically demonstrate that our training algorithm enables DBMs to show comparable generative performance to other deep generative models, achieving the FID score of 10.33 for MNIST.},

Recent efforts have sought to address this issue by focal loss to reduce over-confidence, but this approach can also lead to under-confident predictions. While different variants of focal loss have been explored, it is difficult to find a balance between over-confidence and under-confidence. In our work, we propose a new loss function by focusing on dual logits. Our method not only considers the ground truth logit, but also take into account the highest logit ranked after the ground truth logit. By maximizing the gap between these two logits, our proposed dual focal loss can achieve a better balance between over-confidence and under-confidence. We provide theoretical evidence to support our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness through evaluations on multiple models and datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, learning a policy that can generalize to unseen tasks is challenging. In this work, we propose to achieve one-shot task generalization by decoupling plan generation and plan execution. Specifically, our method solves complex long-horizon tasks in three steps: build a paired abstract environment by simplifying geometry and physics, generate abstract trajectories, and solve the original task by an abstract-to-executable trajectory translator. However, this introduces a large domain gap between abstract trajectories and the actual executed trajectories as abstract trajectories lack low-level details and are not aligned frame-to-frame with the executed trajectory. In a manner reminiscent of language translation, our approach leverages a seq-to-seq model to overcome the large domain gap between the abstract and executable trajectories, enabling the low-level policy to follow the abstract trajectory. Experimental results on various unseen long-horizon tasks with different robot embodiments demonstrate the practicability of our methods to achieve one-shot task generalization.},

In this work, we explore unlearning for the regression problem, particularly in deep learning models. Unlearning in classification and simple linear regression has been considerably investigated. However, unlearning in deep regression models largely remains an untouched problem till now. In this work, we introduce deep regression unlearning methods that generalize well and are robust to privacy attacks.},

  abstract     = {Score-based generative modeling, informally referred to as diffusion models, continue to grow in popularity across several important domains and tasks. While they provide high-quality and diverse samples from empirical distributions, important questions remain on the reliability and trustworthiness of these sampling procedures for their responsible use in critical scenarios. Conformal prediction is a modern tool to construct finite-sample, distribution-free uncertainty guarantees for any black-box predictor. In this work, we focus on image-to-image regression tasks and we present a generalization of the Risk-Controlling Prediction Sets (RCPS) procedure, that we term K-RCPS, which allows to (i) provide entrywise calibrated intervals for future samples of any diffusion model, and (ii) control a certain notion of risk with respect to a ground truth image with minimal mean interval length. Differently from existing conformal risk control procedures, ours relies on a novel convex optimization approach that allows for multidimensional risk control while provably minimizing the mean interval length. We illustrate our approach on two real-world image denoising problems: on natural images of faces as well as on computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen, demonstrating state of the art performance.},

We study the private continual summation problem (a.k.a. the counter problem) and show that the concurrent shuffle model allows for significantly improved error compared to a standard (single) shuffle model. Specifically, we give a summation algorithm with error O(n^{1/(2k+1)}) with k concurrent shufflers on a sequence of length n. Furthermore, we prove that this bound is tight for any k, even if the algorithm can choose the sizes of the batches adaptively.},

In this paper, we propose a new generalization measure REF Complexity (RElative Fitting degree between signal and noise), motivated by the intuition that a given model-algorithm pair may generalize well if it fits signal (e.g., true labels) fast while fitting noise (e.g., random labels) slowly.},

Explanation methods (XAI) can provide confidence for decision-making through increased transparency. However, existing XAI methods are not tailored towards models in sensitive domains where one predictor is of special interest, such as a treatment effect in a clinical model, or ethnicity in policy models. We introduce Path-Wise Shapley effects (PWSHAP), a framework for assessing the targeted effect of a binary (e.g. treatment) variable from a complex outcome model. Our approach augments the predictive model with a user-defined directed acyclic graph (DAG). The method then uses the graph alongside on-manifold Shapley values to identify effects along causal pathways whilst maintaining robustness to adversarial attacks. We establish error bounds for the identified path-wise Shapley effects and for Shapley values. We show PWSHAP can perform local bias and mediation analyses with faithfulness to the model. Further, if the targeted variable is randomised we can quantify local effect modification. We demonstrate the resolution, interpretability, and true locality of our approach on examples and a real-world experiment.},

We consider the challenging setting of single-shot adaptation and explore the design of augmentation strategies.

The ELSA estimator is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent and asymptotically normal.

In this work, we examine some practical issues associated with this approach and propose an extension that leverages the orthogonal decomposition of GPs to mitigate these limitations. In particular, we introduce spherical inter-domain features to construct more flexible data-dependent basis functions for both the principal and orthogonal components of the GP approximation and show that incorporating NN activation features under this framework not only alleviates these shortcomings but is more scalable than alternative strategies. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

(2019) in the discounted setting. For this type of exploration, we propose a game-theoretic algorithm that has $\tilde{O}(H^3S^2A/\varepsilon^2)$ sample complexity thus improving the $\varepsilon$-dependence upon existing results, where $S$ is a number of states, $A$ is a number of actions, $H$ is an episode length, and $\varepsilon$ is a desired accuracy. The second type of entropy we study is the trajectory entropy. This objective function is closely related to the entropy-regularized MDPs, and we propose a simple algorithm that has a sample complexity of order $\tilde{O}(\text{poly}(S,A,H)/\varepsilon)$.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in weak supervision (WS) techniques allow to mitigate the enormous cost and effort of human data annotation for supervised machine learning by automating it using simple rule-based labelling functions (LFs). However, LFs need to be carefully designed, often requiring expert domain knowledge and extensive validation for existing WS methods to be effective. To tackle this, we propose the Weak Supervision Variational Auto-Encoder (WS-VAE), a novel framework that combines unsupervised representation learning and weak labelling to reduce the dependence of WS on expert and manual engineering of LFs. Our technique learns from inputs and weak labels jointly to capture the input signals distribution with a latent space. The unsupervised representation component of the WS-VAE regularises the inference of weak labels, while a specifically designed decoder allows the model to learn the relevance of LFs for each input. These unique features lead to considerably improved robustness to the quality of LFs, compared to existing methods. An extensive empirical evaluation on a standard WS benchmark shows that our WS-VAE is competitive to state-of-the-art methods and substantially more robust to LF engineering.},

  abstract     = {We present a fully Bayesian autoencoder model that treats both local latent variables and global decoder parameters in a Bayesian fashion. This approach allows for flexible priors and posterior approximations while keeping the inference costs low. To achieve this, we introduce an amortized MCMC approach by utilizing an implicit stochastic network to learn sampling from the posterior over local latent variables. Furthermore, we extend the model by incorporating a Sparse Gaussian Process prior over the latent space, allowing for a fully Bayesian treatment of inducing points and kernel hyperparameters and leading to improved scalability. Additionally, we enable Deep Gaussian Process priors on the latent space and the handling of missing data. We evaluate our model on a range of experiments focusing on dynamic representation learning and generative modeling, demonstrating the strong performance of our approach in comparison to existing methods that combine Gaussian Processes and autoencoders.},

Challenges emerge with non-stationary training data streams such as continual learning. One powerful approach that has addressed this challenge involves pre-training of large encoders on volumes of readily available data, followed by task-specific tuning. Given a new task, however, updating the weights of these encoders is challenging as a large number of weights needs to be fine-tuned, and as a result, they forget information about the previous tasks. We propose a model architecture to address this issue, building upon a discrete bottleneck containing pairs of separate and learnable key-value codes.},

Surprisingly, we find that simply initializing the weights of self-attention layers so that they look more like their pre-trained counterparts allows us to train vanilla Transformers faster and to higher final accuracies, particularly on vision tasks such as CIFAR-10. Our initialization scheme is closed form, learning-free, and very simple: we set the product of the query and key weights to be approximately the identity, and the product of the value and projection weights to approximately the negative identity. As this mimics the patterns we saw in pre-trained Transformers, we call the technique mimetic initialization.},

We derive consequences for the canonical instances of ℓ₁ regularized sparse models and nuclear norm regularized low-rank models. As a case study, we further investigate the application of low-rank models in the context of collaborative filtering, where we instantiate high-dimensional representers for specific popular classes of models.

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a theoretical framework for continuously improving an agent's behavior via trial and error. However, efficiently learning policies from scratch can be very difficult, particularly for tasks that present exploration challenges. In such settings, it might be desirable to initialize RL with an existing policy, offline data, or demonstrations. However, naively performing such initialization in RL often works poorly, especially for value-based methods. In this paper, we present a meta algorithm that can use offline data, demonstrations, or a pre-existing policy to initialize an RL policy, and is compatible with any RL approach. In particular, we propose Jump-Start Reinforcement Learning (JSRL), an algorithm that employs two policies to solve tasks: a guide-policy, and an exploration-policy. By using the guide-policy to form a curriculum of starting states for the exploration-policy, we are able to efficiently improve performance on a set of simulated robotic tasks. We show via experiments that it is able to significantly outperform existing imitation and reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly in the small-data regime. In addition, we provide an upper bound on the sample complexity of JSRL and show that with the help of a guide-policy, one can improve the sample complexity for non-optimism exploration methods from exponential in horizon to polynomial.},

We give fast algorithms with strong approximation guarantees for maximizing submodular order functions under a variety of constraints and show a nearly tight upper bound on the highest approximation guarantee achievable by algorithms with polynomial query complexity. Applying this new notion to the problem of constrained assortment optimization in fundamental choice models, we obtain new algorithms that are both faster and have stronger approximation guarantees (in some cases, first algorithm with constant factor guarantee). We also show an intriguing connection to the maximization of monotone submodular functions in the streaming model, where we recover best known approximation guarantees as a corollary of our results.},

Under the function approximation setup where the optimal latent state-action Q-function is linear in the state feature, and the optimal Q-function has a gap in actions, we provide a computationally and statistically efficient algorithm for finding the exact optimal policy. The algorithm's computational and statistical complexities scale polynomially with respect to the horizon and the intrinsic dimension of the feature on the observation space. Furthermore, we show both the deterministic latent transitions and gap assumptions are necessary to avoid statistical complexity exponential in horizon or dimension.

  abstract     = {Optimal transport (OT) theory has been used in machine learning to study and characterize maps that can push-forward efficiently a probability measure onto another. Recent works have drawn inspiration from Brenier's theorem, which states that when the ground cost is the squared-Euclidean distance, the "best" map to morph a continuous measure in $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ into another must be the gradient of a convex function. To exploit that result, Makkuva et. al (2020); Korotin et. al (2020) consider maps $T=\nabla f_\theta$, where $f_\theta$ is an input convex neural network (ICNN), as defined by Amos et. al (2017), and fit $\theta$ with SGD using samples. Despite their mathematical elegance, fitting OT maps with ICNNs raises many challenges, due notably to the many constraints imposed on $\theta$; the need to approximate the conjugate of $f_\theta$; or the limitation that they only work for the squared-Euclidean cost. More generally, we question the relevance of using Brenier's result, which only applies to densities, to constrain the architecture of candidate maps fitted on samples. Motivated by these limitations, we propose a radically different approach to estimating OT maps: Given a cost $c$ and a reference measure $\rho$, we introduce a regularizer, the Monge gap $\mathcal{M}^c_{\rho}(T)$ of a map $T$. That gap quantifies how far a map $T$ deviates from the ideal properties we expect from a $c$-OT map. We drop all architecture requirements for $T$ and simply minimize a distance (e.g., the Sinkhorn divergence) between $T \# \mu$ and $\nu$, regularized by $\mathcal{M}^c_{\rho}(T)$. We show this approach significantly outperforms other baselines in practice.},

We use this formulation to prove the first results on statistical estimation of UOT potentials and we leverage the extra convexity to recover super-parametric rates. Interestingly, unlike in the balanced case, we do not require the potentials to be smooth. Then, use variable metric descent to solve the semi-dual problem for which we prove convergence at a 1/k rate for strongly convex potentials and exponential convergence in the balanced case when potentials are also smooth. We emphasize that our convergence results has an interest on its own as it generalizes previous convergence results to non-equivalent metrics.},

An abstraction of the problem can be formulated as a kernel based bandit problem (also known as Bayesian optimisation), where a learner aims at optimising a kernelized function through sequential noisy observations. The existing work predominantly assumes feedback is immediately available; an assumption which fails in many real world situations, including recommendation systems, clinical trials and hyperparameter tuning. We consider a kernel bandit problem under stochastically delayed feedback, and propose an algorithm with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\Gamma_k(T)T}+\mathbb{E}[\tau])$ regret, where $T$ is the number of time steps, $\Gamma_k(T)$ is the maximum information gain of the kernel with $T$ observations, and $\tau$ is the delay random variable.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML) holds great potential for accurately forecasting treatment outcomes over time, which could ultimately enable the adoption of more individualized treatment strategies in many practical applications. However, a significant challenge that has been largely overlooked by the ML literature on this topic is the presence of informative sampling in observational data. When instances are observed irregularly over time, sampling times are typically not random, but rather informative -- depending on the instance's characteristics, past outcomes, and administered treatments. In this work, we formalize informative sampling as a covariate shift problem and show that it can prohibit accurate estimation of treatment outcomes if not properly accounted for. To overcome this challenge, we present a general framework for learning treatment outcomes in the presence of informative sampling using inverse intensity-weighting, and propose a novel method, TESAR-CDE, that instantiates this framework. Using a simulation environment based on a clinical use case, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in learning under informative sampling.},

In this work, we study learning deep discrete representations from the generative viewpoint. Specifically, we endow discrete distributions over sequences of codewords and learn a deterministic decoder that transports the distribution over the sequences of codewords to the data distribution via minimizing a WS distance between them. We develop further theories to connect it with the clustering viewpoint of WS distance, allowing us to have a better and more controllable clustering solution. Finally, we empirically evaluate our method on several well-known benchmarks, where it achieves better qualitative and quantitative performances than the other VQ-VAE variants in terms of the codebook utilization and image reconstruction/generation.},

In the online RL setting, the agent has no prior knowledge of the environment, and must interact with it in order to find an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy. In the offline RL setting, the learner instead has access to a fixed dataset to learn from, but is unable to otherwise interact with the environment, and must obtain the best policy it can from this offline data. Practical scenarios often motivate an intermediate setting: if we have some set of offline data and may also interact with the environment, how can we best use the offline data to minimize the number of online interactions necessary to learn an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy. In this work, we consider this setting, which we call the FineTuneRL setting, for MDPs with linear structure. We characterize the necessary number of online samples needed in this setting given access to some offline dataset, and develop an algorithm, FTPedel, which is provably optimal.},

  abstract     = {State of the art reinforcement learning has enabled training agents on tasks of ever increasing complexity. However, the current paradigm tends to favor training agents from scratch on every new task or on collections of tasks with a view towards generalizing to novel task configurations. The former suffers from poor data efficiency while the latter is difficult when test tasks are out-of-distribution. Agents that can effectively transfer their knowledge about the world pose a potential solution to these issues. In this paper, we investigate transfer learning in the context of model-based agents. Specifically, we aim to understand when exactly environment models have an advantage and why. We find that a model-based approach outperforms controlled model-free baselines for transfer learning. Through ablations, we show that both the policy and dynamics model learnt through exploration matter for successful transfer. We demonstrate our results across three domains which vary in their requirements for transfer: in-distribution procedural (Crafter), in-distribution identical (RoboDesk), and out-of-distribution (Meta-World).},

  abstract     = {As neural networks grow in size and complexity, inference speeds decline. To combat this, one of the most effective compression techniques -- channel pruning -- removes channels from weights. However, for multi-branch segments of a model, channel removal can introduce inference-time memory copies. In turn, these copies increase inference latency -- so much so that the pruned model can be slower than the unpruned model. As a workaround, pruners conventionally constrain certain channels to be pruned together. This fully eliminates memory copies but, as we show, significantly impairs accuracy. We now have a dilemma: Remove constraints but increase latency, or add constraints and impair accuracy. In response, our insight is to reorder channels at export time, reducing latency by reducing memory copies and improving accuracy by removing constraints. By removing constraints from existing pruners, we improve ImageNet accuracy for post-training pruned models by 2.1 points on average and improve inference speeds by up to 2x over a baseline export.},

In this way, the agent can imagine its trajectories and imitate the expert behavior efficiently in task-relevant state space.

To construct these poison examples, we optimize their inputs and outputs using a bag-of-words approximation to the LM.

To address this problem, we first formally characterize a unique challenge in offline meta-RL: transition-reward distribution shift between offline datasets and online adaptation. Our theory finds that out-of-distribution adaptation episodes may lead to unreliable policy evaluation and that online adaptation with in-distribution episodes can ensure adaptation performance guarantee. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose a novel adaptation framework, called In-Distribution online Adaptation with uncertainty Quantification (IDAQ), which generates in-distribution context using a given uncertainty quantification and performs effective task belief inference to address new tasks.},

For regularization, we show that it narrows the generalization gap by precluding models that are inconsistent with the constraints. However, its preference for small violations introduces a bias toward a suboptimal model. For constrained inference, we show that it reduces the population risk by correcting a model's violation, and hence turns the violation into an advantage. The paper also explores the use of two approaches together and propose conditions for constrained inference to compensate for the bias introduced by regularization, aiming to improve both the model complexity and optimal risk.},

  abstract     = {In machine learning applications, it is well known that carefully designed learning rate (step size) schedules can significantly improve the convergence of commonly used first-order optimization algorithms. Therefore how to set step size adaptively becomes an important research question. A popular and effective method is the Polyak step size, which sets step size adaptively for gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent without the need to estimate the smoothness parameter of the objective function. However, there has not been a principled way to generalize the Polyak step size for algorithms with momentum accelerations. This paper presents a general framework to set the learning rate adaptively for first-order optimization methods with momentum, motivated by the derivation of Polyak step size. It is shown that the resulting techniques are much less sensitive to the choice of momentum parameter and may avoid the oscillation of the heavy-ball method on ill-conditioned problems. These adaptive step sizes are further extended to the stochastic settings, which are attractive choices for stochastic gradient descent with momentum. Our methods are demonstrated to be more effective for stochastic gradient methods than prior adaptive step size algorithms in large-scale machine learning tasks.},

First, we improve the regret lower bound to Omega(K^{1/3} T^{2/3}) for algorithms with o(K) memory. Then, we show that the log^{1/3}(T) factor is not necessary by designing algorithms with at most O(log*(K))-arm memory and achieve O(K^{1/3} T^{2/3}) expected regret based on streaming epsilon-best arm algorithms.

However, up until now, most existing works design a source task selection strategy from a purely empirical perspective. Recently, Chen et al. (2022) gave the first active multi-task representation learning (A-MTRL) algorithm which adaptively samples from source tasks and can provably reduce the total sample complexity using the L2-regularized-target-source-relevance parameter nu^2. But their work is theoretically suboptimal in terms of total source sample complexity and is less practical in some real-world scenarios where sparse training source task selection is desired. In this paper, we address both issues. Specifically, we show the strict dominance of the L1-regularized-relevance-based (nu^1-based) strategy by giving a lower bound for the nu^2-based strategy. When nu^1 is unknown, we propose a practical algorithm that uses the LASSO program to estimate nu^1. Our algorithm successfully recovers the optimal result in the known case. In addition to our sample complexity results, we also characterize the potential of our nu^1-based strategy in sample-cost-sensitive settings.},

  abstract     = {Robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs) provide a promising framework for computing reliable policies in the face of model errors. Many successful reinforcement learning algorithms build on variations of policy-gradient methods, but adapting these methods to RMDPs has been challenging. As a result, the applicability of RMDPs to large, practical domains remains limited. This paper proposes a new Double-Loop Robust Policy Gradient (DRPG), the first generic policy gradient method for RMDPs. In contrast with prior robust policy gradient algorithms, DRPG monotonically reduces approximation errors to guarantee convergence to a globally optimal policy in tabular RMDPs. We introduce a novel parametric transition kernel and solve the inner loop robust policy via a gradient-based method.},

Error backpropagation in SNNs is prohibited by the all-or-none nature of spikes. The existing solution circumvents this problem by a relaxation on the gradient calculation using a continuous function with a constant relaxation degree, so-called surrogate gradient learning. Nevertheless, such a solution introduces additional smoothing error on spike firing which leads to the gradients being estimated inaccurately. Thus, how to adaptively adjust the relaxation degree and eliminate smoothing error progressively is crucial. Here, we propose a methodology such that training a prototype neural network will evolve into training an SNN gradually by fusing the learnable relaxation degree into the network with random spike noise.},

  abstract     = {The successes of artificial neural networks (ANNs) are largely attributed to mimicking the human brain structures. Recent advances in neuroscience revealed that neurons interact with each other through various kinds of connectivity patterns to process information, in which the common connectivity patterns are also called circuit motifs. However, many existing ANNs can only model one or two circuit motifs in their architectures, so that their performance may drastically vary among different types of machine learning tasks. In this paper, we propose a new type of neural network inspired by the architectures of neuronal circuits, namely Circuit Neural Network (CircuitNet). In CircuitNet, a group of densely connected neurons, namely circuit motif unit (CMU), form the basic unit of the network, which is capable of modeling universal circuit motifs by adjusting the weights within the CMUs. Compared with traditional feed-forward networks, CircuitNet has the ability to model more types of neuron connections such as feed-back and lateral motifs. Inspired by the locally dense and globally sparse structure of the human brain, several iterations of signal transmission among different CMUs are achieved by sparse connections through the input ports and output ports of different CMUs. Experiments have demonstrated that CircuitNet can outperform popular neural network architectures in function approximation, reinforcement learning, image classification, and time series forecasting tasks.},

To this end, the primary objective of this work is to build a fundamental understanding on "whether and when online learning can be significantly accelerated by a warm-start policy from offline RL?". Specifically, we consider the widely used Actor-Critic (A-C) method with a prior policy. We first quantify the approximation errors in the Actor update and the Critic update, respectively. Next, we cast the Warm-Start A-C algorithm as Newton's method with perturbation, and study the impact of the approximation errors on the finite-time learning performance with inaccurate Actor/Critic updates.},

This is useful in a wide range of real-world applications where collecting pixel-wise labels is not feasible in time or cost. Current approaches to semi-supervised semantic segmentation work by predicting pseudo-labels for each pixel from a class-wise probability distribution output by a model. If this predicted probability distribution is incorrect, however, it leads to poor segmentation results which can have knock-on consequences in safety critical systems, like medical images or self-driving cars. It is, therefore, important to understand what a model does not know, which is mainly achieved by uncertainty quantification. Recently, neural processes (NPs) have been explored in semi-supervised image classification, and they have been a computationally efficient and effective method for uncertainty quantification. In this work, we move one step forward by adapting NPs to semi-supervised semantic segmentation, resulting in a new model called NP-SemiSeg.},

In this work, we design normalizing flows that replace GCN layers, leading to a generative model that models both the class conditional likelihood p(x|y) and the class prior p(y). The resulting neural network, GC-Flow, retains the graph convolution operations while being equipped with a Gaussian mixture representation space. It enjoys two benefits: it not only maintains the predictive power of GCN, but also produces well-separated clusters, due to the structuring of the representation space. We demonstrate these benefits on a variety of benchmark data sets. Moreover, we show that additional parameterization, such as that on the adjacency matrix used for graph convolutions, yields additional improvement in clustering.},

This enables training using standard gradient methods, without any inner approximation or computationally intensive tasks (e.g. projections or barrier terms) for the SDP constraint.

  abstract     = {It has been recognized that the data generated by the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) improves adversarial training. After two years of rapid development in diffusion models, a question naturally arises: can better diffusion models further improve adversarial training? This paper gives an affirmative answer by employing the most recent diffusion model which has higher efficiency (~20 sampling steps) and image quality (lower FID score) compared with DDPM. Our adversarially trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance on RobustBench using only generated data (no external datasets). Under the ℓ∞-norm threat model with ε=8/255, our models achieve 70.69% and 42.67% robust accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively, i.e. improving upon previous state-of-the-art models by +4.58% and +8.03%. Under the ℓ2-norm threat model with ε=128/255, our models achieve 84.86% on CIFAR-10 (+4.44%). These results also beat previous works that use external data. We also provide compelling results on the SVHN and TinyImageNet datasets.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning-driven human behavior analysis is gaining attention in behavioral/mental healthcare, due to its potential to identify behavioral patterns that cannot be recognized by traditional assessments. Real-life applications, such as digital behavioral biomarker identification, often require the discovery of complex spatiotemporal patterns in multimodal data, which is largely under-explored. To fill this gap, we propose a novel model that integrates uniquely designed Deep Temporal Sets (DTS) with Evidential Reinforced Attentions (ERA). DTS captures complex temporal relationships in the input and generates a set-based representation, while ERA captures the policy network's uncertainty and conducts evidence-aware exploration to locate attentive regions in behavioral data. Using child-computer interaction data as a testing platform, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DTS-ERA in differentiating children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and typically developing children. Comparisons with baseline methods show that our model achieves superior performance and has the potential to provide objective, quantitative, and precise analysis of complex human behaviors.},

Despite the non-convex and discrete nature of the maximum likelihood estimation problem, we develop a simple yet efficient iterative method, called the projected tensor power method, to tackle it. As long as the initialization satisfies a partial recovery condition in the logarithmic degree regime of the problem, we show that our proposed method can exactly recover the hidden community structure down to the information-theoretic limit with high probability.},

Despite notable performance improvements, concerns have been raised that such a growing model size will run out of data in the near future. As manifested in the neural scaling law, modern learning backbones are not data-efficient. To maintain the utility of the model capacity, training data should be increased proportionally. In this paper, we study the neural scaling law under the previously overlooked data scarcity regime, focusing on the more challenging situation where we need to train a gigantic model with a disproportionately limited supply of available training data. We find that the existing power laws underestimate the data inefficiency of large transformers. Their performance will drop significantly if the training set is insufficient. Fortunately, we discover another blessing - such a data-inefficient scaling law can be restored through a model reusing approach that warm-starts the training of a large model by initializing it using smaller models. Our empirical study shows that model reusing can effectively reproduce the power law under the data scarcity regime. When progressively applying model reusing to expand the model size, we also observe consistent performance improvement in large transformers.},

However, in practical scenarios, user preferences are often simultaneously influenced by multiple environments, such as different seasons or different social groups, which leads to challenges for recommender systems. We consider a scenario where multiple environments affect users simultaneously, making the disentanglement of environment-specific representations essential. In this paper, we propose a Curriculum Co-disentangled Representation Learning (CCRL) approach that can disentangle environment-invariant and environment-specific representations for social recommendation. The approach introduces curriculum learning by progressively reducing the sparsity of training data, which helps the model learn better disentangled representations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of recommendation accuracy and representation quality.},

However, in the presence of latent confounders, only a part of causal relations can be identified from observational data, characterized by a partial ancestral graph (PAG), where some causal relations are indeterminate. In such cases, the causal effect is often unidentifiable, as there could be super-exponential number of potential causal graphs consistent with the identified PAG but associated with different causal effects. In this paper, we target set determination within a PAG, i.e., determining the set of possible causal effects of a specified variable X on another variable Y via covariate adjustment. We develop the first set determination method that does not require enumerating any causal graphs. The research tackles the challenge of determining the set of all possible causal effects, where a causal effect is considered possible if there exists a DAG, consistent with observational data, that yields this effect. Although such a set is less informative than identifying a unique causal effect, it still provides valuable information and, more importantly, does not require prior structural knowledge or experimental data, making it broadly applicable in practice.},

Here, we propose InfoDiffusion, an algorithm that augments diffusion models with low-dimensional latent variables that capture high-level factors of variation in the data. InfoDiffusion relies on a learning objective regularized with the mutual information between observed and hidden variables, which improves latent space quality and prevents the latents from being ignored by expressive diffusion-based decoders. Empirically, we find that InfoDiffusion learns disentangled and human-interpretable latent representations that are competitive with state-of-the-art generative and contrastive methods, while retaining the high sample quality of diffusion models. Our method enables manipulating the attributes of generated images and has the potential to assist tasks that require exploring a learned latent space to generate quality samples, e.g., generative design.},

Furthermore, it facilitates decentralized GPU devices to expedite various trajectory selection strategies, circumventing computational bottlenecks. GEAR is equipped with GPU kernels capable of collecting trajectories using zero-copy access to host memory, along with remote-directed-memory access over InfiniBand, improving communication efficiency.

The optimality of various RL algorithms relies on the stationarity assumption, which requires time-invariant state transition and reward functions. However, deviations from stationarity over extended periods often occur in real-world applications like robotics control, health care and digital marketing, resulting in suboptimal policies learned under stationary assumptions. In this paper, we propose a model-based doubly robust procedure for testing the stationarity assumption and detecting change points in offline RL settings with certain degree of homogeneity. Our proposed testing procedure is robust to model misspecifications and can effectively control type-I error while achieving high statistical power, especially in high-dimensional settings.},

Previous works learn a dynamics model that fits under the empirical state-action visitation distribution for all historical policies, i.e., the sample replay buffer. However, in this paper, we observe that fitting the dynamics model under the distribution for all historical policies does not necessarily benefit model prediction for the current policy since the policy in use is constantly evolving over time. The evolving policy during training will cause state-action visitation distribution shifts. We theoretically analyze how this distribution shift over historical policies affects the model learning and model rollouts. We then propose a novel dynamics model learning method, named Policy-adapted Dynamics Model Learning (PDML). PDML dynamically adjusts the historical policy mixture distribution to ensure the learned model can continually adapt to the state-action visitation distribution of the evolving policy. Experiments on a range of continuous control environments in MuJoCo show that PDML achieves significant improvement in sample efficiency and higher asymptotic performance combined with the state-of-the-art model-based RL methods.},

In this work, we study the problem of learning in repeated first-price auctions with budgets. We design a dual-based algorithm that can achieve a near-optimal $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with full information feedback where the maximum competing bid is always revealed after each auction. We further consider the setting with one-sided information feedback where only the winning bid is revealed after each auction. We show that our modified algorithm can still achieve an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with mild assumptions on the bidder's value distribution. Finally, we complement the theoretical results with numerical experiments to confirm the effectiveness of our budget management policy.},

We consider a distributed learning setting where agents partially cooperate on an agent network, while during learning, the data samples drawn depend on the prediction models of the agent itself and neighboring agents on a population network. The dynamics of Multi-PP games is hence affected by the interplay between both networks. This paper concentrates on this Multi-PP game with the following contributions. Firstly, we analyze sufficient conditions for the existence of the performative stable equilibrium (PSE) and Nash equilibrium (NE) of the Multi-PP games. Secondly, we analyze the changes to the equilibrium induced by perturbed data distributions, and derive the closed-form solutions where the network topologies are explicit. Our results connect the existence of PSE/NE with strengths of agents' cooperation, and the changes of equilibrium solutions across agents with their node centrality, etc. Lastly, we show that a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based distributed learning procedure finds the PSE under the said sufficient condition. Numerical illustrations on the network effects in Multi-PP games corroborate our findings.},

  abstract     = {In Reinforcement Learning (RL), Laplacian Representation (LapRep) is a task-agnostic state representation that encodes the geometry of the environment. A desirable property of LapRep stated in prior works is that the Euclidean distance in the LapRep space roughly reflects the reachability between states, which motivates the usage of this distance for reward shaping. However, we find that LapRep does not necessarily have this property in general: two states having small distance under LapRep can actually be far away in the environment. Such mismatch would impede the learning process in reward shaping. To fix this issue, we introduce a Reachability-Aware Laplacian Representation (RA-LapRep), by properly scaling each dimension of LapRep. Despite the simplicity, we demonstrate that RA-LapRep can better capture the inter-state reachability as compared to LapRep, through both theoretical explanations and experimental results. Additionally, we show that this improvement yields a significant boost in reward shaping performance and also benefits bottleneck state discovery.},

  abstract     = {Model-free reinforcement learning methods based on a phasic policy gradient (PPG) framework have shown impressive improvements in sample efficiency and zero-shot generalization on the challenging Procgen benchmark. In PPG, two design choices were believed to be the key contributing factors to its superior performance over PPO: the high level of value sample reuse and the low frequency of feature distillation. However, through extensive empirical study, we unveil that policy regularization and data diversity are what actually matters. In particular, we find we can achieve the same level of performance with low value sample reuse and frequent feature distillation, as long as the policy regularization strength and data diversity are preserved. Additionally, we can maintain the high performance of PPG while reducing the computational cost to a similar level as PPO. Our comprehensive study covers all 16 Procgen games in both sample efficiency and generalization setups.},

We further theoretically characterize the convergence property of the Sinkhorn algorithm for multiple marginals. In contrast to the sequential decision e.g. reinforcement learning-based solvers, we showcase our technique in solving constrained (specifically satisfiability) problems by one-shot neural networks, including i) a neural routing solver learned without supervision of optimal solutions; ii) a partial graph matching network handling graphs with unmatchable outliers on both sides; iii) a predictive network for financial portfolios with continuous constraints. To our knowledge, there exists no one-shot neural solver for these scenarios when they are formulated as satisfiability problems.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneity and comorbidity are two interwoven challenges associated with various healthcare problems that greatly hampered research on developing effective treatment and understanding of the underlying neurobiological mechanism. Very few studies have been conducted to investigate heterogeneous causal effects (HCEs) in graphical contexts due to the lack of statistical methods. To characterize this heterogeneity, we first conceptualize heterogeneous causal graphs (HCGs) by generalizing the causal graphical model with confounder-based interactions and multiple mediators. Such confounders with an interaction with the treatment are known as moderators. This allows us to flexibly produce HCGs given different moderators and explicitly characterize HCEs from the treatment or potential mediators on the outcome. An interactive structural learning is developed to estimate the complex HCGs and HCEs with confidence intervals provided. Our method is empirically justified by extensive simulations and its practical usefulness is illustrated by exploring causality among psychiatric disorders for trauma survivors.},

This regularization-free approach eliminates the need for hyperparameter tuning required in the original DTAN framework. The method facilitates joint alignment and averaging of time-series ensembles in an unsupervised or weakly-supervised manner, providing a learning-based solution for time-series joint alignment that generalizes well to previously-unseen signals.},

This motivates the study on classification from aggregate observations (CFAO), where the supervision is provided to groups of instances, instead of individual instances. CFAO is a generalized learning framework that contains various learning problems, such as multiple-instance learning and learning from label proportions. The goal of this paper is to present a novel universal method of CFAO, which holds an unbiased estimator of the classification risk for arbitrary losses -- previous research failed to achieve this goal. Practically, our method works by weighing the importance of each instance and each label in the group, which provides purified supervision for the classifier to learn. The method is theoretically grounded with guaranteed risk consistency and compatibility with arbitrary loss functions.},

However, even fine-tuning the PLMs and doing inference are expensive, especially on edge devices with low computing power. Some general approaches (e.g. quantization and distillation) have been widely studied to reduce the compute/memory of PLM fine-tuning, while very few one-shot compression techniques are explored. In this paper, we investigate the neural tangent kernel (NTK)--which reveals the gradient descent dynamics of neural networks--of the multilayer perceptrons (MLP) modules in a PLM and propose to coin a lightweight PLM through NTK-approximating MLP fusion. To achieve this, we reconsider the MLP as a bundle of sub-MLPs, and cluster them into a given number of centroids, which can then be restored as a compressed MLP and surprisingly shown to well approximate the NTK of the original PLM. Extensive experiments of PLM fine-tuning on both natural language understanding (NLU) and generation (NLG) tasks are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method MLP fusion.},

However, mainstream Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) often favors random graph augmentations, by relying on random node dropout or edge perturbation on graphs. Random augmentations may inevitably lead to semantic information corruption during the training, and force the network to mistakenly focus on semantically irrelevant environmental background structures. To address these limitations and to improve generalization, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework for GCL, which can adaptively screen the semantic-related substructure in graphs by capitalizing on the proposed gradient-based Graph Contrastive Saliency (GCS). The goal is to identify the most semantically discriminative structures of a graph via contrastive learning, such that we can generate semantically meaningful augmentations by leveraging on saliency. Empirical evidence on 16 benchmark datasets demonstrates the exclusive merits of the GCS-based framework. We also provide rigorous theoretical justification for GCS's robustness properties.},

However, in many real-world sequential decision-making tasks, the observation data could be noisy or incomplete due to the intrinsic low quality of the sensors or unexpected malfunctions; that is, the agent's perceptions are rarely perfect. The current POMDP RL methods, such as particle-based and Gaussian-based, can only provide a probability estimate of hidden states rather than certain belief regions, which may lead to inefficient and even wrong decision-making. This paper proposes a novel algorithm called Set-membership Belief state-based Reinforcement Learning (SBRL), which consists of two parts: a Set-membership Belief state learning Model (SBM) for learning bounded belief state sets and an RL controller for making decisions based on SBM. We prove that our belief estimation method can provide a series of belief state sets that always contain the true states under the unknown-but-bounded (UBB) noise. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on a collection of benchmark tasks, and the results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

Cross Entropy (CE) loss has been shown to be not robust to noisy labels due to its unboundedness. To alleviate this issue, existing works typically design specialized robust losses with the symmetric condition, which usually lead to the underfitting issue. In this work, we aim to induce a loss bound at the logit level, thus universally enhancing the noise robustiveness of existing losses. Specifically, we propose logit clipping (LogitClip), which clamps the norm of the logit vector to ensure that it is upper bounded by a constant. In this manner, CE loss equipped with our LogitClip method is effectively bounded, mitigating the overfitting to examples with noisy labels. We theoretically analyze LogitClip and demonstrate its noise-tolerant ability. Extensive experiments show that LogitClip not only significantly improves the noise robustness of CE loss, but also broadly enhances the generalization performance of popular robust losses.},

Motivated by this, we try to investigate the connectivity in CIL and find that the high-loss ridge exists along the linear connection between two adjacent continual minima. To dodge the ridge, we propose parameter-saving OPtimizing Connectivity (OPC) based on Fourier series and gradient projection for finding the low-loss path between minima. The optimized path provides infinite low-loss solutions. We further propose EOPC to ensemble points within a local bent cylinder to improve performance on learned tasks.

Our framework extends CLIP with minimal modifications to model spatial-temporal relationships in videos, making it a specialized video classifier, while striving for generalization. We formally show that training an Open-VCLIP is equivalent to continual learning with zero historical data. To address this problem, we propose Interpolated Weight Optimization, which utilizes the benefit of weight interpolation in both training and test time.

  abstract     = {Composition is a key feature of differential privacy. Well-known advanced composition theorems allow one to query a private database quadratically more times than basic privacy composition would permit. However, these results require that the privacy parameters of all algorithms be fixed before interacting with the data. To address this, Rogers et al. introduced fully adaptive composition, wherein both algorithms and their privacy parameters can be selected adaptively. They defined two probabilistic objects to measure privacy in adaptive composition: privacy filters, which provide differential privacy guarantees for composed interactions, and privacy odometers, time-uniform bounds on privacy loss. There are substantial gaps between advanced composition and existing filters and odometers. First, existing filters place stronger assumptions on the algorithms being composed. Second, these odometers and filters suffer from large constants, making them impractical. We construct filters that match the rates of advanced composition, including constants, despite allowing for adaptively chosen privacy parameters. En route we also derive a privacy filter for approximate zCDP. We also construct several general families of odometers. These odometers match the tightness of advanced composition at an arbitrary, preselected point in time, or at all points in time simultaneously, up to a doubly-logarithmic factor. We obtain our results by leveraging advances in martingale concentration. In sum, we show that fully adaptive privacy is obtainable at almost no loss.},

However, existing constraints on MBC architectures lead to models with limited expressive power. Additionally, prior work has not addressed how to deal with large sets during training when the full set gradient is required. To address these issues, we propose a Universally MBC (UMBC) class of set functions which can be used in conjunction with arbitrary non-MBC components while still satisfying MBC, enabling a wider range of function classes to be used in MBC settings. Furthermore, we propose an efficient MBC training algorithm which gives an unbiased approximation of the full set gradient and has a constant memory overhead for any set size for both train- and test-time. We conduct extensive experiments including image completion, text classification, unsupervised clustering, and cancer detection on high-resolution images to verify the efficiency and efficacy of our scalable set encoding framework.

In particular, sensitivity sampling is an intensely studied technique which provides provable guarantees on the quality of approximation, while reducing the number of examples to the product of the VC dimension $d$ and the total sensitivity $\mathfrak{S}$ in remarkably general settings. However, guarantees going beyond this general bound of $\mathfrak{S}d$ are known in perhaps only one setting, for $\ell_2$ subspace embeddings, despite intense study of sensitivity sampling in prior work. In this work, we show the first bounds for sensitivity sampling for $\ell_p$ subspace embeddings for $p \neq 2$ that improve over the general $\mathfrak{S}d$ bound, achieving a bound of roughly $\mathfrak{S}^{2/p}$ for $1 \leq p < 2$ and $\mathfrak{S}^{2-2/p}$ for $2 < p < \infty$. For $1 \leq p < 2$, we show that this bound is tight, in the sense that there exist matrices for which $\mathfrak{S}^{2/p}$ samples is necessary. Furthermore, our techniques yield further new results in the study of sampling algorithms, showing that the root leverage score sampling algorithm achieves a bound of roughly $d$ for $1 \leq p < 2$, and that a combination of leverage score and sensitivity sampling achieves an improved bound of roughly $d^{2/p}\mathfrak{S}^{2-4/p}$ for $2 < p < \infty$. Our sensitivity sampling results yield the best known sample complexity for a wide class of structured matrices that have small $\ell_p$ sensitivity.},

Compared with the previous studies for private reinforcement learning that typically assume rewards are sampled from some bounded or sub-Gaussian distributions to ensure {DP}, we consider the setting where reward distributions have only finite $(1+v)$-th moments with some $v\in(0,1]$. By resorting to robust mean estimators for rewards, we first propose two frameworks for heavy-tailed {MDP}s, i.e., one is for value iteration and another is for policy optimization. Under each framework, we consider both joint differential privacy ({JDP}) and local differential privacy ({LDP}) models. Based on our frameworks, we provide regret upper bounds for both {JDP} and {LDP} cases, and show that the moment of distributions and privacy budget have significant impact on regrets. Finally, we establish a lower bound of regret minimization for heavy-tailed {MDP}s in {JDP} model by reducing it to the instance-independent lower bound of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits in {DP} model. We also show the lower bound for the problem in {LDP} by adopting some private minimax methods. Our results reveal that there are fundamental differences between the problem of private {RL} with sub-Gaussian and that with heavy-tailed rewards.},

The lack of inactive clients' updates in partial client participation makes it more likely for the model aggregation to deviate from the aggregation based on full client participation. Training with large batches on individual clients is proposed to address data heterogeneity in general, but their effectiveness under partial client participation is not clear. Motivated by these challenges, we propose to develop a novel federated learning framework, referred to as {F}ed{AMD}, for partial client participation. The core idea is anchor sampling, which separates partial participants into anchor and miner groups. Each client in the anchor group aims at the local bullseye with the gradient computation using a large batch. Meanwhile, each client in the miner group aims at the global target with the gradient computation using a small batch. Theoretical analysis shows that {F}ed{AMD} can achieve a similar convergence rate as full client participation when the anchor-miner partition is appropriate.},

In this paper, based on the theory of graph information bottleneck, we deduce the definition of this anchor view; put differently, the anchor view with essential information of input graph is supposed to have the minimal structural uncertainty. Furthermore, guided by structural entropy, we implement the anchor view, termed {SEGA}, for graph contrastive learning.

In response, many explainability methods make no use of counterfactual texts, assuming they will be unavailable. In this paper, we show that robust causal explainability methods can be created using approximate counterfactuals, which can be written by humans to approximate a specific counterfactual or simply sampled using metadata-guided heuristics. The core of our proposal is the Causal Proxy Model ({CPM}). A {CPM} explains a black-box model $\mathcal{N}$ because it is trained to have the same actual input/output behavior as $\mathcal{N}$ while creating neural representations that can be intervened upon to simulate the counterfactual input/output behavior of $\mathcal{N}$.},

  abstract     = {Topic models have been prevalent for decades with various applications. However, existing topic models commonly suffer from the notorious topic collapsing: discovered topics semantically collapse towards each other, leading to highly repetitive topics, insufficient topic discovery, and damaged model interpretability. In this paper, we propose a new neural topic model, Embedding Clustering Regularization Topic Model ({ECRTM}). Besides the existing reconstruction error, we propose a novel Embedding Clustering Regularization ({ECR}), which forces each topic embedding to be the center of a separately aggregated word embedding cluster in the semantic space. This enables each produced topic to contain distinct word semantics, which alleviates topic collapsing. Regularized by {ECR}, our {ECRTM} generates diverse and coherent topics together with high-quality topic distributions of documents.},

Recent works use a mixture model for meta-knowledge to deal with the heterogeneity. However, these methods suffer from parameter inefficiency caused by two reasons: (1) the underlying assumption of mutual exclusiveness among mixture components hinders sharing meta-knowledge across heterogeneous tasks. (2) they only allow increasing mixture components and cannot adaptively filter out redundant components. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Compositional Continual Meta-Learning ({ACML}) algorithm, which employs a compositional premise to associate a task with a subset of mixture components, allowing meta-knowledge sharing among heterogeneous tasks. Furthermore, we design an adaptive component selection mechanism to expand or merge mixture components according to task relatedness, enabling the meta-learner to determine whether to learn new meta-knowledge or exploit existing one adaptively.},

Although this problem has been well understood when the samples are drawn from an isoperimetric distribution, much remains unknown concerning its performance under generic or even the worst-case distributions. We prove a Lipschitzness lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{n/p})$ of the interpolating neural network with $p$ parameters on arbitrary data distributions.

A burgeoning paradigm is learning neural operators to approximate the input-output mappings of PDEs. While previous deep models have explored the multiscale architectures and various operator designs, they are limited to learning the operators as a whole in the coordinate space. In real physical science problems, PDEs are complex coupled equations with numerical solvers relying on discretization into high-dimensional coordinate space, which cannot be precisely approximated by a single operator nor efficiently learned due to the curse of dimensionality. We present Latent Spectral Models (LSM) toward an efficient and precise solver for high-dimensional PDEs. Going beyond the coordinate space, LSM enables an attention-based hierarchical projection network to reduce the high-dimensional data into a compact latent space in linear time. Inspired by classical spectral methods in numerical analysis, we design a neural spectral block to solve PDEs in the latent space that approximates complex input-output mappings via learning multiple basis operators, enjoying nice theoretical guarantees for convergence and approximation. Experimentally, LSM achieves consistent state-of-the-art and yields a relative gain of 11.5% averaged on seven benchmarks covering both solid and fluid physics and performs favorable efficiency and transferability.},

  abstract     = {Recently, test-time adaptation (TTA) has been proposed as a promising solution for addressing distribution shifts. It allows a base model to adapt to an unforseen distribution during inference by leveraging the information from the batch of (unlabeled) test data. However, we uncover a novel security vulnerability of TTA based on the insight that predictions on benign samples can be impacted by malicious samples in the same batch. To exploit this vulnerability, we propose Distribution Invading Attack (DIA), which injects a small fraction of malicious data into the test batch. DIA causes models using TTA to misclassify benign and unperturbed test data, providing an entirely new capability for adversaries that is infeasible in canonical machine learning pipelines. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the high effectiveness of our attack on multiple benchmarks across six TTA methods. In response, we investigate two countermeasures to robustify the existing insecure TTA implementations, following the principle of "security by design". Together, we hope our findings can make the community aware of the utility-security tradeoffs in deploying TTA and provide valuable insights for developing robust TTA approaches.},

To improve the estimation accuracy of HTE for underrepresented populations, we propose a novel Stable CounterFactual Regression (StableCFR) to smooth the population distribution and upsample the underrepresented subpopulations, while balancing confounders between treatment and control groups. Specifically, StableCFR upsamples the underrepresented data using uniform sampling, where each disjoint subpopulation is weighted proportional to the Lebesgue measure of its support.},

We quantify knowledge reliability in GNNs by measuring the invariance of their information entropy to noise perturbations, observing that different knowledge points show different distillation speeds temporally and are differentially distributed in the graph spatially. To achieve reliable distillation, we propose Knowledge-inspired Reliable Distillation (KRD), which models the probability of each node being an informative and reliable knowledge point, sampling additional reliable knowledge points for training student MLPs. Extensive experiments show that KRD improves over vanilla MLPs by 12.62% and outperforms corresponding teacher GNNs by 2.16% averaged over 7 datasets and 3 GNN architectures.},

Particularly, parametric explainers prevail in existing approaches because of their more robust capability to decipher the black-box (i.e., target GNNs). In this paper, based on the observation that graphs typically share some common motif patterns, we propose a novel non-parametric subgraph matching framework, dubbed MatchExplainer, to explore explanatory subgraphs. It couples the target graph with other counterpart instances and identifies the most crucial joint substructure by minimizing the node corresponding-based distance. Moreover, we note that present graph sampling or node-dropping methods usually suffer from the false positive sampling problem. To alleviate this issue, we designed a new augmentation paradigm named MatchDrop. It takes advantage of MatchExplainer to fix the most informative portion of the graph and merely operates graph augmentations on the rest less informative part. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the effectiveness of MatchExplainer by outperforming all state-of-the-art parametric baselines with significant margins.},

Toward solving it, we characterize the generalization properties of various learning algorithms based on the corresponding surrogate losses w.r.t. Macro-AUC. We theoretically identify a critical factor of the dataset affecting the generalization bounds: the label-wise class imbalance. Our results on the imbalance-aware error bounds show that the widely-used univariate loss-based algorithm is more sensitive to the label-wise class imbalance than the proposed pairwise and reweighted loss-based ones, which probably implies its worse performance. Moreover, empirical results on various datasets corroborate our theory findings. To establish it, technically, we propose a new (and more general) McDiarmid-type concentration inequality, which may be of independent interest.},

For example, the same MTM network can be used as a forward dynamics model, inverse dynamics model, or even an offline RL agent. Through extensive experiments in several continuous control tasks, we show that the same MTM network -- i.e. same weights -- can match or outperform specialized networks trained for the aforementioned capabilities.

Multi-fidelity active learning aims to learn a direct mapping from input parameters to simulation outputs at the highest fidelity by actively acquiring data from multiple fidelity levels. However, existing approaches based on Gaussian processes are hardly scalable to high-dimensional data. Deep learning-based methods often impose a hierarchical structure in hidden representations, which only supports passing information from low-fidelity to high-fidelity. These approaches can lead to the undesirable propagation of errors from low-fidelity representations to high-fidelity ones. We propose a novel framework called Disentangled Multi-fidelity Deep Bayesian Active Learning (D-MFDAL), which learns the surrogate models conditioned on the distribution of functions at multiple fidelities. On benchmark tasks of learning deep surrogates of partial differential equations including heat equation, Poisson's equation and fluid simulations, our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art in prediction accuracy and sample efficiency.},

We start by revising existing stability analyses of SGD, showing how the Frobenius norm and trace of Hessian relate to different notions of stability. Notably, if a global minimum is linearly stable for SGD, then the trace of Hessian must be less than or equal to $2/\eta$, where $\eta$ denotes the learning rate. By contrast, for gradient descent (GD), the stability imposes a similar constraint but only on the largest eigenvalue of Hessian. We then turn to analyze the generalization properties of these stable minima, focusing specifically on two-layer ReLU networks and diagonal linear networks. Notably, we establish the equivalence between these metrics of sharpness and certain parameter norms for the two models, which allows us to show that the stable minima of SGD provably generalize well. By contrast, the stability-induced regularization of GD is provably too weak to ensure satisfactory generalization. This discrepancy provides an explanation of why SGD often generalizes better than GD. Note that the learning rate (LR) plays a pivotal role in the strength of stability-induced regularization. As the LR increases, the regularization effect becomes more pronounced, elucidating why SGD with a larger LR consistently demonstrates superior generalization capabilities. Additionally, numerical experiments are provided to support our theoretical findings.},

A functional is a map from the space of features to distributions over a set of labels, and is often assumed to belong to a known class of hypotheses. Features are generated by a general random process and labels are sampled independently from feature-dependent distributions. In privacy sensitive applications, labels are passed through a noisy kernel. We consider online learning, where at each time step, a predictor attempts to predict the actual (label) distribution given only the features and noisy labels in prior steps. The performance of the predictor is measured by the expected KL-risk that compares the predicted distributions to the underlying truth. We show that the minimax expected KL-risk is of order $\Theta(\sqrt{T \log|F|})$ for finite hypothesis class $F$ and any non-trivial noise level.},

We study the problem of quantum architecture search ({QAS}) for {VQA} to automatically design parameterized quantum circuits ({PQC}). We devise a differentiable searching algorithm based on {Gumbel-Softmax} in contrast to peer methods that often require numerous circuit sampling and evaluation.

Mitigating spurious correlations is crucial in building trustworthy models. However, the existing works lack transparency to offer insights into the mitigation process. In this work, we propose an interpretable framework, Discover and Cure ({DISC}), to tackle the issue. With human-interpretable concepts, {DISC} iteratively 1) discovers unstable concepts across different environments as spurious attributes, then 2) intervenes on the training data using the discovered concepts to reduce spurious correlation.

On the other hand, we provide some negative results for stochastic gradient descent ({SGD}) for {ReLU} regression with symmetric Bernoulli data: if the model is well-specified, the excess risk of {SGD} is provably no better than that of {GLM-tron} ignoring constant factors, for each problem instance; and in the noiseless case, {GLM-tron} can achieve a small risk while {SGD} unavoidably suffers from a constant risk in expectation.},

The approach reduces epistemic uncertainty through guided interaction (introducing prior knowledge) and aleatoric uncertainty through modeling data distribution (introducing statistics for both data and possible noise). The proposed matting framework relieves the requirement for users to determine interaction areas by using simple and efficient labeling.},

In this work, we propose the adaptability hypothesis to understand when and why a backdoor attack works for general learning models, including deep neural networks, based on the theoretical investigation of classical kernel-based learning models. The adaptability hypothesis postulates that for an effective attack, the effect of incorporating a new dataset on the predictions of the original data points will be small, provided that the original data points are distant from the new dataset. Experiments on benchmark image datasets and state-of-the-art backdoor attacks for deep neural networks are conducted to corroborate the hypothesis.},

Understanding such tradeoffs, therefore, underlies the design of fair algorithms. To this end, this paper provides a complete characterization of the inherent tradeoff of demographic parity on classification problems, under the most general multi-group, multi-class, and noisy setting. Specifically, we show that the minimum error rate achievable by randomized and attribute-aware fair classifiers is given by the optimal value of a Wasserstein-barycenter problem. On the practical side, our findings lead to a simple post-processing algorithm that derives fair classifiers from score functions, which yields the optimal fair classifier when the score is Bayes optimal. We provide suboptimality analysis and sample complexity for our algorithm, and demonstrate its effectiveness on benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Backdoor (Trojan) attack is a common threat to deep neural networks, where samples from one or more source classes embedded with a backdoor trigger will be misclassified to adversarial target classes. Existing methods for detecting whether a classifier is backdoor attacked are mostly designed for attacks with a single adversarial target (e.g., all-to-one attack). To the best of our knowledge, without supervision, no existing methods can effectively address the more general X2X attack with an arbitrary number of source classes, each paired with an arbitrary target class. In this paper, we propose UMD, the first Unsupervised Model Detection method that effectively detects X2X backdoor attacks via a joint inference of the adversarial (source, target) class pairs. In particular, we first define a novel transferability statistic to measure and select a subset of putative backdoor class pairs based on a proposed clustering approach. Then, these selected class pairs are jointly assessed based on an aggregation of their reverse-engineered trigger size for detection inference, using a robust and unsupervised anomaly detector we proposed. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and Imagenette dataset, and show that our unsupervised UMD outperforms SOTA detectors (even with supervision) by 17%, 4%, and 8%, respectively, in terms of the detection accuracy against diverse X2X attacks. We also show the strong detection performance of UMD against several strong adaptive attacks.},

The biggest challenge lies in computing the gradient of the upper-level objective function (i.e., hypergradient) in the federated setting due to the nonlinear and distributed construction of a series of global Hessian matrices. In this paper, we propose a novel communication-efficient federated hypergradient estimator via aggregated iterative differentiation (AggITD). AggITD is simple to implement and significantly reduces the communication cost by conducting the federated hypergradient estimation and the lower-level optimization simultaneously. We show that the proposed AggITD-based algorithm achieves the same sample complexity as existing approximate implicit differentiation (AID)-based approaches with much fewer communication rounds in the presence of data heterogeneity. Our results also shed light on the great advantage of ITD over AID in the federated/distributed hypergradient estimation. This differs from the comparison in the non-distributed bilevel optimization, where ITD is less efficient than AID. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the great effectiveness and communication efficiency of the proposed method.},

However, it is notorious that GAN-based SR models will inevitably produce unpleasant and undesirable artifacts, especially in practical scenarios. Previous works typically suppress artifacts with an extra loss penalty in the training phase. They only work for in-distribution artifact types generated during training. When applied in real-world scenarios, we observe that those improved methods still generate obviously annoying artifacts during inference. In this paper, we analyze the cause and characteristics of the GAN artifacts produced in unseen test data without ground-truths. We then develop a novel method, namely, DeSRA, to Detect and then Delete those SR Artifacts in practice. Specifically, we propose to measure a relative local variance distance from MSE-SR results and GAN-SR results, and locate the problematic areas based on the above distance and semantic-aware thresholds. After detecting the artifact regions, we develop a finetune procedure to improve GAN-based SR models with a few samples, so that they can deal with similar types of artifacts in more unseen real data. Equipped with our DeSRA, we can successfully eliminate artifacts from inference and improve the ability of SR models to be applied in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {We study semiparametrically efficient estimation in off-policy evaluation (OPE) where the underlying Markov decision process (MDP) is linear with a known feature map. We characterize the variance lower bound for regular estimators in the linear MDP setting and propose an efficient estimator whose variance achieves that lower bound. Consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimator are established under mild conditions, which merely requires the only infinite-dimensional nuisance parameter to be estimated at a n^{-1/4} convergence rate. We also construct an asymptotically valid confidence interval for statistical inference and conduct simulation studies to validate our results. To our knowledge, this is the first work that concerns efficient estimation in the presence of a known structure of MDPs in the OPE literature.},

  abstract     = {Dynamics prediction, which is the problem of predicting future states of scene objects based on current and prior states, is drawing increasing attention as an instance of learning physics. To solve this problem, Region Proposal Convolutional Interaction Network (RPCIN), a vision-based model, was proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance in long-term prediction. RPCIN only takes raw images and simple object descriptions, such as the bounding box and segmentation mask of each object, as input. However, despite its success, the model's capability can be compromised under conditions of environment misalignment. In this paper, we investigate two challenging conditions for environment misalignment: Cross-Domain and Cross-Context by proposing four datasets that are designed for these challenges: SimB-Border, SimB-Split, BlenB-Border, and BlenB-Split. Using RPCIN as a probe, experiments conducted on the combinations of the proposed datasets reveal potential weaknesses of the vision-based long-term dynamics prediction model. Furthermore, we propose a promising direction to mitigate the Cross-Domain challenge and provide concrete evidence supporting such a direction, which provides dramatic alleviation of the challenge on the proposed datasets.},

  abstract     = {Ad hoc teamwork requires an agent to cooperate with unknown teammates without prior coordination. Many works propose to abstract teammate instances into high-level representation of types and then pre-train the best response for each type. However, most of them do not consider the distribution of teammate instances within a type. This could expose the agent to the hidden risk of type confounding. In the worst case, the best response for an abstract teammate type could be the worst response for all specific instances of that type. This work addresses the issue from the lens of causal inference. We first theoretically demonstrate that this phenomenon is due to the spurious correlation brought by uncontrolled teammate distribution. Then, we propose our solution, CTCAT, which disentangles such correlation through an instance-wise teammate feedback rectification. This operation reweights the interaction of teammate instances within a shared type to reduce the influence of type confounding. The effect of CTCAT is evaluated in multiple domains, including classic ad hoc teamwork tasks and real-world scenarios. Results show that CTCAT is robust to the influence of type confounding, a practical issue that directly hazards the robustness of our trained agents but was unnoticed in previous works.},

  abstract     = {Learning a universal policy across different robot morphologies can significantly improve learning efficiency and generalization in continuous control. However, it poses a challenging multi-task reinforcement learning problem, as the optimal policy may be quite different across robots and critically depend on the morphology. Existing methods utilize graph neural networks or transformers to handle heterogeneous state and action spaces across different morphologies, but pay little attention to the dependency of a robot's control policy on its morphology context. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical architecture to better model this dependency via contextual modulation, which includes two key submodules: (1) Instead of enforcing hard parameter sharing across robots, we use hypernetworks to generate morphology-dependent control parameters; (2) We propose a fixed attention mechanism that solely depends on the morphology to modulate the interactions between different limbs in a robot. Experimental results show that our method not only improves learning performance on a diverse set of training robots, but also generalizes better to unseen morphologies in a zero-shot fashion.},

  abstract     = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become important machine learning tools for graph analysis, and its explainability is crucial for safety, fairness, and robustness. Layer-wise relevance propagation for GNNs (GNN-LRP) evaluates the relevance of walks to reveal important information flows in the network, and provides higher-order explanations, which have been shown to be superior to the lower-order, i.e., node-/edge-level, explanations. However, identifying relevant walks by GNN-LRP requires exponential computational complexity with respect to the network depth, which we will remedy in this paper. Specifically, we propose polynomial-time algorithms for finding top-$K$ relevant walks, which drastically reduces the computation and thus increases the applicability of GNN-LRP to large-scale problems. Our proposed algorithms are based on the max-product algorithm---a common tool for finding the maximum likelihood configurations in probabilistic graphical models---and can find the most relevant walks exactly at the neuron level and approximately at the node level. Our experiments demonstrate the performance of our algorithms at scale and their utility across application domains, i.e., on epidemiology, molecular, and natural language benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Language models (LMs) compute the probability of a text by sequentially computing a representation of an already-seen context and using this representation to predict the next word. Currently, most LMs calculate these representations through a neural network consuming the immediate previous context. However recently, retrieval-augmented LMs have shown to improve over standard neural LMs, by accessing information retrieved from a large datastore, in addition to their standard, parametric, next-word prediction. In this paper, we set out to understand why retrieval-augmented language models, and specifically why k-nearest neighbor language models (kNN-LMs) perform better than standard parametric LMs, even when the k-nearest neighbor component retrieves examples from the same training set that the LM was originally trained on. To this end, we perform a careful analysis of the various dimensions over which kNN-LM diverges from standard LMs, and investigate these dimensions one by one. Empirically, we identify three main reasons why kNN-LM performs better than standard LMs: using a different input representation for predicting the next tokens, approximate kNN search, and the importance of softmax temperature for the kNN distribution. Further, we incorporate these insights into the model architecture or the training procedure of the standard parametric LM, improving its results without the need for an explicit retrieval component.},

Different from current reconstruction-guided generative models and transformation-based contrastive models, we devise novel data-driven supervision for tabular data by introducing a characteristic -- scale -- as data labels. By representing varied sub-vectors of data instances, we define scale as the relationship between the dimensionality of original sub-vectors and that of representations. Scales serve as labels attached to transformed representations, thus offering ample labeled data for neural network training. Through this proxy task, our approach models inherent regularities and patterns within data, which well describes data normality. Abnormal degrees of testing instances are obtained by measuring whether they fit these learned patterns. Extensive experiments show that our approach leads to significant improvement over state-of-the-art generative/contrastive anomaly detection methods.},

In reality, agents often have to learn and maximize the rewards of the resources at the same time. To design an individualized competing policy, we model the competition between agents in a novel multi-player multi-armed bandit (MPMAB) setting where players are selfish and aim to maximize their own rewards. When several players pull the same arm, these players averagely share the arms' rewards by expectation. Under this setting, we first analyze the Nash equilibrium when arms' rewards are known, then propose a novel Selfish MPMAB with Averaging Allocation (SMAA) approach based on the equilibrium. We theoretically demonstrate that SMAA could achieve a good regret guarantee for each player when all players follow the algorithm.},

We then show that MixFlows have MCMC-like convergence guarantees when the flow map is ergodic and measure-preserving, and provide bounds on the accumulation of error for practical implementations where the flow map is approximated. Finally, we develop an implementation of MixFlows based on uncorrected discretized Hamiltonian dynamics combined with deterministic momentum refreshment. Simulated and real data experiments show that MixFlows can provide more reliable posterior approximations than several black-box normalizing flows, as well as samples of comparable quality to those obtained from state-of-the-art MCMC methods.},

We reveal a fundamental relationship between bit allocation in NVC and Semi-Amortized Variational Inference (SAVI). Specifically, we show that SAVI with GoP (Group-of-Picture)-level likelihood is equivalent to pixel-level bit allocation with precise rate and quality dependency model. Based on this equivalence, we establish a new paradigm of bit allocation using SAVI. Different from previous bit allocation methods, our approach requires no empirical model and is thus optimal. We extend the SAVI to multi-level such as NVC by recursively applying back-propagating through gradient ascent, and propose a tractable approximation for practical implementation. Experimental results show that current state-of-the-art bit allocation algorithms still have room of approximately 0.5 dB PSNR to improve compared with ours.},

  abstract     = {The capability to generate responses with diversity and faithfulness using factual knowledge is paramount for creating a human-like, trustworthy dialogue system. Common strategies either adopt a two-step paradigm, which optimizes knowledge selection and response generation separately, and may overlook the inherent correlation between these two tasks, or leverage conditional variational method to jointly optimize knowledge selection and response generation by employing an inference network. In this paper, we present an end-to-end learning framework, termed Sequential Posterior Inference (SPI), capable of selecting knowledge and generating dialogues by approximately sampling from the posterior distribution. Unlike other methods, SPI does not require the inference network or assume a simple geometry of the posterior distribution. This straightforward and intuitive inference procedure of SPI directly queries the response generation model, allowing for accurate knowledge selection and generation of faithful responses. In addition to modeling contributions, our experimental results on two common dialogue datasets (Wizard of Wikipedia and Holl-E) demonstrate that SPI outperforms previous strong baselines according to both automatic and human evaluation metrics.},

The recently discovered Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon provides a new perspective of understanding such last layer geometry of neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel metric, named Variability Collapse Index (VCI), to quantify the variability collapse phenomenon in the NC paradigm. The VCI metric is well-motivated and intrinsically related to the linear probing loss on the last layer features. Moreover, it enjoys desired theoretical and empirical properties, including invariance under invertible linear transformations and numerical stability, that distinguishes it from previous metrics.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a new family of physics-inspired generative models termed PFGM++ that unifies diffusion models and Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM). These models realize generative trajectories for N dimensional data by embedding paths in N+D dimensional space while still controlling the progression with a simple scalar norm of the D additional variables. The new models reduce to PFGM when D=1 and to diffusion models when D→∞. The flexibility of choosing D allows us to trade off robustness against rigidity as increasing D results in more concentrated coupling between the data and the additional variable norms. We dispense with the biased large batch field targets used in PFGM and instead provide an unbiased perturbation-based objective similar to diffusion models. To explore different choices of D, we provide a direct alignment method for transferring well-tuned hyperparameters from diffusion models (D→∞) to any finite D values. Our experiments show that models with finite D can be superior to previous state-of-the-art diffusion models on CIFAR-10/FFHQ 64×64 datasets, with FID scores of 1.91/2.43 when D=2048/128. In class-conditional setting, D=2048 yields current state-of-the-art FID of 1.74 on CIFAR-10. In addition, we demonstrate that models with smaller D exhibit improved robustness against modeling errors.},

Inspired by the recent huge success of Stable (latent) Diffusion models, we propose a novel and principled method for 3D molecule generation named Geometric Latent Diffusion Models (GeoLDM). GeoLDM is the first latent DM model for the molecular geometry domain, composed of autoencoders encoding structures into continuous latent codes and DMs operating in the latent space. Our key innovation is that for modeling the 3D molecular geometries, we capture its critical roto-translational equivariance constraints by building a point-structured latent space with both invariant scalars and equivariant tensors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoLDM can consistently achieve better performance on multiple molecule generation benchmarks, with up to 7% improvement for the valid percentage of large biomolecules. Results also demonstrate GeoLDM's higher capacity for controllable generation thanks to the latent modeling.},

We specifically account for the nature that time series data are non-exchangeable, and thus many existing conformal prediction algorithms are not applicable. The main idea is to adaptively re-estimate the conditional quantile of non-conformity scores (e.g., prediction residuals), upon exploiting the temporal dependence among them. More precisely, we cast the problem of conformal prediction interval as predicting the quantile of a future residual, given a user-specified point prediction algorithm. Theoretically, we establish asymptotic valid conditional coverage upon extending consistency analyses in quantile regression. Using simulation and real-data experiments, we demonstrate a significant reduction in interval width of SPCI compared to other existing methods under the desired empirical coverage.},

  abstract     = {Current protein language models (PLMs) learn protein representations mainly based on their sequences, thereby well capturing co-evolutionary information, but they are unable to explicitly acquire protein functions, which is the end goal of protein representation learning. Fortunately, for many proteins, their textual property descriptions are available, where their various functions are also described. Motivated by this fact, we first build the ProtDescribe dataset to augment protein sequences with text descriptions of their functions and other important properties. Based on this dataset, we propose the ProtST framework to enhance Protein Sequence pre-training and understanding by biomedical Texts. During pre-training, we design three types of tasks, i.e., unimodal mask prediction, multimodal representation alignment and multimodal mask prediction, to enhance a PLM with protein property information. On downstream tasks, ProtST enables both supervised learning and zero-shot prediction. We verify the superiority of ProtST-induced PLMs over previous ones on diverse representation learning benchmarks. Under the zero-shot setting, we show the effectiveness of ProtST on zero-shot protein classification, and ProtST also enables functional protein retrieval from a large-scale database without any function annotation.},

In this work, we present mPLUG-2, a new unified paradigm with modularized design for multi-modal pretraining, which can benefit from modality collaboration while addressing the problem of modality entanglement. In contrast to predominant paradigms of solely relying on sequence-to-sequence generation or encoder-based instance discrimination, mPLUG-2 introduces a multi-module composition network by sharing common universal modules for modality collaboration and disentangling different modality modules to deal with modality entanglement. It is flexible to select different modules for different understanding and generation tasks across all modalities including text, image, and video. Empirical study shows that mPLUG-2 achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results on a broad range of over 30 downstream tasks, spanning multi-modal tasks of image-text and video-text understanding and generation, and uni-modal tasks of text-only, image-only, and video-only understanding. Notably, mPLUG-2 shows new state-of-the-art results of 48.0 top-1 accuracy and 80.3 CIDEr on the challenging MSRVTT video QA and video caption tasks with a far smaller model size and data scale. It also demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability on vision-language and video-language tasks.},

This is the first approach to make Bayesian-type algorithms prior-free and applicable to adversarial settings, in a generic and optimal manner. Moreover, the algorithms are simple and often efficient to implement. As a major application, we present a novel algorithm for multi-armed bandits that achieves the ``best-of-all-worlds'' empirical performance in the stochastic, adversarial, and non-stationary environments. And we illustrate how these principles can be used in linear bandits, convex bandits, and reinforcement learning.},

In this paper, we combine sparsification-based gradient compression with the layer-wise adaptive moments optimizer for large batch training (LAMB). We propose SLAMB, a novel communication-efficient optimizer that supports large batch sizes and scales to thousands of GPUs. SLAMB employs momentum masking, local error compensation, and element-wise adaptive rescaling to achieve accurate layer-wise weight updates, which translates to fast convergence for very large batches. Our empirical results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art, SLAMB transmits half the amount of data in large-batch BERT pre-training, without sacrificing accuracy.},

However, these methods inherit issues from the conventional NAS methods, such as high computational cost and optimization difficulty. More importantly, previous NAS methods have ignored the uniqueness of GNNs, where GNNs possess expressive power without training. With the randomly-initialized weights, we can then seek the optimal architecture parameters via the sparse coding objective and derive a novel NAS-GNNs method, namely neural architecture coding (NAC). Consequently, our NAC holds a no-update scheme on GNNs and can efficiently compute in linear time. Empirical evaluations on multiple GNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance, which is up to 200× faster and 18.8\% more accurate than existing methods.},

We give quantum algorithms that find coresets for $k$-clustering in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{nk}d^{3/2})$ query complexity. Our coreset reduces the input size from $n$ to $\mathrm{poly}(k\varepsilon^{-1}d)$, so that existing $\alpha$-approximation algorithms for clustering can run on top of it and yield $(1 + \varepsilon)\alpha$-approximation. This eventually yields a quadratic speedup for various $k$-clustering approximation algorithms.

Yet, there is no theoretical understanding of class collapse or feature suppression at test time. We provide the first unified theoretically rigorous framework to determine which features are learnt by CL. Our analysis indicate that, perhaps surprisingly, bias of (stochastic) gradient descent towards finding simpler solutions is a key factor in collapsing subclass representations and suppressing harder class-relevant features.},

  abstract     = {Humans have the ability to adapt the type of information they use, the procedure they employ, and the amount of time they spend when solving problems. However, most standard neural networks have a fixed function type and computation budget regardless of the sample's nature or difficulty. Adaptivity is a powerful paradigm as it not only imbues practitioners with flexibility pertaining to the downstream usage of these models but can also serve as a powerful inductive bias for solving certain challenging classes of problems. In this work, we introduce a new approach called AdaTape, which allows for dynamic computation in neural networks through adaptive tape tokens. AdaTape utilizes an elastic input sequence by equipping an architecture with a dynamic read-and-write tape. Specifically, we adaptively generate input sequences using tape tokens obtained from a tape bank which can be either trainable or derived from input data.},

  abstract     = {Recent works have shown that tackling offline reinforcement learning (RL) with a conditional policy produces promising results. The Decision Transformer (DT) combines the conditional policy approach and a transformer architecture, showing competitive performance against several benchmarks. However, DT lacks stitching ability -- one of the critical abilities for offline RL to learn the optimal policy from sub-optimal trajectories. This issue becomes particularly significant when the offline dataset only contains sub-optimal trajectories. In this paper, we propose the Q-learning Decision Transformer (QDT) to address the shortcomings of DT by leveraging the benefits of Dynamic Programming (Q-learning). It utilises the Dynamic Programming results to relabel the return-to-go in the training data to then train the DT with the relabelled data. Our approach efficiently exploits the benefits of these two approaches and compensates for each other's shortcomings to achieve better performance.},

  abstract     = {A significant challenge in the field of quantum machine learning (QML) is to establish applications of quantum computation to accelerate common tasks in machine learning such as those for neural networks. Ridgelet transform has been a fundamental mathematical tool in the theoretical studies of neural networks, but the practical applicability of ridgelet transform to conducting learning tasks was limited since its numerical implementation by conventional classical computation requires an exponential runtime $\exp(O(D))$ as data dimension $D$ increases. To address this problem, we develop a quantum ridgelet transform (QRT), which implements the ridgelet transform of a quantum state within a linear runtime $O(D)$ of quantum computation. As an application, we also show that one can use QRT as a fundamental subroutine for QML to efficiently find a sparse trainable subnetwork of large shallow wide neural networks without conducting large-scale optimization of the original network. This application discovers an efficient way in this regime to demonstrate the lottery ticket hypothesis on finding such a sparse trainable neural network. These results open an avenue of QML for accelerating learning tasks with commonly used classical neural networks.},

Strongly monotone games are of particular interest since they have benign properties and also relate to many classic games that have applications in real life. Existing works mainly focus on the time-invariant case with provable guarantees established. However, the research of the more general time-varying games in changing environments is underexplored and the best-known result cannot match the guarantees in the time-invariant case. In this work, we present a new decentralized online algorithm for time-varying strongly monotone games, which greatly improves existing results and obtains fast rates, matching the best time-invariant guarantee without knowing the environmental non-stationarity. Furthermore, to achieve faster rates, we generalize the RVU property with smoothness and establish a series of problem-dependent bounds that also match the best time-invariant one. To realize all those results, we make a comprehensive use of the techniques in non-stationary and universal online learning.},

Both methods need only O(1) samples per worker for each proximal update, which is important to achieve good generalization performance on training deep neural networks. With a smoothness condition on the expected loss function (but not on each sample function), the proposed methods can achieve an optimal sample complexity result to produce a near-stationary point.

Despite this severe limitation, no established benchmarks exist for video generation with long temporal dependencies. In this paper, we curate 3 challenging video datasets with long-range dependencies by rendering walks through 3D scenes of procedural mazes, Minecraft worlds, and indoor scans. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of current models and observe their limitations in temporal consistency. Moreover, we introduce the Temporally Consistent Transformer (TECO), a generative model that substantially improves long-term consistency while also reducing sampling time. By compressing its input sequence into fewer embeddings, applying a temporal transformer, and expanding back using a spatial MaskGit, TECO outperforms existing models across many metrics.},

  abstract     = {Standard MSE or MAE loss function is commonly used in limited field-of-vision depth completion, treating each pixel equally under a basic assumption that all pixels have same contribution during optimization. Recently, with the rapid rise of panoramic photography, panoramic depth completion (PDC) has raised increasing attention in 3D computer vision. However, the assumption is inapplicable to panoramic data due to its latitude-wise distortion and high uncertainty nearby textures and edges. To handle these challenges, we propose distortion and uncertainty aware loss (DUL) that consists of a distortion-aware loss and an uncertainty-aware loss. The distortion-aware loss is designed to tackle the panoramic distortion caused by equirectangular projection, whose coordinate transformation relation is used to adaptively calculate the weight of the latitude-wise distortion, distributing uneven importance instead of the equal treatment for each pixel. The uncertainty-aware loss is presented to handle the inaccuracy in non-smooth regions. Specifically, we characterize uncertainty into PDC solutions under Bayesian deep learning framework, where a novel consistent uncertainty estimation constraint is designed to learn the consistency between multiple uncertainty maps of a single panorama. This consistency constraint allows model to produce more precise uncertainty estimation that is robust to feature deformation. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method over standard loss functions, reaching the state of the art.},

In this paper, for the first time to our best knowledge, we propose a quantum 3D embedding ansatz that learns the latent representation of 3D structures from the Hilbert space composed of the Bloch sphere of each qubit. Specifically, the 3D Cartesian coordinates of nodes are converted into rotation and torsion angles and then encode them into the form of qubits. Moreover, Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) is applied to serve as the trainable layers and the output of the PQC is adopted as the final node embedding. Experimental results on two downstream tasks, molecular property prediction and 3D molecular geometries generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. We show the capacity and capability of our model with the evaluation on the QM9 dataset (134k molecules) with very few parameters, and its potential to be executed on a real quantum device.},

Under mild assumptions, our objective maximizes the {MI} between different behaviors based on the same skill, which serves as an upper bound of the previous {MI} objective.

Backmapping is the opposite operation of bringing lost atomistic details back from the {CG} representation. While machine learning ({ML}) has produced accurate and efficient {CG} simulations of proteins, fast and reliable backmapping remains a challenge. Rule-based methods produce poor all-atom geometries, needing computationally costly refinement through additional simulations. Recently proposed {ML} approaches outperform traditional baselines but are not transferable between proteins and sometimes generate unphysical atom placements with steric clashes and implausible torsion angles. This work addresses both issues to build a fast, transferable, and reliable generative backmapping tool for {CG} protein representations. We achieve generalization and reliability through a combined set of innovations: representation based on internal coordinates; an equivariant encoder/prior; a custom loss function that helps ensure local structure, global structure, and physical constraints; and expert curation of high-quality out-of-equilibrium protein data for training. Our results pave the way for out-of-the-box backmapping of coarse-grained simulations for arbitrary proteins.},

  abstract     = {Deep equilibrium ({DEQ}) models replace the multiple-layer stacking of conventional deep networks with a fixed-point iteration of a single-layer transformation. Having been demonstrated to be competitive in a variety of real-world scenarios, the adversarial robustness of general {DEQs} becomes increasingly crucial for their reliable deployment. Existing works improve the robustness of general {DEQ} models with the widely-used adversarial training ({AT}) framework, but they fail to exploit the structural uniquenesses of {DEQ} models. To this end, we interpret {DEQs} through the lens of neural dynamics and find that {AT} under-regulates intermediate states. Besides, the intermediate states typically provide predictions with a high prediction entropy. Informed by the correlation between the entropy of dynamical systems and their stability properties, we propose reducing prediction entropy by progressively updating inputs along the neural dynamics. During {AT}, we also utilize random intermediate states to compute the loss function. Our methods regulate the neural dynamics of {DEQ} models in this manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods substantially increase the robustness of {DEQ} models and even outperform the strong deep network baselines.},

  abstract     = {The successes of modern deep machine learning methods are founded on their ability to transform inputs across multiple layers to build good high-level representations. It is therefore critical to understand this process of representation learning. However, standard theoretical approaches (formally {NNGPs}) involving infinite width limits eliminate representation learning. We therefore develop a new infinite width limit, the Bayesian representation learning limit, that exhibits representation learning mirroring that in finite-width models, yet at the same time, retains some of the simplicity of standard infinite-width limits. In particular, we show that Deep Gaussian processes ({DGPs}) in the Bayesian representation learning limit have exactly multivariate Gaussian posteriors, which leads to practical algorithmic implications. We call the resulting practical algorithm deep kernel machines ({DKMs}). Unlike most recent work on deep learning theory, our work not only proposes a more accurate theoretical model, but also provides a theoretical basis for a practical algorithm which we show performs well in practice.},

The graph matching problem arises in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing and bioinformatics, and in particular, matching graphs with inherent community structure has significance related to de-anonymization of correlated social networks. Compared to the correlated Erd{\H o}s-R{\'e}nyi ({ER}) model, where various efficient algorithms have been developed, among which a few algorithms have been proven to achieve the exact matching with constant edge correlation, no low-order polynomial algorithm has been known to achieve exact matching for the correlated {SBMs} with constant correlation. This work proposes an efficient algorithm for matching graphs with community structure, based on the comparison between partition trees rooted from each vertex, by extending the idea of Mao et al. (2021) to graphs with communities. Theoretically, we prove that our algorithm succeeds in exact recovery with high probability when the edge probability is {$\Omega(n^{-1+\epsilon})$} for any {$\epsilon > 0$} under the assumption that the number of communities is bounded. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing methods in various settings.},

  abstract     = {Recent work has observed an intriguing "Neural Collapse" phenomenon in well-trained neural networks, where the last-layer representations of training samples with the same label collapse into each other. This appears to suggest that the last-layer representations are completely determined by the labels, and do not depend on the intrinsic structure of input distribution. We provide evidence that this is not a complete description, and that the apparent collapse hides important fine-grained structure in the representations. Specifically, even when representations apparently collapse, the small amount of remaining variation can still faithfully and accurately capture the intrinsic structure of input distribution. As an example, if we train on {CIFAR}-10 using only 5 coarse-grained labels (by combining two classes into one super-class) until convergence, we can reconstruct the original 10-class labels from the learned representations via unsupervised clustering. The reconstructed labels achieve 93\% accuracy on the {CIFAR}-10 test set, nearly matching the normal {CIFAR}-10 accuracy for the same architecture. We also provide an initial theoretical result showing the fine-grained representation structure in a simplified synthetic setting. Our results show concretely how the structure of input data can play a significant role in determining the fine-grained structure of neural representations, going beyond what Neural Collapse predicts.},

Specifically, a generator learns a group of transformations applied to the data, which preserve the original distribution and fool the discriminator. {LieGAN} represents symmetry as interpretable Lie algebra basis and can discover various symmetries such as the rotation group {SO(n)}, restricted Lorentz group {SO(1,3)+} in trajectory prediction and top-quark tagging tasks. The learned symmetry can also be readily used in several existing equivariant neural networks to improve accuracy and generalization in prediction.},

In particular, online fine-tuning has become a commonly used method to correct the erroneous estimates of out-of-distribution data learned in the offline training phase. However, even limited online interactions can be inaccessible or catastrophic for high-stake scenarios like healthcare and autonomous driving. In this work, we introduce an interaction-free training scheme dubbed Offline-with-Action-Preferences (OAP). The main insight is that, compared to online fine-tuning, querying the preferences between pre-collected and learned actions can be equally or even more helpful to the erroneous estimate problem. By adaptively encouraging or suppressing policy constraint according to action preferences, OAP could distinguish overestimation from beneficial policy improvement and thus attains a more accurate evaluation of unseen data. Theoretically, we prove a lower bound of the behavior policy's performance improvement brought by OAP. Moreover, comprehensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark and state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate that OAP yields higher (29% on average) scores, especially on challenging AntMaze tasks (98% higher).},

The data augmentation techniques seem straightforward yet promising to enhance active learning by extending the exploration of the input space, which helps locate more valuable samples. In this work, we thoroughly study the coupling of data augmentation and active learning, thereby proposing Controllable Augmentation ManiPulator for Active Learning. In contrast to the few prior works that touched on this line, CAMPAL emphasizes a purposeful, tighten, and better-controlled integration of data augmentation into active learning in three folds: (i) carefully designed augmentation policies applied separately on labeled and unlabeled data pools; (ii) controlled and quantifiably optimizable augmentation strengths; (iii) full and flexible coverage for most (if not all) active learning schemes. Theories are proposed and associated with the development of key components in CAMPAL. Through extensive empirical experiments, we bring the performance of active learning methods to a new level: an absolute performance boost of 16.99% on CIFAR-10 and 12.25% on SVHN with 1,000 annotated samples.},

In this paper, we study out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of offline GCRL both theoretically and empirically to identify factors that are important. In a number of experiments, we observe that weighted imitation learning enjoys better generalization than pessimism-based offline RL method. Based on this insight, we derive a theory for OOD generalization, which characterizes several important design choices. We then propose a new offline GCRL method, Generalizable Offline goAl-condiTioned RL (GOAT), by combining the findings from our theoretical and empirical studies. On a new benchmark containing 9 independent identically distributed (IID) tasks and 17 OOD tasks, GOAT outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.},

Here, we propose a neural network model to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) - one of the standard intelligence tests in human psychology. Specifically, we design a reasoning block based on the well-known concept of prediction error (PE) in neuroscience. Our reasoning block uses convolution to extract abstract rules from high-level visual features of the 8 context images and generates the features of a predicted answer. PEs are then calculated between the predicted features and those of the 8 candidate answers, and are then passed to the next stage. We further integrate our novel reasoning blocks into a residual network and build a new Predictive Reasoning Network (PredRNet). Extensive experiments show that our proposed PredRNet achieves state-of-the-art average performance on several important RPM benchmarks. PredRNet also shows good generalization abilities in a variety of out-of-distribution scenarios and other visual reasoning tasks. Most importantly, our PredRNet forms low-dimensional representations of abstract rules and minimizes hierarchical prediction errors during model training, supporting the critical role of PE minimization in visual reasoning.},

Yet, little is understood on the variation in mechanisms that cause subpopulation shifts, and how algorithms generalize across such diverse shifts at scale. In this work, we provide a fine-grained analysis of subpopulation shift. We first propose a unified framework that dissects and explains common shifts in subgroups. We then establish a comprehensive benchmark of 20 state-of-the-art algorithms evaluated on 12 real-world datasets in vision, language, and healthcare domains. With results obtained from training over 10,000 models, we reveal intriguing observations for future progress in this space. First, existing algorithms only improve subgroup robustness over certain types of shifts but not others. Moreover, while current algorithms rely on group-annotated validation data for model selection, we find that a simple selection criterion based on worst-class accuracy is surprisingly effective even without any group information. Finally, unlike existing works that solely aim to improve worst-group accuracy (WGA), we demonstrate the fundamental tradeoff between WGA and other important metrics, highlighting the need to carefully choose testing metrics.},

To make use of the dataset containing label noise, two typical methods have been proposed. One is to employ the semi-supervised method by exploiting labeled confident examples and unlabeled unconfident examples. The other one is to model label noise and design statistically consistent classifiers. A natural question remains unsolved: which one should be used for a specific real-world application? In this paper, we answer the question from the perspective of causal data generative process. Specifically, the performance of the semi-supervised based method depends heavily on the data generative process while the method modeling label-noise is not influenced by the generation process. For example, for a given dataset, if it has a causal generative structure that the features cause the label, the semi-supervised based method would not be helpful. When the causal structure is unknown, we provide an intuitive method to discover the causal structure for a given dataset containing label noise.},

This work provides theoretical insights into these research questions. We model the creators' competition under the assumptions that: 1) the platform employs an innocuous top-K recommendation policy; 2) user decisions follow the Random Utility model; 3) content creators compete for user engagement and, without knowing their utility function in hindsight, apply arbitrary no-regret learning algorithms to update their strategies. We study the user welfare guarantee through the lens of Price of Anarchy and show that the fraction of user welfare loss due to creator competition is always upper bounded by a small constant depending on K and randomness in user decisions; we also prove the tightness of this bound. Our result discloses an intrinsic merit of the relevance-driven recommendation policy, as long as users' decisions involve randomness and the platform provides reasonably many alternatives to its users.},

In this paper, we present an analysis of second-order non-homogeneous PDEs, which are classified into three categories and applicable to various common problems. We also characterize the connections between the training loss and actual error, guaranteeing convergence under mild conditions. The theoretical analysis inspires us to further propose MultiAdam, a scale-invariant optimizer that leverages gradient momentum to parameter-wisely balance the loss terms.

However, limiting applicability, existing theoretical results assume variations of a "population generative model", which allows arbitrary modifications of the population distribution by the learning algorithm. Moreover, learning algorithms typically work on abstract simulators with population instead of the $N$-player game. Instead, we show that $N$ agents running policy mirror ascent converge to the Nash equilibrium of the regularized game within $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples from a single sample trajectory without a population generative model, up to a standard $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ error due to the mean field. Taking a divergent approach from the literature, instead of working with the best-response map we first show that a policy mirror ascent map can be used to construct a contractive operator having the Nash equilibrium as its fixed point. We analyze single-path TD learning for $N$-agent games, proving sample complexity guarantees by only using a sample path from the $N$-agent simulator without a population generative model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methodology allows for independent learning by $N$ agents with finite sample guarantees.},

However, these models store all learned knowledge (e.g., the appearance of the Eiffel Tower) in the model parameters, requiring increasingly larger models and training data to capture more knowledge. To integrate knowledge in a more scalable and modular way, we propose a retrieval-augmented multimodal model, which enables a base multimodal model (generator) to refer to relevant text and images fetched by a retriever from external memory (e.g., documents on the web). We introduce the first multimodal model that can retrieve and generate both text and images, called RA-CM3 (Retrieval-Augmented CM3).

In this work, we systematically formulate in-context example selection as a subset selection problem, and optimize it in an end-to-end fashion. We propose CEIL (Compositional Exemplars for In-context Learning), which is instantiated by Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) to model the interaction between the given input and in-context examples, and optimized through a carefully-designed contrastive learning objective to obtain preference from LMs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CEIL substantially outperforms all baseline methods on 12 classification and generation tasks.},

In this paper, we ask the question of how much pre-training over training environments can be helpful for efficient and effective fine-tuning. We provide two surprising results. First, we show that asymptotically, the improvement from pre-training is at most a constant factor. We give this result by designing a specific target environment where any benefit from pre-training is negligible. Second, in the non-asymptotic regime, we show pre-training can indeed be helpful by designing a policy collection-elimination (PCE) algorithm and proving a distribution-dependent regret bound that is independent of the state-action space. We believe both the asymptotic result and the algorithm contribute to a better understanding of pre-training in RL.},

To address this issue, the core idea is to learn a collaboration graph, which models the benefits from each pairwise collaboration and allocates appropriate collaboration strengths. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized FL algorithm, pFedGraph, which consists of two key modules: (1) inferring the collaboration graph based on pairwise model similarity and dataset size at server to promote fine-grained collaboration and (2) optimizing local model with the assistance of aggregated model at client to promote personalization. We theoretically analyze the convergence rate of pFedGraph and show that the learned collaboration weights are optimal.

In this paper, we present a GNN\&GBDT-guided fast optimizing framework for large-scale IPs that only uses a small-scale optimizer to solve large-scale IPs efficiently. The framework can be divided into three stages: Multi-task GNN Embedding to generate the embedding space, GBDT Prediction to effectively use the embedding spatial information, and Neighborhood Optimization to solve large-scale problems fast using the small-scale optimizer. Extensive experiments show that our framework can solve IPs with millions of scales and surpass SCIP and Gurobi in the specified wall-clock time using only a small-scale optimizer with 30\% of the problem size. Our framework can save 99\% of running time in achieving the same solution quality as SCIP, which verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework in solving large-scale IPs.},

However, data heterogeneity, especially the category distribution heterogeneity, poses significant challenges to FL performance. Most previous works consider either regularizing local models or fine-tuning the global model, while they ignore the adjustment of aggregation weights and simply assign weights based on the dataset size. In this paper, we found through empirical observations and theoretical analysis that dataset size is not optimal and the discrepancy between local and global category distributions could be a beneficial and complementary indicator for determining aggregation weights. Based on this insight, we propose FedDisco, whose aggregation weights not only involve both the dataset size and the discrepancy value, but also contribute to a tighter theoretical upper bound of the optimization error. FedDisco promotes utility and modularity in a communication- and computation-efficient way. Extensive experiments show that FedDisco outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and can be easily incorporated with many existing methods to further enhance the performance.},

Recent quantum algorithms provide a new perspective for solving CO problems and have the potential to demonstrate quantum advantage. While Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a well-known quantum heuristic for CO constructed by a parametric quantum circuit, QAOA is originally designed for unconstrained problems and the circuit parameters and solutions are jointly solved with time-consuming iterations. In this paper, we propose a quantum neural network (QNN) for learning CO problems in a supervised manner to achieve better and faster results. We focus on the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) with matching constraints and the node permutation invariance property. A quantum neural network called QAP-QNN is devised to translate the QAP into a constrained vertex classification task. We study two QAP tasks: Graph Matching and Traveling Salesman Problem on TorchQuantum simulators, and empirically show the effectiveness of our approach.},

We first introduce a common theoretical framework unifying dynamic survival analysis and early event prediction. Following an analysis of objectives from both fields, we propose Temporal Label Smoothing (TLS), a simpler, yet best-performing method that preserves prediction monotonicity over time. TLS is a novel learning strategy that modulates smoothing strength as a function of proximity to the event of interest. This regularization technique reduces model confidence at the class boundary, where the signal is often noisy or uninformative, thus allowing training to focus on clinically informative data points away from this boundary region. By focusing the objective on areas with a stronger predictive signal, TLS improves performance over all baselines on two large-scale benchmark tasks.},

Many traditional approaches of domain adaptation in RL manage to learn a mapping function between the source and target domain in explicit or implicit ways. However, they typically require access to abundant data from the target domain. Besides, they often rely on visual clues to learn the mapping function and may fail when the source domain looks quite different from the target domain. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework Online Prototype Alignment (OPA) to learn the mapping function based on the functional similarity of elements and is able to achieve the few-shot policy transfer within only several episodes. The key insight of OPA is to introduce an exploration mechanism that can interact with the unseen elements of the target domain in an efficient and purposeful manner, and then connect them with the seen elements in the source domain according to their functionalities instead of visual clues.},

In this setting, different agents may choose the same arm in the same time step but observe different feedback. The goal of each agent is to find a globally best arm in hindsight that has the lowest cumulative loss averaged over all agents, which necessitates communication among agents. We provide regret lower bounds for any federated bandit algorithm under different settings, when agents have access to full-information feedback, or bandit feedback.

We argue that despite the fact that many variants of {GANs} were developed following this paradigm, the current theoretical understanding of {GANs} and their practical algorithms are inconsistent. In this paper, we leverage {Wasserstein} gradient flows which characterize the evolution of particles in the sample space, to gain theoretical insights and algorithmic inspiration of {GANs}. We introduce a unified generative modeling framework - {MonoFlow}: the particle evolution is rescaled via a monotonically increasing mapping of the log density ratio. Under our framework, adversarial training can be viewed as a procedure first obtaining {MonoFlow}'s vector field via training the discriminator and the generator learns to draw the particle flow defined by the corresponding vector field. We also reveal the fundamental difference between variational divergence minimization and adversarial training. This analysis helps us to identify what types of generator loss functions can lead to the successful training of {GANs} and suggest that {GANs} may have more loss designs beyond the literature (e.g., non-saturated loss), as long as they realize {MonoFlow}. Consistent empirical studies are included to validate the effectiveness of our framework.},

However, there exists no principled methodological framework for diffusion on {SE}(3), the space of orientation preserving rigid motions in {$\mathbb{R}^3$}, that operates on frames and confers the group invariance. We address these shortcomings by developing theoretical foundations of {SE}(3) invariant diffusion models on multiple frames followed by a novel framework, {FrameDiff}, for learning the {SE}(3) equivariant score over multiple frames.

A credible solution is to explore additional labeled graphs to enhance unsupervised learning on the target domain. However, how to apply {GNNs} to domain adaptation remains unsolved owing to the insufficient exploration of graph topology and the significant domain discrepancy. In this paper, we propose Coupled Contrastive Graph Representation Learning ({CoCo}), which extracts the topological information from coupled learning branches and reduces the domain discrepancy with coupled contrastive learning. {CoCo} contains a graph convolutional network branch and a hierarchical graph kernel network branch, which explore graph topology in implicit and explicit manners. On the one hand, cross-branch contrastive learning encourages the agreement of coupled modules to generate comprehensive graph representations. On the other hand, cross-domain contrastive learning reduces the distances between cross-domain pairs with the same semantics for effective domain alignment. Extensive experiments on popular datasets show that our {CoCo} outperforms these competing baselines in different settings generally.},

It leverages extra learnable tokens, known as prompts, which steer the frozen pretrained {ViTs}. Although {VPT} has demonstrated its applicability with supervised vision transformers, it often underperforms with self-supervised ones. Through empirical observations, we deduce that the effectiveness of {VPT} hinges largely on the {ViT} blocks with which the prompt tokens interact. Specifically, {VPT} shows improved performance on image classification tasks for {MAE} and {MoCo} v3 when the prompt tokens are inserted into later blocks rather than the first block. These observations suggest that there exists an optimal location of blocks for the insertion of prompt tokens. Unfortunately, identifying the optimal blocks for prompts within each self-supervised {ViT} for diverse future scenarios is a costly process. To mitigate this problem, we propose a simple yet effective method that learns a gate for each {ViT} block to adjust its intervention into the prompt tokens. With our method, prompt tokens are selectively influenced by blocks that require steering for task adaptation. Our method outperforms {VPT} variants in {FGVC} and {VTAB} image classification and {ADE20K} semantic segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Recent end-to-end multi-object detectors simplify the inference pipeline by removing hand-crafted processes such as non-maximum suppression ({NMS}). However, during training, they still heavily rely on heuristics and hand-crafted processes which deteriorate the reliability of the predicted confidence score. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to train an end-to-end multi-object detector consisting of only two terms: negative log-likelihood ({NLL}) and a regularization term. In doing so, the multi-object detection problem is treated as density estimation of the ground truth bounding boxes utilizing a regularized mixture density model. The proposed end-to-end multi-object Detection with a Regularized Mixture Model ({D-RMM}) is trained by minimizing the {NLL} with the proposed regularization term, maximum component maximization ({MCM}) loss, preventing duplicate predictions. Our method reduces the heuristics of the training process and improves the reliability of the predicted confidence score. Moreover, our {D-RMM} outperforms the previous end-to-end detectors on {MS} {COCO} dataset.},

  abstract     = {As the field of Graph Neural Networks ({GNN}) continues to grow, it experiences a corresponding increase in the need for large, real-world datasets to train and test new {GNN} models on challenging, realistic problems. Unfortunately, such graph datasets are often generated from online, highly privacy-restricted ecosystems, which makes research and development on these datasets hard, if not impossible. This greatly reduces the amount of benchmark graphs available to researchers, causing the field to rely only on a handful of publicly-available datasets. To address this problem, we introduce a novel graph generative model, Computation Graph Transformer ({CGT}) that learns and reproduces the distribution of real-world graphs in a privacy-controlled way. More specifically, {CGT} (1) generates effective benchmark graphs on which {GNNs} show similar task performance as on the source graphs, (2) scales to large graphs, and (3) achieves strong privacy guarantees. We conduct extensive experiments on seven graph datasets and demonstrate that {CGT} successfully generates synthetic graphs that produce near-identical task performance across various {GNN} models while strongly preserving privacy.},

In contrast to conventional methods, it is trained with oracle guidance, which is derived from the target sequence. Since the oracle guidance compactly represents the target-side context that can assist the sequence model in solving the task, the {EM}-Network achieves a better prediction compared to using only the source input. To allow the sequence model to inherit the promising capability of the {EM}-Network, we propose a new self-distillation strategy, where the original sequence model can benefit from the knowledge of the {EM}-Network in a one-stage manner. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two types of seq2seq models: connectionist temporal classification ({CTC}) for speech recognition and attention-based encoder-decoder ({AED}) for machine translation. Experimental results demonstrate that the {EM}-Network significantly advances the current state-of-the-art approaches, improving over the best prior work on speech recognition and establishing state-of-the-art performance on {WMT}'14 and {IWSLT}'14.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the efficiency and rapid convergence of pre-trained models for solving downstream tasks, this paper extensively studies the impact of Continual Learning ({CL}) models as pre-trainers. We find that, in both supervised and unsupervised {CL}, the transfer quality of representations does not show a noticeable degradation of fine-tuning performance but rather increases gradually. This is because {CL} models can learn improved task-general features when easily forgetting task-specific knowledge. Based on this observation, we suggest a new unsupervised {CL} framework with masked modeling, which aims to capture fluent task-generic representation during training. Furthermore, we propose a new fine-tuning scheme, {GLobal} {Attention} {Discretization} ({GLAD}), that preserves rich task-generic representation during solving downstream tasks. The model fine-tuned with {GLAD} achieves competitive performance and can also be used as a good pre-trained model itself. We believe this paper breaks the barriers between pre-training and fine-tuning steps and leads to a sustainable learning framework in which the continual learner incrementally improves model generalization, yielding better transfer to unseen tasks.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised object-centric representation ({OCR}) learning has recently drawn attention as a new paradigm of visual representation. This is because of its potential of being an effective pre-training technique for various downstream tasks in terms of sample efficiency, systematic generalization, and reasoning. Although image-based reinforcement learning ({RL}) is one of the most important and thus frequently mentioned such downstream tasks, the benefit in {RL} has surprisingly not been investigated systematically thus far. Instead, most of the evaluations have focused on rather indirect metrics such as segmentation quality and object property prediction accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of {OCR} pre-training for image-based reinforcement learning via empirical experiments. For systematic evaluation, we introduce a simple object-centric visual {RL} benchmark and conduct experiments to answer questions such as {``}Does {OCR} pre-training improve performance on object-centric tasks?{''} and {``}Can {OCR} pre-training help with out-of-distribution generalization?{''}. Our results provide empirical evidence for valuable insights into the effectiveness of {OCR} pre-training for {RL} and the potential limitations of its use in certain scenarios. Additionally, this study also examines the critical aspects of incorporating {OCR} pre-training in {RL}, including performance in a visually complex environment and the appropriate pooling layer to aggregate the object representations.},

It can be used for supervised learning when combined with classical gradient-based optimizers. Despite the existing empirical and theoretical investigations, the convergence of {QNN} training is not fully understood. Inspired by the success of the neural tangent kernels ({NTKs}) in probing into the dynamics of classical neural networks, a recent line of works proposes to study over-parameterized {QNNs} by examining a quantum version of tangent kernels. In this work, we study the dynamics of {QNNs} and show that contrary to popular belief it is qualitatively different from that of any kernel regression: due to the unitarity of quantum operations, there is a non-negligible deviation from the tangent kernel regression derived at the random initialization. As a result of the deviation, we prove the at-most sublinear convergence for {QNNs} with Pauli measurements, which is beyond the explanatory power of any kernel regression dynamics. We then present the actual dynamics of {QNNs} in the limit of over-parameterization. The new dynamics capture the change of convergence rate during training and implies that the range of measurements is crucial to the fast {QNN} convergence.},

The authors argue that local entropy of pixel neighborhoods and their temporal evolution create valuable intrinsic supervisory signals for learning prominent features. Building on this idea, they abstract visual features into a concise representation of keypoints that act as dynamic information transmitters, and design a deep learning model that learns, purely unsupervised, spatially and temporally consistent representations directly from video frames. The method uses two original information-theoretic losses, computed from local entropy, guide their model to discover consistent keypoint representations; a loss that maximizes the spatial information covered by the keypoints and a loss that optimizes the keypoints' information transportation over time. The empirical results show superior performance for their information-driven keypoints that resolve challenges like attendance to static and dynamic objects or objects abruptly entering and leaving the scene.},

Experience Replay ({ER}) can be considered a simple kind of model, which has proved effective at improving the stability and efficiency of deep {RL}. In principle, a learned parametric model could improve on {ER} by generalizing from real experience to augment the dataset with additional plausible experience. However, given that learned value functions can also generalize, it is not immediately obvious why model generalization should be better. Here, we provide theoretical and empirical insight into when, and how, we can expect data generated by a learned model to be useful. First, we provide a simple theorem motivating how learning a model as an intermediate step can narrow down the set of possible value functions more than learning a value function directly from data using the Bellman equation. Second, we provide an illustrative example showing empirically how a similar effect occurs in a more concrete setting with neural network function approximation. Finally, we provide extensive experiments showing the benefit of model-based learning for online {RL} in environments with combinatorial complexity, but factored structure that allows a learned model to generalize.},

Unfortunately, existing efforts suffer from drawbacks that would greatly impact their practicality: 1) robust accuracy (with defects) improvement at the cost of degraded clean accuracy (without defects); 2) no guarantee on better robust or clean accuracy using stronger {ECOCs}. In this paper, we first shed light on the connection between these drawbacks and error correlation, and then propose a novel comprehensive error decorrelation framework, namely {COLA}. Specifically, we propose to reduce inner layer feature error correlation by 1) adopting a separated architecture, where the last portions of the paths to all output nodes are separated, and 2) orthogonalizing weights in common {DNN} layers so that the intermediate features are orthogonal with each other. We also propose a regularization technique based on total correlation to mitigate overall error correlation at the outputs. The effectiveness of {COLA} is first analyzed theoretically, and then evaluated experimentally, e.g. up to 6.7\% clean accuracy improvement compared with the original {DNNs} and up to 40\% robust accuracy improvement compared to the state-of-the-art {ECOC}-enhanced {DNNs}.},

In this paper, we investigate and benchmark tricks for improving training data extraction using a publicly available dataset. Because most existing extraction methods use a pipeline of generating-then-ranking, i.e., generating text candidates as potential training data and then ranking them based on specific criteria, our research focuses on the tricks for both text generation (e.g., sampling strategy) and text ranking (e.g., token-level criteria). The experimental results show that several previously overlooked tricks can be crucial to the success of training data extraction.

Specifically, our framework consists of a latent conditional diffusion probabilistic model to perform waveform synthesis. Furthermore, a series of context-aware conditioning encoders are proposed to take temporal information into consideration for a long-term generation. Notably, we extend our model's applicability from dances to multiple sports scenarios such as floor exercise and figure skating.

  abstract     = {There is a growing interest in designing Graph Neural Networks ({GNN}s) for seeded graph matching, which aims to match two unlabeled graphs using only topological information and a small set of seed nodes. However, most previous {GNN}s for this task use a semi-supervised approach, which requires a large number of seeds and cannot learn knowledge that is transferable to unseen graphs. In contrast, this paper proposes a new supervised approach that can learn from a training set how to match unseen graphs with only a few seeds. Our {SeedGNN} architecture incorporates several novel designs, inspired by theoretical studies of seeded graph matching: 1) it can learn to compute and use witness-like information from different hops, in a way that can be generalized to graphs of different sizes; 2) it can use easily-matched node-pairs as new seeds to improve the matching in subsequent layers. We evaluate {SeedGNN} on synthetic and real-world graphs and demonstrate significant performance improvements over both non-learning and learning algorithms in the existing literature. Furthermore, our experiments confirm that the knowledge learned by {SeedGNN} from training graphs can be generalized to test graphs of different sizes and categories.},

Our key advance lies at the innovative design of {QHNet} architecture, which not only obeys the underlying symmetries, but also enables the reduction of number of tensor products by 92\%. In addition, {QHNet} prevents the exponential growth of channel dimension when more atom types are involved. We perform experiments on {MD}17 datasets, including four molecular systems.

In this paper, we consider a class of dynamic time-consistent risk measures, called Expected Conditional Risk Measures ({ECRM}s), and derive policy gradient updates for {ECRM}-based objective functions.

However, such a benefit is often diminished due to the marked state-action distribution shift, which causes significant bootstrap error and wipes out the good initial policy. Existing solutions resort to constraining the policy shift or balancing the sample replay based on their online-ness. However, they require online estimation of distribution divergence or density ratio. To avoid such complications, we propose deviating from existing actor-critic approaches that directly transfer the state-action value functions. Instead, we post-process them by aligning with the offline learned policy, so that the {Q}-values for actions outside the offline policy are also tamed.},

Inspired by recent findings, we hypothesize that we can address the above challenges with modules widely shared across languages. To this end, we propose an {ASR} framework, dubbed {Master-ASR}, that, for the first time, simultaneously achieves strong multilingual scalability and low-resource adaptation ability thanks to its modularize-then-assemble strategy. Specifically, {Master-ASR} learns a small set of generalizable sub-modules and adaptively assembles them for different languages to reduce the multilingual overhead and enable effective adaptation.},

This problem is difficult to solve since it is nonconvex. By exploiting the structure of the problem, we propose two Coordinate Descent ({CD}) methods for solving this problem. One is applied to the original fractional function, the other is based on the associated parametric problem. The proposed methods iteratively solve a one-dimensional subproblem globally, and they are guaranteed to converge to coordinate-wise stationary points. Under suitable conditions, {CD} methods with an appropriate initialization converge linearly to the optimal point (also the coordinate-wise stationary point). In the case of a concave denominator, we show that the resulting problem is quasi-convex, and any critical point is a global minimum. We prove that the algorithms converge to the global optimal solution with a sublinear convergence rate. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methods to some machine learning and signal processing models. Our experiments on real-world data have shown that our method significantly and consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy.},

Under this motivation, recent works on mode connectivity have shown that parameters of ensembles are connected by low-loss subspaces, and one can efficiently collect ensemble parameters in those subspaces. While this provides a way to efficiently train ensembles, for inference, multiple forward passes should still be executed using all the ensemble parameters, which often becomes a serious bottleneck for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose a novel framework to reduce such costs. Given a low-loss subspace connecting two modes of a neural network, we build an additional neural network that predicts the output of the original neural network evaluated at a certain point in the low-loss subspace. The additional neural network, which they call a ``bridge,'' is a lightweight network that takes minimal features from the original network and predicts outputs for the low-loss subspace without requiring multiple forward passes.},

However, we emphasize that the average coverage varies depending on the pattern of missing values: conformal methods tend to construct prediction intervals that undercover the response conditionally to some missing patterns. This motivates our novel generalized conformalized quantile regression framework, missing data augmentation, which yields prediction intervals that are valid conditionally to the patterns of missing values, despite their exponential number.},

Critical bottlenecks are due to the computation of partition functions in the denominator of softmax function as well as the multiplication of the softmax matrix with the matrix of values. Our key observation is that the former can be reduced to a variant of the kernel density estimation ({KDE}) problem, and an efficient {KDE} solver can be further utilized to accelerate the latter via subsampling-based fast matrix products. Our proposed {KDEformer} can approximate the attention in sub-quadratic time with provable spectral norm bounds, while all prior results merely provide entry-wise error bounds. Empirically, we verify that {KDEformer} outperforms other attention approximations in terms of accuracy, memory, and arithmetic operations on various pre-trained models. For instance, on {BigGAN} image generation we achieve better generative scores than the exact computation with over 4$\times$ speedup. For {ImageNet} classification with {T2T-ViT}, {KDEformer} shows over 18$\times$ speedup while the accuracy drop is less than 0.5\%.},

In this work, we relax this structural assumption and analyze the statistical complexity of off-policy reinforcement learning when only realizability holds for the prescribed function class. We establish finite-sample guarantees for off-policy reinforcement learning that are free of the approximation error term known as inherent Bellman error, and that depend on the interplay of three factors: the coverage provided by the behavior policy, the approximation power of the function class, and a measure of the complexity of the function class.},

Motivated by these considerations, we study a module which is a workhorse within modern {DNN} architectures, {GEMM} based Feed Forward Networks ({FFNs}), and assess the extent to which it can be made compute- (or {FLOP}-) lite. Specifically, we propose an alternative formulation (we call it {LookupFFN}) to {GEMM} based {FFNs} inspired by the recent studies of using Locality Sensitive Hashing ({LSH}) to approximate {FFNs}. Our formulation recasts most essential operations as a memory look-up, leveraging the trade-off between the two resources on any platform: compute and memory (since {CPUs} offer it in abundance). For {RoBERTa} language model pretraining, our formulation achieves similar performance compared to {GEMM} based {FFNs}, while dramatically reducing the required {FLOP}.},

In particular, we track the attention entropy for each attention head during the course of training, which is a proxy for model sharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and tasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability, which can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the pathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated attention scores, as entropy collapse. As a remedy, we propose $\sigma${Reparam}, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all linear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We demonstrate that $\sigma${Reparam} successfully prevents entropy collapse in the attention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally, we prove a tight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases exponentially fast with the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing additional motivation for our approach.},

  abstract     = {Generating molecules with high binding affinities to target proteins (a.k.a. structure-based drug design) is a fundamental and challenging task in drug discovery. Recently, deep generative models have achieved remarkable success in generating 3D molecules conditioned on the protein pocket. However, most existing methods consider molecular generation for protein pockets independently while neglecting the underlying connections such as subpocket-level similarities. Subpockets are the local protein environments of ligand fragments and pockets with similar subpockets may bind the same molecular fragment (motif) even though their overall structures are different. Therefore, the trained models can hardly generalize to unseen protein pockets in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel method {DrugGPS} for generalizable structure-based drug design. With the biochemical priors, we propose to learn subpocket prototypes and construct a global interaction graph to model the interactions between subpocket prototypes and molecular motifs. Moreover, a hierarchical graph transformer encoder and motif-based 3D molecule generation scheme are used to improve the model's performance.},

Compared with engaging all available clients, such random-selection mechanism could lead to significant performance degradation on non-IID data. The essential reason resulting in such performance degradation is the class-imbalance of the grouped data from randomly selected clients. Based on this observation, we design an efficient heterogeneity-aware client sampling mechanism, namely, Federated Class-balanced Sampling (Fed-CBS), which can effectively reduce class-imbalance of the grouped dataset from the intentionally selected clients. We employ homomorphic encryption to derive this measure in a privacy-preserving way and propose a computation-efficient client sampling strategy such that the actively selected clients will generate a more class-balanced grouped dataset with theoretical guarantees.},

We extend such results to generic continuous functions characterized by the modulus of continuity. The results reveal that a continuous-depth network generated via a dynamical system has immense approximation power even if its dynamics function is time-independent and realized by a fixed-size ReLU network.},

We find that merely training with different random seeds provides sufficient diversity to achieve excellent performances for a variety of problems involving changes in data distribution, revealing the limitations of representations constructed with a single training run.},

We make progress towards this open problem by showing the convergence rate of projected SARSA to a bounded region. The region is much smaller than the region that they project into, provided that the magnitude of the reward is not too large. Existing works regarding the convergence of linear SARSA to a fixed point all require the Lipschitz constant of SARSA's policy improvement operator to be sufficiently small; our analysis instead applies to arbitrary Lipschitz constants and thus characterizes the behavior of linear SARSA for a new regime.},

We formulate our attacks as optimization problems and solve them with a novel discrete optimization technique to overcome the discrete nature of graph-structured data.

We introduce a relaxed assumption that the input data are concentrated around a subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ denoted by $\mathcal{S}$, and the intrinsic dimension of $\mathcal{S}$ can be characterized by a new complexity notation -- effective Minkowski dimension. We show that the sample complexity of deep nonparametric regression only depends on the effective Minkowski dimension of $\mathcal{S}$. When the eigenvalues of $\Sigma$ have an exponential or polynomial decay, the effective Minkowski dimension is $p=\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\log n})$ or $p=\mathcal{O}(n^\gamma)$ respectively, where $n$ is the sample size and $\gamma\in(0,1)$ is a small constant. Our theory shows that when the manifold assumption does not hold, deep neural networks can still adapt to the effective Minkowski dimension of the data, and circumvent the curse of the ambient dimensionality for moderate sample sizes.},

  abstract     = {Image inpainting refers to the task of generating a complete, natural image based on a partially revealed reference image. Recently, many research interests have been focused on addressing this problem using fixed diffusion models. These approaches typically directly replace the revealed region of the intermediate or final generated images with that of the reference image or its variants. However, since the unrevealed regions are not directly modified to match the context, it results in incoherence between revealed and unrevealed regions. To address the incoherence problem, a small number of methods introduce a rigorous Bayesian framework, but they tend to introduce mismatches between the generated and the reference images due to the approximation errors in computing the posterior distributions. In this paper, we propose CoPaint, which can coherently inpaint the whole image without introducing mismatches. CoPaint also uses the Bayesian framework to jointly modify both revealed and unrevealed regions but approximates the posterior distribution in a way that allows the errors to gradually drop to zero throughout the denoising steps, thus strongly penalizing any mismatches with the reference image. Our experiments verify that CoPaint can outperform the existing diffusion-based methods under both objective and subjective metrics.},

To begin with, we establish the lower bound on the sample number and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the correct permutation recovery. Moreover, we present a simple yet effective estimator. Under mild conditions, we show that our estimator can restore the correct correspondence information with high probability. Numerical experiments are presented to corroborate our theoretical claims.},

In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of quantum lower bounds on finding $\epsilon$-approximate stationary points of nonconvex functions, and we consider the following two important settings: 1) having access to $p$-th order derivatives; or 2) having access to stochastic gradients. The classical query lower bounds are $\Omega\big(\epsilon^{-\frac{1+p}{p}}\big)$ regarding the first setting and $\Omega(\epsilon^{-4})$ regarding the second setting (or $\Omega(\epsilon^{-3})$ if the stochastic gradient function is mean-squared smooth). In this paper, we extend all these classical lower bounds to the quantum setting. They match the classical algorithmic results respectively, demonstrating that there is no quantum speedup for finding $\epsilon$-stationary points of nonconvex functions with $p$-th order derivative inputs or stochastic gradient inputs. Technically, we prove our quantum lower bounds by showing that the sequential nature of classical hard instances in all these settings also applies to quantum queries, preventing any quantum speedup other than revealing information of the stationary points sequentially.},

Our method first addresses irregularity in each single modality by (1) modeling irregular time series by dynamically incorporating hand-crafted imputation embeddings into learned interpolation embeddings via a gating mechanism, and (2) casting a series of clinical note representations as multivariate irregular time series and tackling irregularity via a time attention mechanism. We further integrate irregularity in multimodal fusion with an interleaved attention mechanism across temporal steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to thoroughly model irregularity in multimodalities for improving medical predictions. Our proposed methods for two medical prediction tasks consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in each single modality and multimodal fusion scenarios. Specifically, we observe relative improvements of 6.5\%, 3.6\%, and 4.3\% in F1 for time series, clinical notes, and multimodal fusion, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In personalized federated learning (PFL), multiple clients train customized models to fulfill their personal objectives, which, however, are prone to overfitting to local data due to the heterogeneity and scarcity of local data. To address this, we propose from the information-theoretic perspective a personalized federated learning framework based on the common representation learned across clients, named FedCR. Specifically, we introduce to the local client update a regularizer that aims at minimizing the discrepancy between local and global conditional mutual information (CMI), such that clients are encouraged to learn and exploit the common representation. Upon this, each client learns individually a customized predictor (head), while the extractor (body) remains to be aggregated by the server. Our CMI regularizer leads to a theoretically sound alignment between the local and global stochastic feature distributions in terms of their Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. More importantly, by modeling the global joint feature distribution as a product of multiple local feature distributions, clients can efficiently extract diverse information from the global data but without need of the raw data from other clients. We further show that noise injection via feature alignment and ensemble of local predictors in FedCR would help enhance its generalization capability. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate a consistent performance gain and better generalization behavior of FedCR.},

In addition, due to the heterogeneous data distribution and security requirements, simple and fast averaging aggregation is not feasible anymore. Instead, complicated aggregation operations, such as knowledge distillation, are required. The time cost for complicated aggregation becomes a new bottleneck that limits the computational efficiency of FL. In this work, we claim that the root cause of training latency actually lies in the aggregation-then-broadcasting workflow of the server. By swapping the computational order of aggregation and broadcasting, we propose a novel and efficient parallel federated learning (PFL) framework that unlocks the edge nodes during global computation and the central server during local computation.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning has seen wide success in finetuning large language models to better align with instructions via human feedback. The so-called algorithm, Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) demonstrates impressive performance on the GPT series models. However, the underlying reinforcement learning algorithm is complex and requires additional training for reward and value networks. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach: converting feedback to instruction by relabeling the original one and training the model for better alignment in a supervised manner. Such an algorithm doesn't require any additional parameters except for the original language model and maximally reuses the pretraining pipeline. To achieve this, we formulate instruction alignment problem for language models as a goal-reaching problem in decision making. We propose Hindsight Instruction Relabeling (HIR), a novel algorithm for aligning language models with instructions. The resulting two-stage algorithm shed light to a family of reward-free approaches that utilize the hindsightly relabeled instructions based on feedback. We evaluate the performance of HIR extensively on 12 challenging BigBench reasoning tasks and show that HIR outperforms the baseline algorithms and is comparable to or even surpasses supervised fine-tuning.},

Recently, the gradient of log probability density (a.k.a., score) w.r.t. the sample is used as an alternative statistic to compute. However, we find that the score is sensitive in identifying adversarial samples due to insufficient information with one sample only. In this paper, we propose a new statistic called expected perturbation score (EPS), which is essentially the expected score of a sample after various perturbations.

It is crucial to go one step further: adapting FL models to an open-world setting, where unseen classes exist in the unlabeled data.

To predict a diverse distribution of placements, existing methods usually establish a one-to-one mapping from random vectors to the placements. However, these random vectors are not interpretable, which prevents users from interacting with the object placement process. To address this problem, we propose an Interactive Object Placement method with Reinforcement Learning, dubbed IOPRE, to make sequential decisions for producing a reasonable placement given an initial location and size of the foreground. We first design a novel action space to flexibly and stably adjust the location and size of the foreground while preserving its aspect ratio.},

This paper presents a meta-analysis of existing definitions of disentanglement, using category theory as a unifying and rigorous framework. We propose that the concepts of the cartesian and monoidal products should serve as the core of disentanglement. With these core concepts, we show the similarities and crucial differences in dealing with (i) functions, (ii) equivariant maps, (iii) relations, and (iv) stochastic maps. Overall, our meta-analysis deepens our understanding of disentanglement and its various formulations and can help researchers navigate different definitions and choose the most appropriate one for their specific context.},

Existing algorithms for such scenarios typically require extensive hyperparameter tuning, which limits their practical effectiveness. The authors propose a framework called BALLET, which adaptively filters for a high-confidence region of interest (ROI) as a superlevel-set of a nonparametric probabilistic model such as a Gaussian process (GP). Their approach is easy to tune and is able to focus on local regions of the optimization space that can be tackled by existing BO methods. The key idea is to use two probabilistic models: a coarse GP to identify the ROI, and a localized GP for optimization within the ROI. They show theoretically that BALLET can efficiently shrink the search space, and can exhibit a tighter regret bound than standard BO without ROI filtering. They demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of BALLET on both synthetic and real-world optimization tasks.},

When a model does fail during deployment, attributing performance change to these factors is critical for the model developer to identify the root cause and take mitigating actions. In this work, we introduce the problem of attributing performance differences between environments to distribution shifts in the underlying data generating mechanisms.

In this paper, by drawing an intrinsic connection between MMCL and asymmetric matrix factorization, we establish the first generalization guarantees of MMCL for visual downstream tasks. Based on this framework, we further unify MMCL and SSCL by showing that MMCL implicitly performs SSCL with (pseudo) positive pairs induced by text pairs. Through this unified perspective, we characterize the advantage of MMCL by showing that text pairs induce more semantically consistent and diverse positive pairs, which, according to our analysis, provably benefit downstream generalization.},

ConCerNet consists of two steps: (i) a contrastive learning method to automatically capture the system invariants (i.e. conservation properties) along the trajectory observations; (ii) a neural projection layer to guarantee that the learned dynamics models preserve the learned invariants. We theoretically prove the functional relationship between the learned latent representation and the unknown system invariant function.

Domain generalization (DG) has become one of the key topics in various fields. Several literatures show that DG can be arbitrarily hard without exploiting target domain information. To address this issue, test-time adaptive (TTA) methods are proposed. Existing TTA methods require offline target data or extra sophisticated optimization procedures during the inference stage. In this work, we adopt Non-Parametric Classifier to perform the test-time Adaptation (AdaNPC). In particular, we construct a memory that contains the feature and label pairs from training domains. During inference, given a test instance, AdaNPC first recalls k closed samples from the memory to vote for the prediction, and then the test feature and predicted label are added to the memory. In this way, the sample distribution in the memory can be gradually changed from the training distribution towards the test distribution with very little extra computation cost.},

To address this limitation, we novelly leverage two causal desiderata, non-spuriousness and efficiency, into rationalization from the causal inference perspective. We formally define a series of probabilities of causation based on a newly proposed structural causal model of rationalization, with its theoretical identification established as the main component of learning necessary and sufficient rationales.},

Recent studies on independent and identically distributed data (e.g., images) have empirically demonstrated that individuals from different groups suffer from different levels of privacy risks to MIAs, i.e., uneven vulnerability. However, theoretical evidence of such uneven vulnerability is missing. In this paper, we first present theoretical evidence of the uneven vulnerability of GNNs to link stealing attacks, which lays the foundation for demystifying such uneven risks among different groups of edges.},

To fully release the value of each modality and mitigate the influence of low-quality multimodal data, dynamic multimodal fusion emerges as a promising learning paradigm. Despite its widespread use, theoretical justifications in this field are still notably lacking. Can we design a provably robust multimodal fusion method? This paper provides theoretical understandings to answer this question under a most popular multimodal fusion framework from the generalization perspective. We proceed to reveal that several uncertainty estimation solutions are naturally available to achieve robust multimodal fusion. Then a novel multimodal fusion framework termed Quality-aware Multimodal Fusion (QMF) is proposed, which can improve the performance in terms of classification accuracy and model robustness. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmarks can support our findings.},

We consider a general online allocation problem with finite types of requests and two-sided resource constraints, and design an efficient online algorithm that achieves a nearly optimal competitive ratio. Our algorithm combines the primal-dual technique and the online learning framework, where we maintain dual variables to guide the allocation decisions. We prove that our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $1-O(\sqrt{(\log m \log T)/T})$ where $m$ is the number of resource types and $T$ is the number of time steps. We also provide a lower bound showing that no online algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio better than $1-\Omega(1/\sqrt{T})$, thus our result is nearly optimal.

We perform an extensive study across six datasets with eight models from three model families. Experimental results show that Coder-Reviewer reranking leads to consistent and significant improvement (up to 17\% absolute accuracy gain) over reranking with the Coder model only. When combined with executability filtering, Coder-Reviewer reranking can often outperform the minimum Bayes risk method.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a continual learning algorithm for fake audio detection to overcome catastrophic forgetting, called Regularized Adaptive Weight Modification (RAWM). When fine-tuning a detection network, our approach adaptively computes the direction of weight modification according to the ratio of genuine utterances and fake utterances. We also exploit the genuine audio similarity to guide the fine-tuning procedure.

  abstract     = {The goal of automated feature generation is to liberate machine learning experts from the laborious task of manual feature generation, which is crucial for improving the learning performance of tabular data. The major challenge in automated feature generation is to efficiently and accurately identify effective features from a vast pool of candidate features. In this paper, we present OpenFE, an automated feature generation tool that provides competitive results against machine learning experts. OpenFE achieves high efficiency and accuracy with two components: 1) a novel feature boosting method for accurately evaluating the incremental performance of candidate features and 2) a two-stage pruning algorithm that performs feature pruning in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets show that OpenFE outperforms existing baseline methods by a large margin. We further evaluate OpenFE in two Kaggle competitions with thousands of data science teams participating. In the two competitions, features generated by OpenFE with a simple baseline model can beat 99.3\% and 99.6\% data science teams respectively. In addition to the empirical results, we provide a theoretical perspective to show that feature generation can be beneficial in a simple yet representative setting.},

  abstract     = {We study reward-free reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation, where the agent works in two phases: (1) in the exploration phase, the agent interacts with the environment but cannot access the reward; and (2) in the planning phase, the agent is given a reward function and is expected to find a near-optimal policy based on samples collected in the exploration phase. The sample complexities of existing reward-free algorithms have a polynomial dependence on the planning horizon, which makes them intractable for long planning horizon RL problems. In this paper, we propose a new reward-free algorithm for learning linear mixture Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the transition probability can be parameterized as a linear combination of known feature mappings. Our algorithm achieves a sample complexity that is independent of the planning horizon for both the exploration and planning phases. To our knowledge, this is the first horizon-free sample complexity bound for reward-free RL with function approximation.},

Based on this new perspective we propose MESH (Minimize Entropy of Sinkhorn): a cross-attention module that combines the tiebreaking properties of unregularized optimal transport with the speed of regularized optimal transport. We evaluate slot attention using MESH on multiple object-centric learning benchmarks and find significant improvements over slot attention in every setting.},

It still suffers the difficulty of mining pixels/patches correspondence between two views. A simple way is inputting the same view twice and aligning the pixel/patch representation. However, it would reduce the variance of inputs, and hurts the performance. We propose a plug-in method PQCL (Positional Query for patch-level Contrastive Learning), which allows performing patch-level contrasts between two views with exact patch correspondence. Besides, by using positional queries, PQCL increases the variance of inputs, to enhance training. We apply PQCL to popular transformer-based CL frameworks (DINO and iBOT), and evaluate them on classification, detection and segmentation tasks, where our method obtains stable improvements, especially for dense tasks.

While existing robust RL methods aim to learn policies robust against deviations of entire system dynamics, this paper proposes the framework of robust situational Markov decision process (RS-MDP) which explicitly captures possible deviations of context transitions.},

Our proposed metrics show that only a few modules are more task-specific and sensitive to task change, while others can be shared across tasks as common knowledge. Hence, we attribute forgetting mainly to the former and find that finetuning them only on a small buffer at the end of any CL method can bring non-trivial improvement.},

At its heart is our improved instance-dependent analysis of the well-known Sequential Halving (SH) algorithm, where we bound the probability of returning an arm whose mean reward is not within $\varepsilon$ from the best (i.e., not $\varepsilon$-good) for any choice of $\varepsilon > 0$, although $\varepsilon$ is not an input to SH. Our bound not only leads to an optimal worst-case simple regret bound of $\sqrt{n/T}$ up to logarithmic factors but also essentially matches the instance-dependent lower bound for returning an $\varepsilon$-good arm.},

Many such models offer free or affordable API access which makes them potentially vulnerable to model extraction attacks through distillation. To protect intellectual property (IP) and make fair use of these models, various techniques such as lexical watermarking and synonym replacement have been proposed. However, these methods can be nullified by obvious countermeasures such as "synonym randomization". To address this issue, we propose GINSW, a novel method to protect text generation models from being stolen through distillation. The key idea of our method is to inject secret signals into the probability vector of the decoding steps for each target token. We can then detect the secret message by probing a suspect model to tell if it is distilled from the protected one. Experimental results show that GINSW can effectively identify instances of IP infringement with minimal impact on the generation quality of protected APIs.},

In this paper we show that, surprisingly, a simple representation learning approach relying only on a latent dynamics model trained by latent temporal consistency is sufficient for high-performance RL. This applies when using pure planning with a dynamics model conditioned on the representation, but also when utilizing the representation as policy and value function features in model-free RL.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of online learning in a two-player decentralized cooperative Stackelberg game. In each round, the leader first takes an action, followed by the follower who takes their action after observing the leader's move. The goal of the leader is to learn to minimize the cumulative regret based on the history of interactions. Differing from the traditional formulation of repeated Stackelberg games, we assume the follower is omniscient, with full knowledge of the true reward, and that they always best-respond to the leader's actions. We analyze the sample complexity of regret minimization in this repeated Stackelberg game. We show that depending on the reward structure, the existence of the omniscient follower may change the sample complexity drastically, from constant to exponential, even for linear cooperative Stackelberg games. This poses unique challenges for the learning process of the leader and the subsequent regret analysis.},

  abstract     = {Diffusion models have exhibited excellent performance in various domains. The probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) of diffusion models (i.e., diffusion ODEs) is a particular case of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs), which enables deterministic inference and exact likelihood evaluation. However, the likelihood estimation results by diffusion ODEs are still far from those of the state-of-the-art likelihood-based generative models. In this work, we propose several improved techniques for maximum likelihood estimation for diffusion ODEs, including both training and evaluation perspectives. For training, we propose velocity parameterization and explore variance reduction techniques for faster convergence. We also derive an error-bounded high-order flow matching objective for finetuning, which improves the ODE likelihood and smooths its trajectory. For evaluation, we propose a novel training-free truncated-normal dequantization to fill the training-evaluation gap commonly existing in diffusion ODEs. Building upon these techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art likelihood estimation results on image datasets (2.56 on CIFAR-10, 3.43/3.69 on ImageNet-32) without variational dequantization or data augmentation.},

In this paper, we propose an evidential interactive learning framework that leverages evidence-based uncertainty estimation and interactive machine learning to improve image captioning with limited labeled data. The interactive learning process involves three stages: keyword prediction, caption generation, and model retraining. First, the model predicts a list of keywords with evidence-based uncertainty and selects the most informative keywords to seek user feedback. Second, user-approved keywords are used as model input to guide the model to generate satisfactory captions.},

During inference, iterative refinement is performed to effectively optimize the generated protein sequences. Experiments show that LM-Design improves the state-of-the-art results by a large margin, leading to 4% to 12% accuracy gains in sequence recovery (e.g., 55.65%/56.63% on CATH 4.2/4.3 single-chain benchmarks, and >60% when designing protein complexes).},

Linear evaluation freezes parameters in the pre-trained model and trains a linear classifier separately, which is efficient and attractive for transfer. However, little work has investigated the classifier in linear evaluation except for the default logistic regression. Inspired by the statistical efficiency of naive Bayes, this paper revisits the classical topic on discriminative vs. generative classifiers. Theoretically, we consider the surrogate loss instead of the zero-one loss in analyses and generalize the classical results from binary cases to multiclass ones. We show that, under mild assumptions, multiclass naive Bayes requires O(log n) samples to approach its asymptotic error while the corresponding multiclass logistic regression requires O(n) samples, where n is the feature dimension. This provides theoretical justification for using generative classifiers in transfer learning scenarios with limited labeled data.},

While graphs with homophily-prone edges tend to connect nodes with the same class (i.e., intra-class nodes), heterophily-prone edges tend to build relationships between nodes with different classes (i.e., inter-class nodes). Existing GNNs only take the original graph during training. The problem with this approach is that it forgets to take into consideration the \"missing-half\" structural information, that is, heterophily-prone topology for homophily-prone graphs and homophily-prone topology for heterophily-prone graphs. In our paper, we introduce Graph cOmplementAry Learning, namely GOAL, which consists of two components: graph complementation and complemented graph convolution. The first component finds the missing-half structural information for a given graph to complement it. The complemented graph has two sets of graphs including both homophily- and heterophily-prone topology. In the latter component, to handle complemented graphs, we design a new graph convolution from the perspective of optimization. The experiment results show that GOAL consistently outperforms all baselines in eight real-world datasets.},

  abstract     = {In deep learning, often the training process finds an interpolator (a solution with 0 training loss), but the test loss is still low. This phenomenon, known as benign overfitting, is a major mystery that received a lot of recent attention. One common mechanism for benign overfitting is implicit regularization, where the training process leads to additional properties for the interpolator, often characterized by minimizing certain norms. However, even for a simple sparse linear regression problem y = β*ᵀx + ξ with sparse β*, neither minimum ℓ₁ or ℓ₂ norm interpolator gives the optimal test loss. In this work, we give a different parametrization of the model which leads to a new implicit regularization effect that combines the benefit of ℓ₁ and ℓ₂ interpolators. We show that training our new model via gradient descent leads to an interpolator with near-optimal test loss. The result is based on careful analysis of the training dynamics and provides another example of implicit regularization effect that goes beyond norm minimization.},

While adhering to the \"spatial interaction + channel evolution\" rule of previous studies, we customize the core designs with Fourier spatial interaction modeling and Fourier channel evolution. Our paradigm, Fourmer, achieves competitive performance on common image restoration tasks such as image de-raining, image enhancement, image dehazing, and guided image super-resolution, while requiring fewer computational resources.},

In this paper, inspired by the cognitive science, we investigate the interference of adversarial noise from the perspective of image phase, and find ordinarily-trained models lack enough robustness against phase-level perturbations. Motivated by this, we propose a joint adversarial defense method: a phase-level adversarial training mechanism to enhance the adversarial robustness on the phase pattern; an amplitude-based pre-processing operation to mitigate the adversarial perturbation in the amplitude pattern. Experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the robust accuracy against multiple attacks and even adaptive attacks. In addition, ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our defense strategy.},

Using this insight, we develop a complex block, named Brainformer, that consists of a diverse set of layers such as sparsely gated feed-forward layers, dense feed-forward layers, attention layers, and various forms of layer normalization and activation functions. Brainformer consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art dense and sparse Transformers, in terms of both quality and efficiency.

  abstract     = {As a type of valuable intellectual property (IP), deep neural network (DNN) models have been protected by techniques like watermarking. However, such passive model protection cannot fully prevent model abuse. In this work, we propose an active model IP protection scheme, namely NNSplitter, which actively protects the model by splitting it into two parts: the obfuscated model that performs poorly due to weight obfuscation, and the model secrets consisting of the indexes and original values of the obfuscated weights, which can only be accessed by authorized users with the support of the trusted execution environment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of NNSplitter, e.g., by only modifying 275 out of over 11 million (i.e., 0.002%) weights, the accuracy of the obfuscated ResNet-18 model on CIFAR-10 can drop to 10%. Moreover, NNSplitter is stealthy and resilient against norm clipping and fine-tuning attacks, making it an appealing solution for DNN model protection.},

In addition to high computational overhead due to explicitly computing hidden states recurrence, existing ODE-based models fall short in learning sequence data with sharp transitions - common in many real-world systems - due to numerical challenges during optimization. In this work, we propose LS4, a generative model for sequences with latent variables evolving according to a state space ODE to increase modeling capacity. Inspired by recent deep state space models (S4), we achieve speedups by leveraging a convolutional representation of LS4 which bypasses the explicit evaluation of hidden states. We show that LS4 significantly outperforms previous continuous-time generative models in terms of marginal distribution, classification, and prediction scores on real-world datasets in the Monash Forecasting Repository, and is capable of modeling highly stochastic data with sharp transitions.},

We first prove an effective regret $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n^{1+\gamma}})$ when suitable parameterized graph kernels are chosen, then propose an approximate algorithm FastONL enjoying $\mathcal{O}(k\sqrt{n^{1+\gamma}})$ regret based on this relaxation. The key of FastONL is a generalized local push method that effectively approximates inverse matrix columns and applies to a series of popular kernels.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous graphs are ubiquitous to model complex data. There are urgent needs on powerful heterogeneous graph neural networks to effectively support important applications. We identify a potential semantic mixing issue in existing message passing processes, where the representations of the neighbors of a node v are forced to be transformed to the feature space of v for aggregation, though the neighbors are in different types. That is, the semantics in different node types are entangled together into node v's representation. To address the issue, we propose SlotGAT with separate message passing processes in slots, one for each node type, to maintain the representations in their own node-type feature spaces. Moreover, in a slot-based message passing layer, we design an attention mechanism for effective slot-wise message aggregation. Further, we develop a slot attention technique after the last layer of SlotGAT, to learn the importance of different slots in downstream tasks. Our analysis indicates that the slots in SlotGAT can preserve different semantics in various feature spaces. The superiority of SlotGAT is evaluated against 13 baselines on 6 datasets for node classification and link prediction.},

The method is then extended to higher-dimensional WL, leading to a novel k,l-WL algorithm, a more general framework than k-WL. We further introduce the subgraph concept into our hierarchy and propose a localized k,l-WL framework, incorporating a wide range of existing work, including many subgraph GNNs. Theoretically, we analyze the expressivity of k,l-WL w.r.t. k and l and compare it with the traditional k-WL. Complexity reduction methods are also systematically discussed to build powerful and practical k,l-GNN instances. We theoretically and experimentally prove that our method is universally compatible and capable of improving the expressivity of any base GNN model. Our k,l-GNNs achieve superior performance on many synthetic and real-world datasets, which verifies the effectiveness of our framework.},

This setting is fairly common in the real world but has been less considered. In this paper, we propose a sequential learning approach under this setting by decoupling a complex system for handling irregularly sampled and cluttered sequential observations. Such decoupling brings about not only subsystems describing the dynamics of each latent entity but also a meta-system capturing the interaction between entities over time. Specifically, we argue that the meta-system evolving within a simplex is governed by projected differential equations (ProjDEs).},

Perhaps surprisingly, a systematic approach to predict precisely how adjusting a specific hyperparameter will affect prunability remains elusive. To address this gap, we introduce a phenomenological model grounded in the statistical mechanics of learning. Our approach uses temperature-like and load-like parameters to model the impact of neural network (NN) training hyperparameters on pruning performance. A key empirical result we identify is a sharp transition phenomenon: depending on the value of a load-like parameter in the pruned model, increasing the value of a temperature-like parameter in the pre-pruned model may either enhance or impair subsequent pruning performance. We build a three-regime model by taxonomizing the global structure of the pruned NN loss landscape. Our model reveals that the dichotomous effect of high temperature is associated with transitions between distinct types of global structures in the post-pruned model. Our new insights lead to new practical approaches of hyperparameter tuning and model selection to improve pruning.},

We show that a range of factors in GNNs can lead to the surprising leakage of private links. Especially by taking GNNs as a Markov chain and attacking GNNs via a flexible chain approximation, we systematically explore the underneath principles of graph reconstruction attack, and propose two information theory-guided mechanisms: (1) the chain-based attack method with adaptive designs for extracting more private information; (2) the chain-based defense method that sharply reduces the attack fidelity with moderate accuracy loss. Such two objectives disclose a critical belief that to recover better in attack, you must extract more multi-aspect knowledge from the trained GNN; while to learn safer for defense, you must forget more link-sensitive information in training GNNs. Empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art results on six datasets and three common GNNs.},

In this work, we present a novel zero-shot object navigation method, Exploration with Soft Commonsense constraints (ESC), that transfers commonsense knowledge in pre-trained models to open-world object navigation without any navigation experience nor any other training on the visual environments. First, ESC leverages a pre-trained vision and language model for open-world prompt-based grounding and a pre-trained commonsense language model for room and object reasoning. Then ESC converts commonsense knowledge into navigation actions by modeling it as soft logic predicates for efficient exploration. Extensive experiments on MP3D, HM3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks show that our ESC method improves significantly over baselines, and achieves new state-of-the-art results for zero-shot object navigation (e.g., 288\% relative Success Rate improvement than CoW on MP3D).},

In this work, we learn unforeseen robustness by harnessing the variations in the abundant out-of-distribution data. To overcome the main challenge of using such data, the domain gap, we use a domain translator to bridge it and bound the unforeseen robustness on the target distribution. As implied by our analysis, we propose a two-step algorithm that first trains an equivariant domain translator to map out-of-distribution data to the target distribution while preserving the considered variation, and then regularizes a model's output consistency on the domain-translated data to improve its robustness. We empirically show the effectiveness of our approach in improving unforeseen and foreseen robustness compared to existing approaches.

In this paper, we dive into the perspective of model dynamics and propose a novel information measure, namely, Memorization Discrepancy, to explore the defense via the model-level information. By implicitly transferring the changes in the data manipulation to that in the model outputs, Memorization Discrepancy can discover the imperceptible poison samples based on their distinct dynamics from the clean samples.

We prove that D-SGD implicitly minimizes the loss function of an average-direction Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) algorithm under general non-convex non-β-smooth settings. This surprising asymptotic equivalence reveals an intrinsic regularization-optimization trade-off and three advantages of decentralization: (1) there exists a free uncertainty evaluation mechanism in D-SGD to improve posterior estimation; (2) D-SGD exhibits a gradient smoothing effect; and (3) the sharpness regularization effect of D-SGD does not decrease as total batch size increases, which justifies the potential generalization benefit of D-SGD over centralized SGD (C-SGD) in large-batch scenarios.},

We show that when the underlying true reward is linear, under both Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model (pairwise comparison) and Plackett-Luce (PL) model (K-wise comparison), MLE converges under certain semi-norm for the family of linear reward. On the other hand, when training a policy based on the learned reward model, we show that MLE fails while a pessimistic MLE provides policies with good performance under certain coverage assumption. We also show that under the PL model, both the true MLE and a different MLE which splits the K-wise comparison into pairwise comparisons converge, while the true MLE is asymptotically more efficient. Our results validate the empirical success of the existing RLHF algorithms, and provide new insights for algorithm design.},

Previous paradigms either explore better scoring functions or utilize the knowledge of outliers to equip the models with the ability of OOD detection. However, few of them pay attention to the intrinsic OOD detection capability of the given model. In this work, we generally discover the existence of an intermediate stage of a model trained on in-distribution (ID) data having higher OOD detection performance than that of its final stage across different settings, and further identify one critical data-level attribution to be learning with the atypical samples. Based on such insights, we propose a novel method, Unleashing Mask, which aims to restore the OOD discriminative capabilities of the well-trained model with ID data. Our method utilizes a mask to figure out the memorized atypical samples, and then finetune the model or prune it with the introduced mask to forget them. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

(3) Additionally, we provide a theoretical guarantee of robustness improvement and investigate how the geodesic location and the sample size contribute, respectively. Experimental validations of the proposed strategy on four datasets including CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, establish the efficacy of our method, e.g., our method improves the baselines' certifiable robustness on CIFAR10 upto 7.7%, with 16.8% on empirical robustness on CIFAR-100.

On the other hand, continuous-time methods have recently gained attraction, especially in the context of irregularly-sampled time series, where they can better handle the data than discrete-time methods. One such class are Gaussian process variational autoencoders (GPVAEs), where the VAE prior is set as a Gaussian process (GP). However, a major limitation of GPVAEs is that it inherits the cubic computational cost as GPs, making it unattractive to practitioners. We leverage the equivalent discrete state space representation of Markovian GPs to enable linear time GPVAE training via Kalman filtering and smoothing. This method performs favourably compared to existing approaches whilst being computationally highly scalable.},

We address the challenge of inconsistent column types and quantities among tables by utilizing independent featurizers and using federated learning to pretrain the shared component. Tested on 84 tabular prediction tasks from the {OpenML}-{AutoML} Benchmark ({AMLB}), we show that (1) {XTab} consistently boosts the generalizability, learning speed, and performance of multiple tabular transformers, (2) by pretraining {FT}-Transformer via {XTab}, we achieve superior performance than other state-of-the-art tabular deep learning models on various tasks such as regression, binary, and multiclass classification.},

The paper addresses a neglected yet non-negligible computational challenge of {MIL} in the context of {DAM}, i.e., bag size is too large to be loaded into {GPU} memory for backpropagation, which is required by the standard pooling methods of {MIL}. To tackle this challenge, they propose variance-reduced stochastic pooling methods in the spirit of stochastic optimization by formulating the loss function over the pooled prediction as a multi-level compositional function. By synthesizing techniques from stochastic compositional optimization and non-convex min-max optimization, they propose a unified and provable multi-instance {DAM} ({MIDAM}) algorithm with stochastic smoothed-max pooling or stochastic attention-based pooling, which only samples a few instances for each bag to compute a stochastic gradient estimator and to update the model parameter. They establish a similar convergence rate of the proposed {MIDAM} algorithm as the state-of-the-art {DAM} algorithms. Their extensive experiments on conventional {MIL} datasets and medical datasets demonstrate the superiority of their {MIDAM} algorithm.},

The go-to approach that the industry frequently adopts is using off-the-shelf proxy models to predict the missing sensitive attributes, e.g. Meta [Alao et al., 2021] and Twitter [Belli et al., 2022]. Despite its popularity, there are three important questions unanswered: (1) Is directly using proxies efficacious in measuring fairness? (2) If not, is it possible to accurately evaluate fairness using proxies only? (3) Given the ethical controversy over inferring user private information, is it possible to only use weak (i.e. inaccurate) proxies in order to protect privacy? Our theoretical analyses show that directly using proxy models can give a false sense of (un)fairness. Second, we develop an algorithm that is able to measure fairness (provably) accurately with only three properly identified proxies. Third, we show that our algorithm allows the use of only weak proxies (e.g. with only 68.85\% accuracy on {COMPAS}), adding an extra layer of protection on user privacy. Experiments validate our theoretical analyses and show our algorithm can effectively measure and mitigate bias.},

Our contributions include: (1) we study both consistency and robustness by establishing top-k (∀ k≥ 1) consistency of {LDR} losses for multi-class classification, and a negative result that a top-1 consistent and symmetric robust loss cannot achieve top-k consistency simultaneously for all k≥ 2; (2) we propose a new adaptive {LDR} loss that automatically adapts the individualized temperature parameter to the noise degree of class label of each instance; (3) we demonstrate stable and competitive performance for the proposed adaptive {LDR} loss on 7 benchmark datasets under 6 noisy label and 1 clean settings against 13 loss functions, and on one real-world noisy dataset.},

Likelihood-based inference for mixture distributions often involves non-convex and high-dimensional objective functions, imposing difficult computational and statistical challenges. The classic expectation-maximization ({EM}) algorithm is a computationally thrifty iterative method that maximizes a surrogate function minorizing the log-likelihood of observed data in each iteration, which however suffers from bad local maxima even in the special case of the standard Gaussian mixture model with common isotropic covariance matrices. In this work, we develop likelihood adjusted semidefinite programs ({LSDPs}) for clustering, which integrate likelihood-based objectives with convex semidefinite relaxation. Through a careful analysis of the semidefinite relaxation, we establish sufficient conditions under which the proposed method exactly recovers the ground truth cluster assignment. Our approach enjoys global optimality and can handle general non-convex clustering objectives. Extensive experiments on simulated and real data show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in challenging settings.},

We find that data-driven learners of decompositions can be easily misled towards local decompositions that do not hold globally across the search space. Then, we formally show that a random tree-based decomposition sampler exhibits favourable theoretical guarantees that effectively trade off maximal information gain and functional mismatch between the actual black-box and its surrogate as provided by the decomposition. We propose the random decomposition upper-confidence bound algorithm ({RDUCB}) that is straightforward to implement - (almost) plug-and-play - and, surprisingly, yields significant empirical gains compared to the previous state-of-the-art on a comprehensive set of benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {{Mixup}, a simple data augmentation method that randomly mixes two data points via linear interpolation, has been extensively applied in various deep learning applications to gain better generalization. However, the theoretical underpinnings of its efficacy are not yet fully understood. In this paper, we aim to seek a fundamental understanding of the benefits of {Mixup}. We first show that {Mixup} using different linear interpolation parameters for features and labels can still achieve similar performance to the standard {Mixup}. This indicates that the intuitive linearity explanation in Zhang et al., (2018) may not fully explain the success of {Mixup}. Then we perform a theoretical study of {Mixup} from the feature learning perspective. We consider a feature-noise data model and show that {Mixup} training can effectively learn the rare features (appearing in a small fraction of data) from its mixture with the common features (appearing in a large fraction of data). In contrast, standard training can only learn the common features but fails to learn the rare features, thus suffering from bad generalization performance. Moreover, our theoretical analysis also shows that the benefits of {Mixup} for feature learning are mostly gained in the early training phase, based on which we propose to apply early stopping in {Mixup}. Experimental results verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the early-stopped {Mixup} training.},
