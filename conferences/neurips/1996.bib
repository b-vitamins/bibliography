@inproceedings{peper1996hebb,
 abstract = {This paper investigates the stationary points of a Hebb learning rule with a sigmoid nonlinearity. When input has low information content, this learning rule suppresses learning, forcing the weight vector to converge to zero. When information content exceeds a certain value, the rule begins to learn a feature in the input. Under certain conditions, the first principal component may be learned, and the weight vector length remains bounded if input variance is finite. Simulations confirmed the theoretical results.},

 abstract = {Given a multidimensional data set and a model of its density, we consider how to define the optimal interpolation between two points. This is done by assigning a cost to each path through space, based on two competing goals-one to interpolate through regions of high density, the other to minimize arc length. From this path functional, we derive the Euler-Lagrange equations for extremal motion; given two points, the desired interpolation is found by solving a boundary value problem.},
