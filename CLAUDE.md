# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal bibliography management system storing BibTeX entries organized by research domain and format. The repository contains Python scripts for verifying, cleaning, and manipulating BibTeX files.

## Common Commands

### Verify BibTeX Files
```bash
python3 scripts/verify-bib.py by-domain/*.bib
python3 scripts/verify-bib.py by-format/**/*.bib
```

### Clean BibTeX Files
```bash
# Clean a single file (creates .bib.clean output)
python3 scripts/clean-bib.py by-domain/transformers.bib

# Clean in-place with backup
python3 scripts/clean-bib.py --in-place by-domain/transformers.bib

# Clean without backup
python3 scripts/clean-bib.py --no-backup --in-place by-domain/*.bib
```

### Count Entries
```bash
python3 scripts/count-entries.py by-domain/llm.bib
```

### Extract Individual Entries
```bash
# Creates tmp/filename/entry-N.bib files
python3 scripts/extract-entries.py by-domain/transformers.bib
```

### Compare BibTeX Files
```bash
# Find missing entries between original and enriched versions
python3 scripts/compare-bib-files.py by-format/references/award.bib by-format/references/award.bib.enriched
```

## Repository Structure

The bibliography is organized into three main directories:

- **by-domain/**: BibTeX files categorized by research domain (ML theory, transformers, LLMs, etc.)
- **by-format/**: BibTeX files organized by publication format (papers, theses, courses, presentations)
- **meta/**: Working and test BibTeX files

Python utilities in **scripts/** handle BibTeX file operations without requiring external package management. All scripts use bibtexparser and standard library modules.

## Development Notes

- Scripts use UTF-8 encoding and handle control characters, EOF markers, and shell artifacts
- The clean-bib.py script creates backup files by default before modifications
- Entry extraction creates temporary directories under tmp/ which should be cleaned periodically
- All scripts follow Unix conventions with clear error messages and exit codes
