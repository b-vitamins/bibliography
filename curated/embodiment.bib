  abstract = {Soft robots are often inspired from biological systems which consist of soft materials or are actuated by electrically activated materials. There are several advantages of soft robots compared to the conventional robots; safe human-machine interaction, adaptability to wearable devices, simple gripping system, and so on. Due to the unique features and advantages, soft robots have a considerable range of applications. This article reviews state-of-the-art researches on soft robots and application areas. Actuation systems for soft robots can be categorized and analyzed into three types: variable length tendon, fluidic actuation, and electro-active polymer systems.},

Natural systems, however, often match or exceed the performance of robotic systems with deformable bodies. Cephalopods, for example, achieve amazing feats of manipulation and locomotion without a skeleton; even vertebrates such as humans achieve dynamic gaits by storing elastic energy in their compliant bones and soft tissues. Inspired by nature, engineers have begun to explore the design and control of soft-bodied robots composed of compliant materials.

@article{strgar2025accelerated,
  abstract = {The co-design of robot morphology and neural control typically requires using reinforcement learning to approximate a unique control policy gradient for each body plan, demanding massive amounts of training data to measure the performance of each design. We show that a universal, morphology-agnostic controller can be rapidly and directly obtained by gradient-based optimization through differentiable simulation. This process of morphological pretraining allows the designer to explore non-differentiable changes to a robot's physical layout (e.g., adding, removing and recombining discrete body parts) and immediately determine which revisions are beneficial and which are deleterious using the pretrained model. We demonstrate this approach by conducting what we call zero-shot evolution and compare it with the simultaneous co-optimization of a universal controller alongside an evolving design population.},

Electroactive polymers (EAP) offer an effective alternative to current actuators. Two families of EAP materials are being investigated: bending ionomers and longitudinal electrostatically driven elastomers. These materials were demonstrated to effectively actuate manipulation devices. Bending-EAP operation was observed at conditions that exceed the harsh environment on Mars. An effective coating technique using sprayed polymer was developed, extending EAP operation in air from a few minutes to about four months by forming the equivalent of a skin to protect the moisture content of the ionomer. The team constructed an EAP-driven miniature robotic arm controlled by MATLAB code to drop and lift the arm and close and open EAP fingers of a 4-finger gripper.},

We propose that reducing interface stiffness offers advantages including greater shock tolerance, lower reflected inertia, more accurate and stable force control, less inadvertent damage to the environment, and the capacity for energy storage. Series elastic actuators place linear springs intentionally in series between the motor and actuator output, where spring strain is measured to get an accurate estimate of force. The control system servos the motor to reduce the difference between the desired force and the measured force signal.

This work proposes ExBody, a method for whole-body control of humanoid robots that can generate rich, diverse, and expressive motions. The key insight is to train a policy that can track reference motions from large-scale human motion capture datasets using reinforcement learning. However, directly training on motion capture data presents challenges due to the mismatch between human and robot morphology and physical capabilities. ExBody addresses this by encouraging the upper body to imitate the reference motion while allowing the legs to deviate to maintain stability and follow velocity commands. Through training in simulation and sim-to-real transfer, the resulting policy enables a humanoid robot to walk in different styles, shake hands with humans, and even dance in the real world.},

For example, navigation relies on root velocity tracking, while tabletop manipulation prioritizes upper-body joint angle tracking. Existing approaches typically train individual policies tailored to a specific command space, limiting their transferability across modes. The key insight is that full-body kinematic motion imitation can serve as a common abstraction for all these tasks and provide general-purpose motor skills for learning multiple modes of whole-body control. We present HOVER (Humanoid Versatile Controller), a multi-mode policy distillation framework that consolidates diverse control modes into a unified policy.

Discrete-time filters and smoothers have historically been the dominant approach. However, the paradigm of continuous-time state estimation proposes an alternative strategy by estimating variables that express the state as a continuous function of time, which can be evaluated at any query time. This approach not only benefits downstream tasks such as planning and control, but also significantly increases estimator performance and flexibility, as well as reduces sensor preprocessing and interfacing complexity. Despite their advantages, continuous-time methods remain underutilized, potentially because they are less well-known within robotics. This work presents a unifying formulation of these methods and the most exhaustive literature review to date.},

Here, we introduce a discrete hybrid automata framework to online reinforcement learning for switching among different modes. In our framework, we decouple the identification and control of hybrid systems by introducing a Multi-critic architecture, where each critic targets one mode, and the mode-switching is determined by a beta distribution. To validate our approach, we focus on underactuated quadruped robot skateboarding, which requires coordination of stance and flight phases. The robot successfully learns to skateboard in simulation and demonstrates Sim2Real transfer, validating our hybrid learning approach for complex dynamic tasks.},

Our approach leverages the in-context learning capability of large language models to dynamically generate socially appropriate gesture motion sequences for human-robot interaction. We conducted comprehensive user studies with 24 participants, evaluating both the naturalness and understandability of the generated motions. Our results demonstrate that motions generated using our framework are perceived as more natural and understandable compared to baseline methods. Additionally, we show that our approach can generate diverse motion sequences and adapt to different social contexts and user preferences.},

  abstract = {Humanoid robots hold great potential to perform various human-level skills, involving unified locomotion and manipulation in real-world settings. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in humanoid locomotion and manipulation (HLM), focusing on control, planning, and learning methods. We review model-based methods that have been the backbone of humanoid robotics for the past three decades, and examine emerging learning-based methods, with emphasis on reinforcement and imitation learning that enhance the robustness and versatility of loco-manipulation skills. We also assess the potential of integrating foundation models with humanoid embodiments and highlight the emerging role of tactile sensing as a crucial modality for contact-rich interactions.},

  abstract = {The Fourth Symposium on Machine Learning and Dynamical Systems brought together researchers to explore two main directions: (1) Machine Learning for Dynamical Systems - analyzing dynamical systems based on observed data rather than analytical methods, and (2) Dynamical Systems for Machine Learning - analyzing machine learning algorithms using tools from dynamical systems theory. Applications addressed include computer vision, stock market analysis, speech recognition, recommender systems and sentiment analysis in social media.},
