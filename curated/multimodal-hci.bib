  abstract = {As AI tools proliferate across domains, from chatbots and copilots to emerging agents, they increasingly support professional knowledge work. Yet despite their growing capabilities, these systems remain fragmented: they assist with isolated tasks but lack the architectural scaffolding for sustained, adaptive collaboration. We propose a layered framework for human-agent systems that integrates three interdependent dimensions: interaction, process, and infrastructure. Crucially, our architecture elevates process to a primary focus by making it explicit, inspectable, and adaptable, enabling humans and agents to align with evolving goals and coordinate over time. This model clarifies limitations of current tools, unifies emerging system design approaches, and reveals new opportunities for researchers and AI system builders.},

  abstract = {Nonverbal communication is integral to human interaction, with gestures, facial expressions, and body language conveying critical aspects of intent and emotion. However, existing large language models (LLMs) fail to effectively incorporate these nonverbal elements, limiting their capacity to create fully immersive conversational experiences. To address this gap, we introduce MARS, a multimodal language model designed to understand and generate nonverbal cues alongside text. Our key contribution is VENUS, a large-scale dataset comprising annotated videos with time-aligned text, facial expressions, and body language. We train MARS with a next-token prediction objective, combining text with vector-quantized nonverbal representations to achieve multimodal understanding and generation within a unified framework. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate MARS's effectiveness in both understanding and generating appropriate nonverbal behaviors in conversational contexts.},

Previous research has demonstrated that gestures dynamically entrain each other and that speakers tend to align their vocal properties. While gesture and speech are known to synchronize at the intrapersonal level, few studies have investigated the multimodal dynamics of gesture/speech between individuals. Here, we investigated both the intrapersonal and interpersonal multimodal dynamics between speech and gesture during unstructured conversation. Using an online dataset of 14 dyads engaged in unstructured conversation, we measured speech and gesture synchronization using cross-wavelets at different timescales. Results confirm previous research on intrapersonal speech/gesture coordination, finding synchronization at all timescales of conversation, and extend the literature by also finding interpersonal synchronization between speech and gesture. Importantly, vocal and movement synchronization occurs particularly at middle and slower timescales between 2 and 30 seconds.},

Currently, it entails game creators to integrate heterogeneous virtual and physical components, which is often time-consuming and labor-intensive, without the support of a coherent technology stack. The underlying technodiversity manifested by the research corpus suggests a complicated, multi-dimensional design space that goes beyond merely technical concerns. In this research, we adopted a research-through-design approach and proposed an MR game technology stack that facilitates flexible, low-code game development. As design grounding, we first surveyed 34 state-of-the-art studies, and results were synergized into three different spectra of technological affordances, respectively activity range, user interface and feedback control, to inform our next design process. We went through an iterative prototyping phase and implemented an MR game development toolset. A co-design workshop was conducted, where we invited 15 participants to try the prototype tools and co-ideate the potential use scenarios for the proposed technology stack. As a result, four conceptual game designs with three major design implications were generated, which conjointly reflect a broader understanding on MR gameful experience and contribute fresh insights to this emerging research domain.},

  abstract = {This document presents a systematic review of Multimodal Human--Computer Interaction. It shows how different types of interaction technologies (virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality, force and vibration feedback devices (haptics), and tracking) are used in different domains (concepts, medicine, physics, human factors/user experience design, transportation, cultural heritage, and industry). An initial literature search identified 406 articles, from which 112 research works were selected for in-depth analysis. The analysis was conducted from three perspectives: temporal patterns, frequency of technology usage across domains, and cluster analysis. The findings show that VR and haptics are the most widely used technologies across domains. While VR is the most used technology, haptic interaction is increasingly appearing in applications. The review suggests that future work could focus on combining VR and haptic technologies to enhance multimodal human--computer interaction experiences.},

@inproceedings{jia2020multimodal,
  abstract = {We present a multimodal human-computer interaction system called MMISE (Multimodal Interaction System for Education) that comprehensively uses various input and output channels. For input, it includes traditional keyboard typing, mouse clicking, screen touching, as well as the latest speech and face recognition technology. For output, it uses traditional screen display along with speech synthesis, facial expression synthesis, and gesture generation. The system employs a pedagogical objective-oriented mechanism (POOOIIM) where input and output channels are determined by specific educational objectives, designed to enhance learning through more interactive and adaptive interfaces. We describe the system's architecture and working mechanism, illustrated with practical examples. The system was pilot tested during the COVID-19 pandemic for online learning applications, helping maintain student engagement in remote learning environments through natural human-computer interaction capabilities.},

@inproceedings{jiang2018inferring,
  abstract = {Motivated by the desire to give vehicles better information about their drivers, we explore human intent inference in the setting of a human driver riding in a moving vehicle. Specifically, we consider scenarios where the driver intends to go to or learn about a specific point of interest along the vehicle's route, and an autonomous system infers this using gaze cues. The key challenge is that the scene under observation is highly dynamic---both the background and objects in the scene move independently relative to the driver---making these scenarios significantly different from the static scenes considered by most literature in the eye tracking community. We provide a formulation for determining a point of interest in a dynamic scenario, design an experimental framework to systematically evaluate initial solutions, and propose our own solution called dynamic interest point detection (DIPD). We experimentally demonstrate the success of DIPD when compared to baseline nearest-neighbor or filtering approaches.},

@article{hasler2017realtime,
  abstract = {Nonverbal behavior plays a crucial role in human communication and often leads to misunderstandings between people from different cultures, even if they speak the same language fluently. While translation systems are available for verbal communication, translators for nonverbal communication do not exist yet. The authors present the conceptual design and an early prototype of a real-time gesture translator using body tracking and gesture recognition in avatar-mediated intercultural interactions. It contributes to the ambitious goal of bridging between cultures by translating culture-specific gestures to enhance mutual understanding. Possible applications of the gesture translator are discussed as a facilitating tool for global business meetings and as a means of technology-enhanced conflict resolution and prevention.},

  abstract = {The grand challenge of multimodal interface creation is to build reliable processing systems able to analyze and understand multiple communication means in real-time. This opens a number of associated issues covered by this chapter, such as heterogeneous data types fusion, architectures for real-time processing, dialog management, machine learning for multimodal interaction, modeling languages, frameworks, etc. The chapter does not intend to cover exhaustively all the issues related to multimodal interfaces creation and some hot topics, such as error handling, have been left aside. The chapter starts with the features and advantages associated with multimodal interaction, with a focus on particular findings and guidelines, as well as cognitive foundations underlying multimodal interaction. The chapter then focuses on the driving theoretical principles, time-sensitive software architectures and multimodal fusion and fission issues.},
