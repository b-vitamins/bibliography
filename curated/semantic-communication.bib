  abstract = {We define the relevant information in a signal $xın X$ as being the information that this signal provides about another signal $yın Y$. Examples include the information that face images provide about the names of the people portrayed, or the information that speech sounds provide about the words spoken. Understanding the signal $x$ requires more than just predicting $y$, it also requires specifying which features of $X$ play a role in the prediction. We formalize this problem as that of finding a short code for $X$ that preserves the maximum information about $Y$. That is, we squeeze the information that $X$ provides about $Y$ through a 'bottleneck' formed by a limited set of codewords $\tildeX$. This constrained optimization problem can be seen as a generalization of rate distortion theory in which the distortion measure $d(x,\tildex)$ emerges from the joint statistics of $X$ and $Y$. This approach yields an exact set of self consistent equations for the coding rules $X \to \tildeX$ and $\tildeX \to Y$. Solutions to these equations can be found by a convergent re-estimation method that generalizes the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm.},

  abstract = {Wireless connectivity has traditionally been regarded as an opaque data pipe carrying messages, whose context-dependent meaning and effectiveness have been ignored. Nevertheless, in emerging cyber-physical and autonomous networked systems, acquiring, processing, and sending excessive amounts of distributed real-time data, which ends up being stale or useless to the end user, will cause communication bottlenecks, increased latency, and safety issues. We envision a communication paradigm shift, which makes the Semantics of Information, i.e., the significance and the usefulness of messages with respect to the goal of data exchange, the underpinning of the entire communication process. This entails a goal-oriented unification of information generation, transmission, and usage, by taking into account process dynamics, signal sparsity, data correlation, and semantic information attributes. We apply this structurally new, synergetic approach to a communication scenario where the destination is tasked with real-time source reconstruction for the purpose of remote actuation. Capitalizing on semantics-empowered sampling and communication policies, we show significant reduction in both reconstruction error and cost of actuation error, as well as in the number of uninformative samples generated.},

Powered by deep learning, natural language processing (NLP) has achieved great success in analyzing and understanding large amounts of language texts. Inspired by research results in both areas, we aim at providing a new view on communication systems from the semantic level. Particularly, we propose a deep learning based semantic communication system, named DeepSC, for text transmission. Based on the Transformer, the DeepSC aims at maximizing the system capacity and minimizing the semantic errors by recovering the meaning of sentences, rather than bit- or symbol-errors in traditional communications. Moreover, transfer learning is used to ensure the DeepSC applicable to different communication environments and to accelerate the model training process. To justify the performance of semantic communications accurately, we also initialize a new metric, named sentence similarity. Compared with the traditional communication system without considering semantic information exchange, the proposed DeepSC is more robust to channel variation and is able to achieve better performance, especially in the low signal-to-noise (SNR) regime, as demonstrated by the extensive simulation results.},

We parameterize the encoder and decoder functions by two convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are trained jointly, and can be considered as an autoencoder with a non-trainable layer in the middle that represents the noisy communication channel. Our results show that the proposed deep JSCC scheme outperforms digital transmission concatenating JPEG or JPEG2000 compression with a capacity achieving channel code at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and channel bandwidth values in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). More strikingly, deep JSCC does not suffer from the 'cliff effect', and it provides a graceful performance degradation as the channel SNR varies with respect to the SNR value assumed during training. In the case of a slow Rayleigh fading channel, deep JSCC learns noise resilient coded representations and significantly outperforms separation-based digital communication at all SNR and channel bandwidth values.},

Recently, the deep learning community has found that features of the VGG network trained on ImageNet classification have been remarkably useful as a training loss for image synthesis. But how perceptual are these so-called 'perceptual losses'? What elements are critical for their success? To answer these questions, we introduce a new dataset of human perceptual similarity judgments.

Three popular SemCom systems enabled by classical GAI models are first introduced, including variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. For each system, the fundamental concept of the GAI model, the corresponding SemCom architecture, and the associated literature review of recent efforts are elucidated. Then, a novel generative SemCom system is proposed by incorporating the cutting-edge GAI technology-large language models (LLMs). This system features two LLM-based AI agents at both the transmitter and receiver, serving as "brains" to enable powerful information understanding and content regeneration capabilities, respectively. This innovative design allows the receiver to directly generate the desired content, instead of recovering the bit stream, based on the coded semantic information conveyed by the transmitter. Therefore, it shifts the communication mindset from "information recovery" to "information regeneration" and thus ushers in a new era of generative SemCom.},

@article{ari2024goaloriented,
  abstract = {We study a setting where an intelligent model (e.g., a pre-trained neural network) predicts the real-time value of a target signal using data samples transmitted from a remote source according to a scheduling policy. The scheduler decides on i) the age of the samples to be sent, ii) when to send them, and iii) the length of each packet (i.e., the number of samples contained in each packet). The dependence of inference quality on the Age of Information (AoI) for a given packet length is modeled by a general relationship. Previous work assumed i.i.d. transmission delays with immediate feedback or were restricted to the case where inference performance degrades as the input data ages. Our formulation, in addition to capturing non-monotone age dependence, also covers Markovian delay on both forward and feedback links. We model this as an infinite-horizon average-cost Semi-Markov Decision Process.},

@article{agheli2024integrated,
  abstract = {This paper studies decision-making for goal-oriented effective communication. We consider an end-to-end status update system where a sensing agent (SA) observes a source, generates and transmits updates to an actuation agent (AA), while the AA takes actions to accomplish a goal at the endpoint. We integrate the push- and pull-based update communication models to obtain a push-and-pull model, which allows the transmission controller at the SA to decide to push an update to the AA and the query controller at the AA to pull updates by raising queries at specific time instances. To gauge effectiveness, we utilize a grade of effectiveness (GoE) metric incorporating updates' freshness, usefulness, and timeliness of actions as qualitative attributes. We then derive effect-aware policies to maximize the expected discounted sum of updates' effectiveness subject to induced costs. The effect-aware policy at the SA considers the potential effectiveness of communicated updates at the endpoint, while at the AA, it accounts for the probabilistic evolution of the source and importance of generated updates.},

@inproceedings{pomponi2024goaloriented,
  abstract = {This paper presents a novel framework for goal-oriented semantic communications leveraging recursive early exit models. The proposed approach is built on two key components. First, we introduce an innovative early exit strategy that dynamically partitions computations, enabling samples to be offloaded to a server based on layer-wise recursive prediction dynamics that detect samples for which the confidence is not increasing fast enough over layers. Second, we develop a Reinforcement Learning-based online optimization framework that jointly determines early exit points, computation splitting, and offloading strategies, while accounting for wireless conditions, inference accuracy, and resource costs. Numerical evaluations in an edge inference scenario demonstrate the method's adaptability and effectiveness in striking an excellent trade-off between performance, latency, and resource efficiency.},

@article{guo2024knowledge,
  abstract = {With the development of artificial intelligence and computer hardware, semantic communication has been attracting great interest. As an emerging communication paradigm, semantic communication can reduce the requirement for channel bandwidth by extracting semantic information. This is an effective method that can be applied to image acquisition of unmanned aerial vehicles, which can transmit high-data-volume images within the constraints of limited available bandwidth. However, the existing semantic communication schemes fail to adequately incorporate the guidance of task requirements into the semantic communication process and are difficult to adapt to the dynamic changes of tasks. A task-oriented image semantic communication scheme driven by knowledge base is proposed, aiming at achieving high compression ratio and high quality image reconstruction, and effectively solving the bandwidth limitation. This scheme segments the input image into several semantic information unit under the guidance of task requirements by Yolo-World and Segment Anything Model. The assigned bandwidth for each unit is according to the task relevance scores, which enables high-quality transmission of task-related information with lower communication overheads. An improved metric weighted learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) is proposed to evaluate the transmission accuracy of the novel scheme. Experimental results show that our scheme achieves a notable performance improvement on weighted LPIPS while the same compression ratio compared with traditional image compression schemes. Our scheme has a higher target capture ratio than traditional image compression schemes under the task of target detection.},

By leveraging the Koopman operator in an autoencoder (AE) framework, the system's state evolution is linearized in the latent space using a dynamic semantic Koopman (DSK) model, capturing the baseline semantic dynamics. Signal temporal logic (STL) is incorporated through a logical semantic Koopman (LSK) model to encode system-specific control rules. These models form the proposed logical Koopman AE framework that reduces communication costs while improving state prediction accuracy and control performance, showing a 91.65% reduction in communication samples and significant performance gains in simulation.},
