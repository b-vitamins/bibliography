  abstract = {Today's data centers may contain tens of thousands of computers with significant aggregate bandwidth requirements. The network architecture typically consists of a tree of routing and switching elements with progressively more specialized and expensive equipment moving up the network hierarchy. Unfortunately, even when deploying the highest-end IP switches/routers, resulting topologies may only support 50% of the aggregate bandwidth available at the edge of the network, while still incurring tremendous cost. Non-uniform bandwidth among data center nodes complicates application design and limits overall system performance. In this paper, we show how to leverage largely commodity Ethernet switches to support the full aggregate bandwidth of clusters consisting of tens of thousands of elements. Similar to how clusters of commodity computers have largely replaced more specialized SMPs and MPPs, we argue that appropriately architected and interconnected commodity switches may deliver more performance at less cost than available from today's higher-end solutions. Our approach requires no modifications to the end host network interface, operating system, or applications; critically, it is fully backward compatible with Ethernet, IP, and TCP.},

  abstract = {Modern RDMA hardware offers the potential for exceptional performance, but design choices including which RDMA operations to use and how to use them significantly affect observed performance. This paper lays out guidelines that can be used by system designers to navigate the RDMA design space. The guidelines emphasize paying attention to low-level details such as individual PCIe transactions and NIC architecture. We empirically demonstrate how these guidelines can be used to improve the performance of RDMA-based systems: we design a networked sequencer that outperforms an existing design by 50x, and improve the CPU efficiency of a prior high-performance key-value store by 83%. We also present and evaluate several new RDMA optimizations and pitfalls, and discuss how they affect the design of RDMA systems.},

@article{liu2003high,
  abstract = {InfiniBand Architecture is relatively new in the high performance computing area, but it offers many features which help improve the performance of communication subsystems. One of these features is Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) operations. In this paper, we propose a new design of MPI over InfiniBand which brings the benefit of RDMA to not only large messages, but also small and control messages. We also achieve better scalability by exploiting application communication pattern and combining send/receive operations with RDMA operations. Our RDMA-based MPI implementation achieves a latency of 6.8 Î¼sec for small messages and a peak bandwidth of 871 million bytes/sec. For small messages, our RDMA-based design can reduce the latency by 24%, increase the bandwidth by over 104%, and reduce the host overhead by up to 22%. For large messages, we improve performance by reducing the time for transferring control messages.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm by which a process in a distributed system determines a global state of the system during a computation. Many problems in distributed systems can be cast in terms of the problem of detecting global states. For instance, the global state detection algorithm helps to solve an important class of problems: stable property detection. A stable property is one that persists: once a stable property becomes true it remains true thereafter. Examples of stable properties are ``computation has terminated,'' ``the system is deadlocked'' and ``all tokens in a token ring have disappeared.'' The algorithm is illustrated by solving a classical problem in distributed systems: the termination detection problem. The authors assume that messages are delivered in the order sent and that the communication graph is strongly connected.},

It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems. In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majorities to guarantee safety.},

Our algorithm represents a scene using a fully-connected (non-convolutional) deep network, whose input is a single continuous 5D coordinate (spatial location (x,y,z) and viewing direction) and whose output is the volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance at that spatial location. We synthesize views by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and use classic volume rendering techniques to project the output colors and densities into an image. Because volume rendering is naturally differentiable, the only input required to optimize our representation is a set of images with known camera poses.},

  abstract = {Radiance Field methods have recently revolutionized novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multiple photos or videos. However, achieving high visual quality still requires neural networks that are costly to train and render, while recent faster methods inevitably trade off speed for quality. For unbounded and complete scenes (rather than isolated objects) and 1080p resolution rendering, no current method can achieve real-time display rates. We introduce three key elements that allow us to achieve state-of-the-art visual quality while maintaining competitive training times and importantly allow high-quality real-time (â¥ 30 fps) novel-view synthesis at 1080p resolution: 1) Starting from sparse points produced during camera calibration, we represent the scene with 3D Gaussians that preserve desirable properties of continuous volumetric radiance fields for scene optimization while avoiding unnecessary computation in empty space; 2) We perform interleaved optimization/density control of the 3D Gaussians, notably optimizing anisotropic covariance to achieve an accurate representation of the scene; 3) We develop a fast visibility-aware rendering algorithm that supports anisotropic splatting and both accelerates training and allows realtime rendering.},

Training leverages recent advances in text-to-speech and speech enhancement, which combine adversarial and reconstruction losses to allow the generation of high-quality audio content from quantized embeddings. By training with structured dropout applied to quantizer layers, a single model can operate across variable bitrates from 3kbps to 18kbps, with a negligible quality loss when compared with models trained at fixed bitrates. In addition, the model is amenable to a low latency implementation, which supports streamable inference and runs in real time on a smartphone CPU. In subjective evaluations using audio at 24kHz sampling rate, SoundStream at 3kbps outperforms Opus at 12kbps and approaches EVS at 9.6kbps.},

We also tackle three concrete challenges: (1) Information propagation through neural networks: studying input-output maps for different architectures, including universal embedding properties for neural ODEs and classification of multilayer perceptrons. (2) Neural network training dynamics: examining gradient descent from a dynamical systems perspective, exploring stability in overdetermined and overparameterized settings, and investigating the "edge of stability" phenomenon. (3) Mean-field limits of neural networks: extending techniques to heterogeneous neural networks using graph limits and demonstrating how neural networks relate to Kuramoto-type models. Finally, we suggest that similar dynamical approaches could be applied to generative models and fundamental gradient training issues like backpropagation and gradient instability.},

These algorithms employ set recursion, ensuring termination after a finite number of iterations and generating subsets in which closed-loop dynamics are forward invariant, thus guaranteeing perpetual operational safety. Additionally, the authors propose model predictive control designs that integrate these control invariant sets into mixed-integer optimization, with guaranteed adherence to safety constraints and recursive feasibility at the computational level. The paper includes a comprehensive theoretical analysis examining the properties and guarantees of the proposed methods. Numerical simulations in an autonomous driving scenario demonstrate the methods' effectiveness in synthesizing control-invariant sets offline and implementing model predictive control online, ensuring safety and recursive feasibility.},

At the heart of efficient cloud operations are job scheduling and resource management, which are critical for optimizing system performance and ensuring timely and cost-effective service delivery. However, the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of cloud environments presents significant challenges for these tasks, as workloads and resource availability can fluctuate unpredictably. Traditional approaches, including heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms, often struggle to adapt to these real-time changes due to their reliance on static models or predefined rules. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising solution to these challenges by enabling systems to learn and adapt policies based on continuous observations of the environment, facilitating intelligent and responsive decision-making. This work bridges the gap by systematically analyzing DRL in job scheduling and resource management from an algorithm-level perspective, providing a structured examination of advancements and methodologies.},

  abstract = {Efficient resource allocation is essential in cloud systems to facilitate resource sharing among tenants. However, the growing scale of these optimization problems have outpaced commercial solvers commonly employed in production. To accelerate resource allocation, prior approaches either customize solutions for narrow domains or impose workload-specific assumptions. In this work, the authors revisit real-world resource allocation problems and uncover a common underlying structure: the vast majority of these problems are inherently separable, i.e., they optimize the aggregate utility of individual resource and demand allocations, under separate constraints for each resource and each demand. Building on this observation, they develop DeDe, a scalable and theoretically rooted optimization framework for large-scale resource allocation. At the core of DeDe is a decouple-and-decompose approach: it decouples entangled resource and demand constraints and thereby decomposes the overall optimization into alternating per-resource and per-demand subproblems that can be solved efficiently and in parallel. They have implemented and released DeDe as a Python package with a familiar modeling interface. Experiments on three representative resource allocation tasks -- cluster scheduling, traffic engineering, and load balancing -- demonstrate that DeDe delivers significant speedups while generating higher-quality allocations.},

  abstract = {The growing number of data centers consumes a vast amount of energy for processing. There is a desire to reduce the environmental footprint of the IT industry, and one way to achieve this is to use renewable energy sources. A challenge with using renewable resources is that the energy output is irregular as a consequence of the intermittent nature of this form of energy. In this paper, we propose a simple and yet efficient latency-aware workload scheduler that creates an energy-agile workload, by deferring tasks with low latency sensitivity to periods with excess renewable energy. The scheduler also increases the overall efficiency of the data center, by packing the workload into as few servers as possible, using neural-network-based predictions of resource usage on an individual task basis to avoid unnecessarily provisioning an excess number of servers. The scheduler was tested on a subset of real-world workload traces, and real-world wind-power generation data, simulating a small-scale data center co-located with a wind turbine. Extensive experimental results show that the devised scheduler reduced the number of servers doing work in periods of low wind-power production up to 93% of the time, by postponing tasks with a low latency sensitivity to a later interval.},
