Despite efforts to address challenges such as scaling model size and data volume, the cost associated with pre-training and fine-tuning remains substantial. The paper addresses the challenge of modality gap in pre-trained large multimodal models (LMMs), characterized by misalignment between textual and visual representations within a common embedding space. The authors propose a lightweight training-free approach utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extend across the modality using a linear mapping, which can be computed efficiently. During inference, this mapping is applied to images embedded by an LMM enabling retrieval of closest textual descriptions from the training set, which serve as input prompts for the language model to generate new textual descriptions.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in answering questions, but they lack domain-specific knowledge and are prone to hallucinations. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is one approach to address these challenges, while multimodal models are emerging as promising AI assistants for processing both text and images. This paper describes a series of experiments aimed at determining how to best integrate multimodal models into RAG systems for the industrial domain, specifically to determine whether including images alongside text from documents within the industrial domain increases RAG performance and to find the optimal configuration for such a multimodal RAG system. The results reveal that multimodal RAG can outperform single-modality RAG settings, although image retrieval poses a greater challenge than text retrieval.},

@misc{wang2024searching,
  abstract = {Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques have proven effective in integrating up-to-date information, mitigating hallucinations, and enhancing response quality, particularly in specialized domains. However, many RAG approaches suffer from complex implementation and prolonged response times. This paper investigates existing RAG approaches and their potential combinations to identify optimal RAG practices. The authors systematically examine multiple RAG workflow components including query classification, document processing, chunking, embedding types, vector database selection, and LLM fine-tuning strategies. Through extensive experiments, key findings include: query classification modules improve accuracy and reduce latency; hybrid search with HyDE excels in retrieval; MonoT5 and reverse repacking significantly enhance performance; while Recomp addresses length constraints, omitting summarization can reduce latency. The paper also demonstrates that multimodal retrieval techniques significantly enhance question-answering capabilities about visual inputs and accelerate multimodal content generation using a "retrieval as generation" strategy. A comprehensive evaluation framework with metrics covering general, specialized, and RAG-related capabilities provides robust assessment across different performance dimensions.},

@inproceedings{packowski2024optimizing,
  abstract = {Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a popular technique for using large language models (LLMs) to build customer-support, question-answering solutions. This paper shares practical experience building and maintaining enterprise-scale RAG solutions that answer users' questions about software based on product documentation. The authors focus on solution strategies that are modular and model-agnostic, noting that their experience has not always matched common patterns in RAG literature. A key finding is that simple changes to knowledge base content creation can have huge impact on RAG solutions' success across different search methods, LLMs, and knowledge base collections. The paper addresses practical considerations including content structure for knowledge base indexing, chunking strategies that balance information splitting versus irrelevant inclusion, and an approach to chunk content at chapter/section level rather than by size to include complete, self-contained ideas. The authors implement RAG as "search enhancement" where natural language questions generate both regular search results and LLM-generated brief answers, requiring no new interface for users to learn.},

  abstract = {As Large Language Models (LLMs) become popular, there emerged an important trend of using multimodality to augment the LLMs' generation ability, which enables LLMs to better interact with the world. However, there lacks a unified perception of at which stage and how to incorporate different modalities. In this survey, we review methods that assist and augment generative models by retrieving multimodal knowledge, whose formats range from images, codes, tables, graphs, to audio. Such methods offer a promising solution to important concerns such as factuality, reasoning, interpretability, and robustness. By providing an in-depth review, this survey is expected to provide scholars with a deeper understanding of the methods' applications and encourage them to adapt existing techniques to the fast-growing field of LLMs.},

@misc{liu2023m,
  abstract = {The current landscape of research leveraging large language models (LLMs) is experiencing a surge. Many works harness the powerful reasoning capabilities of these models to comprehend various modalities, such as images and audio. They typically employ frozen pre-trained encoders to represent these modalities as tokens, which are then fed into LLMs for processing. However, when it comes to music, most research has focused on discrimination tasks, such as music question answering, rather than on music generation. To address this gap, we introduce a Multi-modal Music Understanding and Generation (M²UGen) framework that integrates LLM's abilities to comprehend and generate music for different modalities. The M²UGen model incorporates frozen pre-trained encoders and utilizes encoders capable of comprehending various modalities including music, images, and videos, with a special attention on music generation conditioned on multimodal inputs.},
