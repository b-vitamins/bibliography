This twin acts as a mediator between the behavior cloning policy and the real robot.

The paper introduces CLoSD, a text-driven RL physics-based controller, guided by diffusion generation for various tasks. The key innovation is using motion diffusion as an on-the-fly universal planner for a robust RL controller through a closed-loop interaction between a Diffusion Planner and a tracking controller. CLoSD maintains a closed-loop interaction between two modules â€” a Diffusion Planner (DiP), and a tracking controller. DiP is a fast-responding autoregressive diffusion model, controlled by textual prompts and target locations, and the controller is a simple and robust motion imitator that continuously receives motion plans from DiP and provides feedback from the environment. CLoSD is capable of seamlessly performing a sequence of different tasks, including navigation to a goal location, striking an object with a hand or foot as specified in a text prompt, sitting down, and getting up.},

In this work, we propose RoboScape, a unified physics-informed world model that jointly learns RGB video generation and physics knowledge within an integrated framework. Specifically, RoboScape introduces two key physics-informed joint training tasks: temporal depth prediction that enhances 3D geometric consistency in video rendering, and keypoint dynamics learning that implicitly encodes physical properties (e.g., object shape and material characteristics). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboScape generates videos with superior visual fidelity and physical plausibility across diverse robotic scenarios.

Whether in model-based approaches (e.g., trajectory optimization), or model-free algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning), physics simulators are a central component of modern control pipelines in robotics. Over the past decades, several robotic simulators have been developed, each with dedicated contact modeling assumptions and algorithmic solutions. In this article, we survey the main contact models and the associated numerical methods commonly used in robotics for simulating advanced robot motions involving contact interactions. In particular, we recall the physical laws underlying contacts and friction (i.e., Signorini condition, Coulomb's law, and the maximum dissipation principle), and how they are transcribed in current simulators. For each physics engine, we expose their inherent physical relaxations along with their limitations due to the numerical techniques employed. Based on our study, we propose theoretically grounded quantitative criteria on which we build benchmarks assessing both the physical and computational aspects of simulation. We support our work with an open-source and efficient C++ implementation of the existing algorithmic variations. Our results demonstrate that some approximations or algorithms commonly used in robotics can severely widen the reality gap and impact target applications.},

This challenge necessitates new mathematical and algorithmic tools that enable adaptation and zero-shot transfer. To this end, we leverage the theory of function encoders, which enables zero-shot transfer by combining the flexibility of neural networks with the mathematical principles of Hilbert spaces. Using this theory, we first present a method for learning a space of dynamics spanned by a set of neural ODE basis functions. After training, the proposed approach can rapidly identify dynamics in the learned space using an efficient inner product calculation. Critically, this calculation requires no gradient calculations or retraining during the online phase. This method enables zero-shot transfer for autonomous systems at runtime and opens the door for a new class of adaptable control algorithms.

@inproceedings{jiang2023motiongpt,
  abstract = {MotionGPT proposes a unified, versatile, and user-friendly motion-language model to handle multiple motion-relevant tasks. The core insight is that human motion displays a semantic coupling akin to human language, often perceived as a form of body language. The authors employ discrete vector quantization for human motion and transfer 3D motion into motion tokens, similar to the generation process of word tokens. MotionGPT consists of a motion tokenizer responsible for converting raw motion data into discrete motion tokens, as well as a motion-aware language model that learns to understand the motion tokens from large language pre-training models. Building upon this "motion vocabulary", they perform language modeling on both motion and text in a unified manner, treating human motion as a specific language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionGPT achieves state-of-the-art performances on multiple motion tasks including text-driven motion generation, motion captioning, motion prediction, and motion in-between.},

  abstract = {Differentiable physics simulation provides an avenue to tackle previously intractable challenges through gradient-based optimization, thereby greatly improving the efficiency of solving robotics-related problems. However, current differentiable physics simulators typically handle either rigid or soft body dynamics but rarely both. This limitation restricts their applicability in manipulation scenarios involving diverse materials. We present SoftMAC, a simulation framework that couples soft bodies with articulated rigid bodies and clothes. Our approach enables comprehensive dynamic modeling and provides an explicit and differentiable coupling mechanism that allows for more general interactions, such as soft bodies serving as manipulators and engaging with underactuated systems. SoftMAC provides a novel forecast-based contact model for MPM which effectively reduces penetration without introducing artifacts like unnatural rebound. To couple MPM particles with deformable and non-volumetric clothes meshes, we propose a penetration tracing algorithm that reconstructs the signed distance field in local area. We validate our framework through comprehensive experiments on robotic manipulation applications with various soft, rigid, and cloth components.},

The previous research in robotic fluid manipulation mostly considered fluids as governed by an ideal, Newtonian model in simple task settings, while real-world fluid systems manifest complexities in terms of complex material behaviors and multi-component interactions. We present FluidLab, a simulation environment with a diverse set of manipulation tasks involving complex fluid dynamics. Tasks in FluidLab address interactions between solid and fluid as well as among multiple fluids. At the heart of the platform is a fully differentiable physics simulator called FluidEngine, providing GPU-accelerated simulations and gradient calculations for various material types and their couplings. We identify several challenges for fluid manipulation learning by evaluating reinforcement learning and trajectory optimization methods on our platform and propose domain-specific optimization schemes coupled with differentiable physics, which were shown to be effective in tackling optimization problems featured by fluid systems' non-convex and non-smooth properties.},

In this work, we present DexGraspNet, a large-scale robotic dexterous grasp dataset generated by our highly efficient synthesis method that can be generally applied to any dexterous hand. DexGraspNet contains 1.32 million grasps for 5355 objects, covering more than 133 object categories and containing more than 200 diverse grasps for each object on average. Our synthesis method leverages a deeply accelerated differentiable force closure estimator and thus can efficiently and robustly synthesize stable and diverse grasps on a large scale. All grasps have been validated by the Isaac Gym simulator. Compared to the previous dataset generated by GraspIt!, our dataset has not only more objects and grasps, but also higher diversity and quality. Via performing cross-dataset experiments, we show that training several algorithms of dexterous grasp synthesis on our dataset significantly outperforms training on the previous one.},

In robotics and related research fields, the study of understanding is often referred to as semantics, which dictates what does the world ``mean'' to a robot, and is strongly tied to the question of how to represent that meaning. With humans and robots increasingly operating in the same world, the prospects of human-robot interaction also bring semantics and ontology of natural language into the picture. Driven by need, as well as by enablers like increasing availability of training data and computational resources, semantics is a rapidly growing research area in robotics. This survey provides an overarching snapshot of where semantics in robotics stands today. We establish a taxonomy for semantics research in or relevant to robotics, split into four broad categories of activity, in which semantics are extracted, used, or both. Within these broad categories we survey dozens of major topics including fundamentals from the computer vision field and key robotics research areas utilizing semantics, including mapping, navigation and interaction with the world.},

Traditional rigid body simulators linearize constraints because they operate on the velocity level or solve the equations of motion implicitly thereby freezing the constraint directions for multiple iterations. Our method always works with the most recent constraint directions. This allows us to trace high speed motion of objects colliding against curved geometry, to reduce the number of constraints, to increase the robustness of the simulation, and to simplify the formulation of the solver. In this paper we provide all the details to implement a fully fledged rigid body solver that handles contacts, a variety of joint types and the interaction with soft objects.},

This poses challenges to traditional rigid-body physics engines. Particle-based simulators have been developed to model the dynamics of these complex scenes; however, relying on approximation techniques, their simulation often deviates from real-world physics, especially in the long term. We propose to learn a particle-based simulator for complex control tasks. Specifically, we present Dynamic Particle Interaction Networks (DPI-Nets) for learning particle dynamics, focusing on capturing the dynamic, hierarchical, and long-range interactions of particles. The learned simulator, just like other particle-based systems, acts widely on objects of different materials; the particle-based representation poses strong inductive bias for learning. DPI-Nets have successfully captured the complex behaviors of deformable objects, fluids, and rigid-bodies. With learned DPI-Nets, robots have achieved success in manipulation tasks that involve deformable objects of complex physical properties.},

  abstract = {An introduction to physically based modeling for rigid body simulation focusing on unconstrained rigid body dynamics. The solution is computed by numerically timestepping the ordinary differential equations of rigid body motion, derived from Newton's 2nd law, and conservation of linear momentum and angular momentum.},

  abstract = {This paper surveys recent work on dynamic simulation of rigid bodies with non-interpenetration constraints. The problems of collision detection and contact force determination are discussed, along with both frictionless and frictional collision and contact. For the collision-detection problem, methods which deal with objects' motion as a single continuous function of time are compared and contrasted.},
